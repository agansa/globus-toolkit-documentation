The Earth System Grid is a distributed system that collects and manages large quantities of climate data generated by simulation software.  The resulting datasets are made available for download by climate scientists via an easy-to-use Web interface.
</p>

<p>
In order to ensure that the distributed services that comprise the Earth System Grid remain available as much of the time as possible, a variety of tools are employed to monitor the services, to sound alarms if services fail, and to archive the system status data for later analysis. These tools are specifically used to monitor the current status and history of the Grid's Replica Location Services, OGSA-DAI data access services, and Web Portal services.
</p>

<p>
The ESG monitoring system uses the following components. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?=$SITE_PATHS["WEB_SOFTWARE"]."monitoring/index-service.php"; ?>">Globus Index 
Service</a> (version 3.2)</li>
<li><a href="<?=$SITE_PATHS["WEB_SOFTWARE"]."monitoring/archiver-service.php"; ?>">Globus 
Archiver Service</a> (version 3.2)</li>
<li><a href="<?=$SITE_PATHS["WEB_SOFTWARE"]."monitoring/trigger-service.php"; ?>">Globus 
Trigger Service</a> (version 3.2)</li>
<li>Web-based OGSI Service Data Viewer</li>
<li>Email alerts</li>
<li>Python test scripts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Although these tools were developed for the Earth System Grid, they are 
generalized and flexible and can be reused easily in other Grid applications.
