	<p>The Globus Alliance is an international collaboration that conducts 
           research and development to create fundamental Grid technologies. 
           The Grid lets people share computing power, databases, and other 
           on-line tools securely across corporate, institutional, and 
           geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy.
