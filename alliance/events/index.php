June 27, 2005<br>
<u>Chicago, IL</u><br>
This workshop at GGF-14 will include an introduction to the Globus Toolkit, version
4.0, by members of the Globus Toolkit development community. It will also include
descriptions of early experiences with GT4 in Grid application deployment projects,
presented by members of the Globus Toolkit user community.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.grids-center.org/train/June2005.asp">2005 GRIDS 
Center Community Workshop</a></b><br>
June 23-24, 2005<br>
<u>Chicago, IL</u><br>
This workshop brings together leaders and technical staff from leading 
Cyberinfrastructure development and deployment projects to encourage
cross-discipline interactions involving Grid middleware.  
Many groups have overlapping or very similar middleware needs, and the GRIDS 
leadership wants to help identify these targets of opportunity that will 
maximize benefits to the greater scientific community through coordinated 
effort and reduced duplication.</p>

<p><b>2 Day Programming Tutorial with WSRF and the Globus Toolkit Version 4</b><br>
May 3-4, 2005<br>
<u>San Diego, CA</u><br>
These two days of tutorials provide an in-depth introduction to programming with the 
latest version of the Globus Toolkit (GT4).  The course is geared toward developers 
who want to learn about the newest work of the Globus Alliance and how to apply 
fundamental concepts in Grid computing.  The first day teaches developers how to 
build a Java Service that makes use of GT4 mechanisms for state management, security, 
registry, and related topics.  The second day is less hands on and more 
presentation-oriented. It provides a comprehensive introduction to GT4, covering 
execution management services, data movement and management services, and security services, and also 
reviewing some of the higher-level tools that build on Globus mechanisms. A brief 
introduction to administering a GT4-based Grid is also provided. To register,
