<p><b>Cyberinfrastructure Seminar Series: "GridShib: An Attribute-Based Authorization Framework"</b><br>
11:00am-12:30pm PDT<br>
December 6, 2005<br>
<u>Access Grid, SDSC Auditorium, Webcast</u><br>
The Globus Toolkit is the leading toolkit for the deployment of grids. Shibboleth is a 
project from the Internet2 community that allows for cross-organizational sharing of web 
resources. GridShib builds on these existing technologies to allow for interoperability 
between them so that virtual organizations built on Globus Toolkit can leverage 
Shibboleth.  This talk provides overviews of the Globus Toolkit, Shibboleth, and GridShib, 
as well as future challenges. The talk will be technical, but will not presume an 
understanding of security. The Cyberinfrastructure Seminar Series is a set of 
presentations on cyberinfrastructure and related research organized by NCSA and SDSC. 
These seminars are available on site at the presenting institution and remotely via the 
Access Grid and webcast via <a href="www.cichannel.org">CI Channel</a>. For more details 
regarding the AG venue for this seminar, please refer to 
<a href="http://agschedule.ncsa.uiuc.edu/meetingdetails.asp?MID=9804">the AG scheduler</a>. 
All Access Grid sites are welcome to participate in this seminar. If you have any questions,

Tutorial: The Globus Toolkit in e-Science: Examples and Lessons</a></b><br>
November 13, 2005<br>
<u>Seattle, WA</u><br>
This half-day tutorial provides three case studies from successful e-Science projects and 
highlights the lessons learned from those experiences. Three challenging IT problems will 
be presented in the context of specific science projects. The tutorial will explore the 
science requirements, the technical approach taken in each solution, and the results. 
Reusable Grid technologies from the Globus Toolkit such as GridFTP, MyProxy, and GRAM will 
be introduced. Along the way, we will highlight the general lessons that these experiences 
provided and the implications for new e-Science projects.</p>

<p><b>2 Day Programming Tutorial with WSRF and the Globus Toolkit Version 4</b><br>
May 3-4, 2005<br>
<u>San Diego, CA</u><br>
These two days of tutorials provide an in-depth introduction to programming with the 
latest version of the Globus Toolkit (GT4).  The course is geared toward developers 
who want to learn about the newest work of the Globus Alliance and how to apply 
fundamental concepts in Grid computing.  The first day teaches developers how to 
build a Java Service that makes use of GT4 mechanisms for state management, security, 
registry, and related topics.  The second day is less hands on and more 
presentation-oriented. It provides a comprehensive introduction to GT4, covering 
execution management services, data movement and management services, and security services, and also 
reviewing some of the higher-level tools that build on Globus mechanisms. A brief 
introduction to administering a GT4-based Grid is also provided. To register,
