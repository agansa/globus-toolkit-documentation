    <p>See <b>Globus@Work</b> at SC2004!</p>
    
    <p>During the conference, the Globus Toolkit will be demonstrated in action by numerous 
application demonstrations around the exhibit hall.  The Globus Project will also
    be represented by paper presentations, tutorials, posters, and other conference activities.</p>

<p>Paper submissions are not a major focus of the Globus Alliance at SC2004. 
Nevertheless, the following two papers--co-authored by Alliance members--were accepted for 
presentation this year.</p>

<p><b>The Inca Test Harness and Reporting Framework.</b> 
S. Smallen, C. Olschanowsky, K. Ericson, P. Beckman, J. Schopf.</p>

<p>The Grid2004 conference is traditionally held in conjunction with SC conferences,
offering a venue for papers focusing on Grid applications and technologies. Globus Alliance
members are presenting the following papers at the Grid2004 conference.</p>

<p><b>From Sandbox to Playground: Dynamic Virtual Environments in the Grid.</b>
K. Keahey, K. Doering, I. Foster.</p>

<p><b>Implementation and Evaluation of a ReplicaSet Grid Service.</b>
M. Manohar, A. Chervenak, B. Clifford, C. Kesselman.</p>

<p><b><a name="SC04Tutorials">Tutorials</a></b></p>

<p>Tutorials provide attendees an opportunity for intensive learning on a particular topic 
of interest.  This year, the Globus Alliance offers the following two half-day tutorials 
at SC2004.</p>

<p><b>M09: Virtual Data Management for Grid Computing</b><br>
Monday, November 8, 8:30am - 12:00pm<br>
Michael Wilde, Argonne National Laboratory<br>
Gaurang Mehta and Karan Vahi, University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute</p>

<p>Virtual data is a paradigm for expressing and managing the relationships between 
datasets and the computational procedures that produce them. It provides 
abstractions to describe data that does not yet been computed, and is embodied 
in a toolkit which automates workflow generation and data provenance tracking 
for problems ranging from desktop analysis to massive-scale computations on a 
Grid.</p>

<p>In a virtual data system, data, procedures, and computations are 
all first class entities, and can be published, discovered, and manipulated. 
Virtual data enables us to trace the provenance of derived data; plan and track 
the computational workflows required to derive a particular data product; 
determine whether a requested computation has been performed previously and 
whether it is cheaper to rerun it or to retrieve previously generated data; and 
discover computational procedures with desired characteristics.</p>

<p>This 
tutorial describes the foundations of the virtual data concept, presents a 
practical, "how-to" focused introduction to the Grid-based virtual data tools 
created by GriPhyN, the Grid Physics Network project, explores related work in 
the fields of provenance tracking and workflow management, and presents case 
studies of virtual data on computing problems in high-energy physics, biology, 
medical research, astronomy and astrophysics. </p>

<p><b>M12: Beyond Globus: Lessons Learned from the Grid</b><br> 
Monday, November 8, 8:30am - 12:00pm<br>
Lee Liming, Argonne National Laboratory</p>

<p>The Globus Alliance aims to provide solutions to the most persistent and vexing 
problems that come up in Grid projects and applications. Our solutions to date 
are collected in the Globus Toolkit and these solutions are used in many Grid 
applications and systems.</p>

<p>While the Globus Toolkit makes it easier to 
conduct Grid-based projects, the challenges are still far from easy and the 
Globus Toolkit does not provide a "turnkey" solution. Success in a Grid project 
depends on a clear vision of the problem(s) to be solved, awareness of relevant 
tools (both within and beyond the Globus Toolkit), and a strategy for applying 
the technology.</p>

<p>This half-day tutorial provides answers to critical 
questions for Grid project planners and product developers, 
including: What types of problems is the Grid intended to address? How 
far does the Globus Toolkit go toward solving these problems? What do you need 
besides the Globus Toolkit to have a useful solution to your problem?</p>

<p>The Globus Toolkit will be put into context, and examples and roadmaps for the most 
common uses of the Globus Toolkit will be provided.</p>
