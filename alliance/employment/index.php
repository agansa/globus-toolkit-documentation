<h1 class="first">Employment Opportunities</font></h1>
<p> <a href="../news/rd100.html"><img border="0" src="../images/rd100-new-100.gif" align="right" width="100" height="103"></a>In 1998, the Globus Project (now the Globus Alliance) was honored with the
 prestigious Global Information Infrastructure <!--<a href="../news/press/gii_release.html"> -->
"Next Generation" award, and in 2002, we received an <a href="../news/rd100.html"> R&amp;D 
100 award</a>. The New York Times recently called the Globus Toolkit 
"the <i> de facto </i> standard for Grid computing."  We are frequently referenced in
<a href="../news/"> scientific publications  and the general media</a>. 
We've formed partnerships and collaborations with <a href="../participants.php#affiliates"> 
organizations around the world</a> to design and build the Grid.  We are leaders in and charter sponsors of the <a href="http://www.gridforum.org/"> Global Grid Forum</a>, the 
current standards organization for the Grid.</p>

<p>Now, we're looking for talented individuals to join us in this work!  Positions are available at <a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a> in 
Chicago, at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, and at the University of Southern California's
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a> in Los Angeles. All three institutions offer excellent 
benefits, state-of-the-art facilities, a rich intellectual environment, exposure to national 
and international collaborations, and the opportunity to work on exciting and 
ground-breaking projects. Visiting positions for faculty and students are also possible.</p>

<td valign=top width="50%"><b>Research Programmers</b><br>
Programmers in the Globus Alliance are the first people to implement new Grid
protocols, APIs, and services.  Our software
is used by projects all over the world to build large-scale systems and applications 
for advanced science and engineering. [<a href="programmers.php">more</a>]</td>

<td valign=top width="50%"><b>Graduate and Undergraduate Students</b><br>
Students can join us for a semester or longer to work on well-defined projects. 
Argonne, for example, offers an Undergraduate Program in Computational Science. 
Graduate students can also enter the University of Chicago or University of Southern 
California.</td>

<td valin=top width="50%"><b>Scientific Staff</b><br>
The Globus Alliance employs scientists and engineers with outstanding records of
accomplishment to lead explorations into applied Computer and Computational
Science.  Members of the scientific staff define research programs and lead 
teams of researchers, programmers, students, and external partners. [<a href="scientists.php">more</a>]</td>

<td valign=top width="50%"><b>Postdoctoral Researchers</b><br>
Recent PhD recipients can work with senior researchers at Argonne, the 
the Information Sciences Institute, or the University of Chicago.  Postdoctoral
researchers work with programmers and external partners to develop tools and
applications and work with researchers to write and present papers and other
forms of scientific communication. [<a href="postdocs.php">more</a>]</td>
