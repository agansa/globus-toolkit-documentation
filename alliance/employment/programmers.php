<h1> Research programmers </h1>

<p><b><i>We walk where the gods of Corporate Software fear to tread!</i></b></p>

<p>So you can use CORBA, JINI, XML, C#, Java, and SOAP with no fear?<br>
Well, that's a start.  We're not just looking for people who know how to use this year's hottest 
technologies.  We're looking for people to <em>create</em> the hot technologies for the
<i>next decade!</i></p>

<p>Like the developers of the original Internet software, our programmers
develop the first, ground-breaking implementations of Grid protocols, APIs and services. Our software is used by <a href="../activities/related.php">projects all 
over the world</a> to build <a href="../../research/testbeds.html"></a> large-scale environments for <a href="../../research/applications/"></a> scientific and
engineering application, and our proposed standards are being reviewed by the 
Global Grid Forum and the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>

      <p>We're looking for talented programmers to join our project.  Ideal
candidates have a both a firm grounding in traditional computer science and
familiarity with the latest programming environments.  They've also
accomplished innovative system-level or network programming of their own. If you've
ever added a feature to the Linux kernel, implemented a network protocol, written a multi-threaded message dispatcher, written a web server from
scratch, or built a complex distributed computing application (you know who you are!), we want to hear from you!</p>

      <p>Employment in the Globus Project offers excellent benefits.  For starters, we
work with some of the brightest people in the world on cutting-edge scientific
and engineering projects.  Our salaries are competitive with the software industry, 
and we provide excellent benefits packages.  Our locations include the beaches of 
Marina del Rey (Los Angeles, CA), the urban culture of Hyde Park (Chicago, 
IL), and the midwestern quiet of suburban Chicago (Argonne National Laboratory
and Univa).
      We value our quality of life: dress is casual (as a rule), attendance is
      flexible, and position descriptions are always negotiable.</p>

<p>Applicants should have a BS or higher degree in computer science or a
related field, a strong desire to learn about new technologies, an ability
to deal with complex and open-ended problems, and a commitment to producing
high-quality software.</p>

<p><b>If you want a job where you can <i>define</i> the leading edge, this is it.
For consideration at Argonne, University of Chicago, or USC ISI, send your resume to 
<a href="mailto:jobs@globus.org">jobs@globus.org</a>.
Please also consider employment at <a href="http://www.univa.com/jobs.shtml">Univa</a>.</b></p>
