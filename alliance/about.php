	<h1 class="first">About the Globus Alliance</h1>

The Globus Alliance conducts research and development to create fundamental technologies behind 
the &quot;Grid,&quot; which lets people share computing power, databases, and other on-line tools securely across corporate,    
institutional, and geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy. Based at <a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>,
the University of Southern California's <a href="http://www.isi.edu/">
Information Sciences Institute</a>,  the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">
University of Chicago</a>, the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of
Edinburgh</a>, and the Swedish <a href="http://www.pdc.kth.se/">Center for
 Parallel Computers</a>, the alliance produced open-source software that is central to science and engineering activities totalling nearly a half-billion dollars internationally and is the substrate for significant Grid products offered by leading IT companies.  The   
<a href="participants.php">Globus Alliance Affiliates</a> program recognizes the participation of other important organizations as contributors or as users.</p>


<p>The <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/staging"> Globus Toolkit</a><sup>TM</sup> includes software services and libraries for 
    resource monitoring, discovery, and management, plus security and file 
    management. Its latest version, GT3, is the first 
   full-scale implementation of new Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) 
   specifications that the Globus Alliance is playing an important role in 
    defining. The components originally released in our previous-generation toolkit, GT2, are still included in GT3 as the Grid community makes the transition to OGSA-compliant services.</p>


    <p>Just as the Web has 
    revolutionized access to information,
    the Globus Alliance aims to achieve a similar result in computation. 
    New types of applications will be possible when accessing supercomputers, live satellite imagery, mass storage and other on-line resources becomes as straightforward as using the Web. That is the promise of Grid computing.</p>
