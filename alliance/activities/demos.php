<h1>Live Technology Demonstrations at SC2004</h1>
   
<p>Demonstrations of the latest Grid technologies and their applications in science have 
traditionally been the Globus Alliance's strong suit at Supercomputing conferences. 
This year, the Globus Alliance is proud to offer fifteen live technology demonstrations 
and nine presentations highlighting some of this year's work with our partners in science and business, 
funded by U.S. and European government agencies and corporations.</p>

<p>Visit us in booth R339 to see any of these demonstrations or to talk with Globus 
Alliance members about our work.</p>
