           Grid 2: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure</a></b><br>
        Edited by Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman<br>
        Morgan Kaufmann; 2 edition (November 18, 2003)<br>
        ISBN: 1558609334
        <p>In 1998, Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman introduced a whole 
           new concept in computing with the first edition of this book. 
           Today there is a broader and deeper understanding of the nature 
           of the opportunities offered by Grid computing and the 
           technologies needed to realize those opportunities. In Grid 2, 
           the editors reveal the revolutionary impact of large-scale 
           resource sharing and virtualization within science and industry, 
           the intimate relationships between organization and resource 
           sharing structures and the new technologies required to enable 
           secure, reliable, and efficient resource sharing on large scale.</p>
           <p>Foster and Kesselman have once again assembled a team of 
           experts to present an up-to-date view of Grids that reports on 
           real experiences and explains the available technologies and new 
           technologies emerging from labs, companies and standards bodies. 
           Grid 2, like its predecessor, serves as a manifesto, design 
           blueprint, user guide and research agenda for future Grid systems.</p>

           Resource Management: State of the Art and Future Trends</a></b><br>
        Edited by Jarek Nabrzyski, Jennifer M. Schopf, Jan Weglarz<br>
        Springer; 1 edition (September, 2003)<br>
        ISBN: 1402075758
        <p>Grid Resource Management: State of the Art and Future Trends 
           presents an overview of the state of the field and describes 
           both the real experiences and the current research available 
           today. Grid computing is a rapidly developing and changing 
           field, involving the shared and coordinated use of dynamic, 
           multi-institutional resources. Grid resource management is 
           the process of identifying requirements, matching resources 
           to applications, allocating those resources, and scheduling 
           and monitoring Grid resources over time in order to run Grid 
           applications as efficiently as possible. While Grids have 
           become almost commonplace, the use of good Grid resource 
           management tools is far from ubiquitous because of the many 
           open issues of the field, including the multiple layers of 
           schedulers, the lack of control over resources, the fact that 
           resources are shared, and that users and administrators have 
           conflicting performance goals. These are the issues addressed 
           in this book, in addition to elucidating the overlap with 
           related areas including discussions of work with peer-to-peer 
           computing, economic approaches, and operations research. Grid 
           Resource Management: State of the Art and Future Trends is 
           an invaluable resource for today's user, application 
           developer, or resource owners when working with Grid resource 
           management systems.</p>
