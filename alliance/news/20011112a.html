<p class="title">12 Companies Adopt Argonne Lab/USC Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> as standard Grid Technology Platform</p>

<p>The open source Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> developed by USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and Argonne National Laboratory today became the de-facto international standard in the burgeoning field of grid computing as 12 leading computer vendors and software 
providers in the U.S. and Japan announced that they will port and/or support the product. 
Globus scientists and corporate representatives made the announcement at the SC 2001 
high performance networking and computing convention in Denver, CO.</p>

<p>Eight firms, including <b>Compaq</b>, <b>Cray</b>, <b>SGI</b>, <b> Sun
Microsystems</b>, and <b> Veridian</b> from the 
United States, and <b>Fujitsu</b>, <b>Hitachi</b>, and <b> NEC</b> in Japan, will adopt the Globus Toolkit 
and develop an optimized form of it for their platforms, as their preferred path toward 
secure, distributed, multi-vendor, Grid computing. Three other American companies,
<b>Entropia</b>, <b>IBM</b>, and <b>Microsoft</b>, simultaneously announced deepening of commitments 
previously made. <b> Platform Computing Inc</b> on Nov. 7 announced that it will collaborate 
with Globus to provide a commercially supported version of the Globus Toolkit. </p>

<p>Spokesmen for the companies involved used words like "megatrend for information 
technology in this century," "potential to bring Grid computing to millions," "powerful &#8230; 
tremendous advances in computer power and flexibility," to describe the potential of Grid 
computing and the Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup>. (For complete statements by company 
representatives, with company press contact information, please refer to <a href="20011112b.html"> accompanying statement page</a>.)</p>
   
    
<p>"We're very excited to see this breadth of support for the Globus Toolkit," said Ian 
Foster, Globus Project lead at Argonne and the University of Chicago. "We see this as 
just the first step towards broad industrial adoption of Grid technologies &#8212; and better 
support for the numerous existing users in the research and education space." </p>

<p>"Today marks a giant step forward not just for Globus but for grid computing, which I 
believe is an essential tool for the science, engineering, and business needs of the future," 
said Carl Kesselman, director of the ISI Center for Grid Technologies.</p>

<p>Grid computing is a technology that uses the Internet as basic wiring to let people share 
computing, storage, data, programs, and other resources, just like the electric power grid 
allows people and energy companies to share generators of all kinds. The goal is to allow 
anyone with a computer to effectively integrate instruments, displays, and computational 
and information resources over a variety of computer platforms. </p>

<p>Argonne National Laboratory and ISI (which is part of the USC School of Engineering) 
have been working on the Globus approach to grids for six years. The Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> 
is an open-architecture, open-source set of protocols, services, and tools that address 
central problems in Grid computing &#8212; the secure, scalable, and coordinated sharing and 
use of resources in dynamic, multi-institutional "virtual organizations." </p>

<p>Explains Steven Tuecke, Globus Toolkit lead architect at Argonne, "the Globus Toolkit 
provides many of the basic protocols and services required to enable reliable and secure 
interoperation of Grid systems, whether within an international scientific collaboration or 
a company."</p>

<p>Grid concepts and the Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> have seen widespread adoption over the past two 
years in the research and education area, with dozens of major projects worldwide 
applying these concepts and technologies to challenging problems in scientific and 
technical computing.</p>

<p>The announcement today culminates a major series of recent endorsements for the 
Globus approach, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>	On September 24, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) announced a $12.1 
million "NSF Middleware Initiative" building on Globus. Said an NSF spokesman: 
"Much as the NSFnet network, established in 1985 laid the groundwork for the 
dramatic success of the Internet, we expect this NSF Middleware Initiative to lay 
foundations for the Grid, and spur adoption of the advanced services that will define 
the networks and distributed systems of tomorrow."
</li><li>	On August 27, NSF announced a $10 million grant to create a national virtual 
"collaboratory" to allow engineers to share equipment, data and research tools in 
order to create better techniques to safeguard structures against earthquakes. It will 
use Globus technology and the Globus partners will be co-investigators.
</li><li>	The U.S. Department of Energy this summer announced the investment of around $30 
million to researchers including the Globus partners to conduct R&amp;D aimed at 
creating "national collaboratories" in support of climate, high energy physics, fusion, 
and other science disciplines.
</li><li>	Globus will play a key role in the recently announced NSF Distributed Terascale 
Facility, which will put in place 13.6 Teraflops of computing, based on Itanium 
clusters connected by a 40 gigabit per second network.
</li><li>	The European Union and U.K. eScience program also recently announced a suite of 
Grid projects that build on Globus technologies.
</li></ul>

<p>The announcements of industrial support are part of the Globus Project<sup>TM</sup>'s new Industrial 
Grid Program, which facilitates a variety of industrial porting and support models for the 
Globus Toolkit.  For example, IBM and Platform plan to distribute the Toolkit and 
provide commercial support.  Microsoft is funding Argonne National Laboratory to 
exploit advanced Windows features.  Entropia and Veridian are incorporating support for 
Globus protocols into their enterprise software.  Cray, Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Sun 
Microsystems, and SGI are porting the software and developing advanced interfaces to 
their own software.  All participants are committed to contributing modifications to the 
Globus Toolkit open source code base.</p>

<p><b>About the Globus Project: </b> The Globus Project is a multi-institutional research and 
development effort creating fundamental technologies for computational grids. Grids are 
persistent environments that enable software applications to integrate instruments, 
displays, computational and information resources that are managed by diverse 
organizations in widespread locations. A primary product of the Globus Project is the 
open source Globus Toolkit, which is being used in numerous large Grid deployment and 
application projects in the United States, Europe, and around the world. The Globus 
Project is based at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Southern 
California's Information Sciences Institute.  Work on the Globus Project was funded
first by DARPA and subsequently also by DOE, NASA, and NSF.  For more information, 
visit the Globus Project web site at www.globus.org.</p>

<p><b>About ANL: </b> The nation's first national laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory 
conducts basic and applied scientific research across a wide spectrum of disciplines, 
ranging from high-energy physics to climatology and biotechnology. Since 1990, 
Argonne has worked with more than 600 companies and numerous federal agencies and 
other organizations to help advance America's scientific leadership and prepare the nation 
for the future. Argonne is operated by the University of Chicago as part of the U.S. 
Department of Energy's national laboratory system.</p>
