<p class="title">European Data Grid Builds on the Globus Toolkit</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eu-datagrid.org/">DataGrid Project</a> is an international
    project for shared cost research and technological development. The project has six main
    partners (listed below) and fifteen associated partners.</p>
<ul>
      <li>CERN - The European Organization for Nuclear Research</li>
      <li>CNRS - Le Comité National de la Recherche Scientifique (France) </li>
      <li>ESRIN - The European Space Agency </li>
      <li>INFN - Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (Italy) </li>
      <li>NIKHEF - The National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics  (The Netherlands)</li>
      <li>PPARC - Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (U.K.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective of the project is to enable next generation scientific exploration which
    requires intensive computation and analysis of shared large-scale databases, from hundreds
    of TeraBytes to PetaBytes, across widely distributed scientific communities.  These
    requirements are emerging in many scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and
    earth sciences. Such sharing is made complicated by the distributed nature of the
    resources to be used, the distributed nature of the communities, the size of the databases
    and the limited network bandwidth available.</p>


<p>The DataGrid Project will build on emerging computational Grid technologies, such as that developed by the Globus Project, to:</p>
<ul>   <li>establish a Research Network that will enable the development of the technology components essential for the implementation of a new worldwide Data Grid on a scale not previously attempted; </li>
      <li>demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology through the large-scale deployment of end-to-end application experiments involving real users; </li>
      <li>demonstrate the ability to build, connect and effectively manage large general-purpose, data intensive computer clusters constructed from low-cost commodity components.</li>
</ul>
