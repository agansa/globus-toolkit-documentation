<p class="title">Globus Toolkit<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2.0 Wins R&amp;D 100 Award</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.rdmag.com/">R&amp;D</a></i>, the magazine of research
 and development, has awarded a 2002 R&amp;D 100 award to the 
 Globus Toolkit 2.0, the Globus Project's software for Grid computing.</p>

<p>Since 1963, the R&amp;D 100 awards have recognized each year's most 
technologically significant innovations.  Prior winners have included the 
developers of Polacolor film (1963), the automated teller machine (1973), 
the halogen lamp (1974), the fax machine (1975), the liquid crystal display 
(1980), antismoking nicotine patch (1992), Taxol anticancer drugs 
(1993),  and HDTV (1998).  See

a further honor, the Globus Toolkit won an "Editors' Choice" award for
"Most Promising New Technology" at the R&amp;D 100 Awards ceremony on
October 16 at Navy Pier in Chicago. The new issue of Research and
Development Magazine features stories about the winners.

<p><b>The de Facto Standard for Grid Computing</b></p>

<p>The Globus Toolkit is central to distributed computing, one of the hottest 
topics in information technology.  Seemingly each day brings a new magazine or
 newspaper story about the commercial impact of Grids, and specifically about
 the Globus Project software that <i> The New York Times</i> recently called 
the "de facto standard" for Grid computing.</p>

<p>The 2002 R&amp;D 100 award brings further recognition to Globus Project 
leaders Ian Foster, 
associate director of the ANL Mathematics and Computer Science Division (MCS);  Steve 
Tuecke, lead architect in the MCS Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSL);  and their colleague, 
Carl Kesselman, director of the Center for Grid Technologies at the University of Southern 
California's Information Sciences Institute.  
</p>

<p>Since its 1996 inception, the project has been dedicated to the open-source philosophy of sharing 
resources to maximize progress and community benefits.  The toolkit -- which includes software 
services and libraries for resource monitoring, discovery, and management, plus security and file 
management -- is now central to science and engineering projects that total nearly a half-billion 
dollars internationally, and it is the substrate on which many companies are building significant 
commercial Grid products.

<p>To coincide with the November 2001 release of Globus Toolkit 2.0, eight firms -- Compaq, Cray, 
SGI, Sun, Veridian, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC -- announced they will develop an optimized form 
of the toolkit for their operating platforms as a path toward secure, distributed, multi-vendor Grid 
computing.  Three other companies -- Entropia, IBM, and Microsoft -- simultaneously announced 
expansions of previous commitments to the Globus Project.  Platform Computing has since 
released a commercially supported version of the toolkit.</p>

<p>IBM has since joined in development of the next-generation Globus Toolkit 
3.0, to be based on <!--<a href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/">--> 
Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA)</a> specifications being drafted by Foster, Tuecke, 
Kesselman and IBM colleagues.  IBM compares its commitment to the Globus Project with its 
earlier move to support the Linux operating system, a successful effort begun in 2000 and slated 
for $1 billion in near-term investment.  So the Globus Toolkit is clearly "big business," even if its 
creators are not motivated by personal profit.</p>

<p>"All of our industrial participants are committed to contributing modifications to the Globus 
Toolkit open-source code base," said ANL's Foster, who is also a University of Chicago (U of C) 
computer science professor and a fellow of the ANL/U of C Computational Institute.  "Our vision 
of seamlessly sharing distributed resources is now within reach for most businesses, thanks to the 
increasing affordability and speed of desktop computers and of commodity networks that can be 
aggregated to deliver supercomputer-level performance."</p>
