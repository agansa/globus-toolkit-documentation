<p class="title">***NSF PLEDGES $53 MILLION FOR A DISTRIBUTED TERASCALE FACILITY***</p>

<br>NCSA, SDSC, Argonne, and Caltech to build world's most powerful computational infrastructure
<br>
<p>SAN DIEGO, CA -- August 9, 2001 -- The National Science Foundation (NSF) 
has awarded $53 million to four U.S. research institutions to build and deploy 
a distributed terascale facility (DTF). The DTF will be the largest, most
comprehensive infrastructure ever deployed for scientific research--with
more than 13.6 teraflops (trillions of calculations per second) of computing
power as well as facilities capable of managing and storing more than 450
erabytes (trillions of bytes) of data.</p>

<p>The four research institutions in the DTF project are the National Center 
for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the
University of California at San Diego, Argonne National Laboratory
(Argonne), and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Each
institution plays a key role in the NSF's Partnerships for Advanced
omputational Infrastructure (PACI) program, which is building the 21st
century's information infrastructure. NCSA leads the National
Computational Science Alliance (Alliance), and SDSC leads the National
Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI). Argonne
is a major Alliance partner, and Caltech is a key NPACI partner. The
partnership expects to work primarily with IBM, Intel Corporation, and
Qwest Communications to build the facility, along with Myricom, Sun
Microsystems, and Oracle Corporation.</p>

<p>Linux clusters purchased through the DTF award and distributed across
the four DTF sites will total 11.6 teraflops of computing power. In addition,
two teraflop Linux cluster systems already in use at NCSA will be
integrated into the DTF system, creating the 13.6-teraflop system--the
most powerful distributed computing system ever. Besides offering the
world's fastest unclassified supercomputers, the DTF's hardware and
software will include ultra high-speed networks, high-resolution
visualization environments, and toolkits for grid computing. All of these
components will be tightly integrated into an information infrastructure
dubbed the "TeraGrid." Scientists and industry researchers across the
country will be able to tap this infrastructure to solve scientific problems.
</p>

<p>"Nothing like the DTF has ever been attempted before. This will be the
largest, most comprehensive infrastructure ever deployed for open
scientific research," said Dan Reed, director of NCSA and the Alliance
and a principal investigator of the DTF award. "Unprecedented amounts of
data are being generated by new observatories and sensors, and groups
of scientists are conducting new simulations of increasingly complex
phenomena. This new age of science requires a sustainable national
infrastructure that can bring together new tools, powerful computers, and
the best minds in the country. This is the infrastructure that will allow us to
solve the most pressing scientific problems of our time."</p>


<p>The DTF will consist primarily of clustered IBM servers based on Intel®
Itanium^Ù family processors interconnected with Myricom's Myrinet. It will
build upon two existing clusters of 1,300-plus Itanium and IA-32
processors already deployed at NCSA. The clusters will operate as a
single distributed facility, linked via a dedicated optical network that will
initially operate at 40 gigabits per second and later be upgraded to 50-80
gigabits per second. This DTF network, developed in partnership with
Qwest, will transport data 16 times faster than the fastest research
networks now in operation. It will connect to Abilene, the high-performance
network that links more than 180 research institutions across the country;
STAR TAP, an interconnect point in Chicago that provides access to and
from international research networks; and CENIC's CalREN-2, an
advanced high-speed network that connects institutions in California. In
Illinois, the I-WIRE optical network will provide the DTF with network
capacity and will give Argonne and NCSA additional bandwidth for related
network research initiatives.</p>


<p>"Breakthrough discoveries in fields from biology and genomics to
astronomy depend critically on computational and data management
infrastructure as a first-class scientific tool," said Fran Berman, director of
NPACI and SDSC and a principal investigator of the DTF award. "The
TeraGrid recognizes the increasing importance of data-oriented
computing and connection of data archives, remote instruments,
computational sites, and visualization over high-speed networks. The
TeraGrid will be a far more powerful and flexible scientific tool than any
single supercomputing system."</p>

<p>"The investment we have made in VentureTECH has helped secure this
award and once again shows our ability to leverage substantial new
resources for Illinois," said Governor George H. Ryan. "I am proud to
acknowledge the National Science Foundation's recognition of the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications and Argonne National
Lab's leadership in the Distributed Terascale Facility initiative," said Ryan.
</p>

<p>Each of the four DTF sites will play a unique role in the project.
<br>*NCSA will lead the TeraGrid project's computational aspects with an
IBM Linux cluster powered by the next generation of Intel® Itanium^Ù
processors, code named McKinley. The cluster's peak performance will be
8 teraflops, combining the DTF-funded systems and other NCSA clusters,
with 240 terabytes of secondary storage.</p>

<p>*SDSC will lead the TeraGrid data and knowledge management effort by 
deploying a data-intensive IBM Linux cluster based on Intel Itanium family
processors (McKinley). This system will have a peak performance of just
over 4 teraflops and 225 terabytes of network disk storage. In addition, a
next-generation Sun Microsystems high-end server will provide a gateway
to grid-distributed data for data-oriented applications.</p>

<p>*Argonne will lead the effort to deploy advanced distributed computing
software, high-resolution rendering and remote visualization capabilities,
and networks. This effort will require a 1-teraflop IBM Linux cluster with
parallel visualization hardware.</p>

<p>*Caltech will focus on providing online access to very large scientific data
collections and will facilitate access to those data by connecting
data-intensive applications to components of the TeraGrid. Caltech will
deploy a 0.4-teraflop IBM Itanium processor family (McKinley) cluster and
an IA-32 cluster that will manage 86 terabytes of online storage.</p>

<p>"The NSF is a leading indicator of future bandwidth demand, and the
launch of this network provides the latest and largest step in bandwidth
demand, not unlike the NSFnet, which was the original core of the Internet,"
 said Wesley Kaplow, chief technology officer of Qwest Government
Systems Division. "A number of industries will be able to witness the
power of these incredibly high-speed network and computer systems,
fueling the demand for network bandwidth to connect their U.S. and
worldwide supercomputing systems."</p>

<p>"The DTF project uses computational building blocks based on the Itanium
processor family to empower scientific and business communities to
address problems of monumental importance. These problems range from
astrophysical research such as black hole simulation, to molecular
modeling for the discovery of new drugs and cures, to crash simulations
that protect human life while reducing costs in the automotive industry,"
said Abhi Talwalker, vice president and assistant general manager,
Enterprise Platforms Group, Intel Corporation. "Intel is committed to
supporting this kind of important research with Intel-architecture-based
building blocks and solutions enabling efforts that allow governments,
educational institutions, and industry to afford and sustain the highest
performance possible."</p>

<p>"IBM's leadership in supercomputing technology and our commitment to
Linux and open standards enable us to provide the world's most powerful
computers," said David Turek, IBM vice president of Linux emerging
technologies. "Leveraging our strong relationship with Intel and Myricom in
conjunction with Qwest, we look forward to building a Grid computing
system that represents an important step in the evolution of the Internet and
scientific collaboration."</p>
