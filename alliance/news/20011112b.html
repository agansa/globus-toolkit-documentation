engineering. </i></p>


<p><b>Entropia</b><br>
<i>Entropia, Inc.'s Enterprise distributed computing grid technology harnesses the vast untapped 
processing power of PCs on corporate networks to perform that enterprise's computationally 
intensive work. The technology, scalable to millions of PCs, delivers computing power on par 
with that of supercomputers at a fraction of the cost. Companies deploy Entropia's solution to 
accelerate their time to market using the PCs they already own, dramatically increasing the ROI 
in their desktop computing and network assets. Commercial applications include critical 
Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Materials research, and Financial Services. Entropia powers 
AIDS research (<a href="http://www.fightaidsathome.org/">www.FightAIDSatHome.org</a>), economic research
(<a href="http://www.safermarkets.org/">www.SaferMarkets.org</a>), and 
mathematics research (<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">www.mersenne.org</a>) on its public Internet computing grid. Founded in 
1997, the company has offices in San Diego, California, and Cambridge, England. For more 
information visit the Entropia Web site at <a href="http://www.entropia.com/">www.entropia.com</a>.</i></p>

<blockquote>"Entropia has long recognized the importance of the Globus protocols as a basis for 
interoperable Grid computing, and our products will enable Grid users to exploit large 
pools of commodity PC's.  Because PC desktops and laptops comprise the majority of 
computing resources in the enterprise, PC Grids can vastly increase the computational 
power available to end users."
