<p class="title">INDUSTRY, RESEARCH LEADERS HAIL RELEASE OF GLOBUS TOOLKIT 3.0
</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO, January 13, 2003 - To coincide with today&#8217;s release of the 
Globus Toolkit<sup>TM </sup></font>
3.0 (GT3) -- the first implementation of emerging standards known as
the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) -- leading figures in the
business and public research sectors spoke out in support. Those quotes
are collected below.</p>

<p>The Globus Project<sup>TM</sup> issued its alpha release of GT3, a set of 
open-source software and
services whose earlier versions have transformed the way on-line
resources are shared across organizations. The release coincides with
the first GlobusWorld conference this week in San Diego. See <a href="prGT3announce03-01-13.html">prGT3announce03-01-13.html</a> for a press release describing GT3.</p>

<br><p>QUOTES FROM GLOBUS PROJECT PARTNERS</p>

<p>"The TeraGrid is an ambitious project funded by the National Science
Foundation to build a distributed terascale computing and data
infrastructure across four sites, connected by the world's fastest
network at 40 gigabits per second. The Globus Toolkit 3.0 and new, OGSA
standards-based Grid services are an essential, enabling technology for
TeraGrid. We look forward to working with the Globus Project in
mutually beneficial ways to help advance science and engineering
research through Grid computing."</p>

<p><i>Rick Stevens 
<br>Project Director, TeraGrid;  Mathematics and Computer Science Division Director, Argonne National Laboratory</i></p>

<br><p>"For the Grid to realize its full potential to dramatically increase the
effectiveness of computing in science and engineering, three high-level
milestones must be met. First, we must provide basic infrastructure to
support resource aggregation and sharing through the formation and
management of large-scale virtual organizations, and good progress has
been made toward this milestone. Second, the Grid must provide for
using and managing these resources through value-added services that
are easily integrated with the Web. Third, the Grid must provide
technology for promoting Grid resources and services to semantically
rich objects, enabling knowledge-based problem-solving environments.</p>

<p>"With the Globus Toolkit 3.0 implementation of OGSA, we have an important 
set of basic tools to achieve the second major milestone in making Grids
indispensable for increasing productivity and effectiveness of science
and engineering ­- that is, a unified and standard approach to
integrating Grids and Web Services."</p>

<p><i>William E. Johnston
<br>Senior Scientist, DOE Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and NASA Ames Research Center</i></p>

<br><p>"NEESgrid is a collaborative research environment designed to serve the
 needs of the earthquake engineering community. For NEESgrid to be a production
resource and to work across platforms, across disciplines, and at sites
throughout the U.S., it needs persistent standards and integrated
resources that can be easily accessed and used by all. That's why the
Globus Toolkit is an important component of our efforts. Using
NEESgrid, earthquake engineers can focus on conducting their
experiments and developing better approaches to reducing the impact of
natural hazards. They benefit from the resource management, security,
and software compatibility Globus provides without having to deal with
these issues directly. The Globus Toolkit provides a solid foundation
for innovation, and I am especially pleased to see the 3.0 release"</p>

<p><i>Dan Reed Director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
 and Principal Investigator for NEESgrid</i></p>

<br><p>"The
Globus Toolkit 3.0 is not only an important element of IBM's Grid
strategy, it represents a significant milestone for the computing
industry," said Tom Hawk, IBM's general manager of Grid computing.
"Over time, I believe we'll look back on 2003 as one of the key
acceleration years in Grid because of the introduction of Globus Took
Kit 3.0 and its implementation of the emerging Open Grid Services
Architecture standard. OGSA and the Globus Toolkit are as important to
the development of Grid as TCP/IP was to the development of the
Internet."
</p>

<p><i>Tom Hawk
<br>General Manager of Grid Computing, IBM</i></p>

<br><p>"The
GriPhyN and IVDGL projects are at the vanguard of science that is based
on Grid computing, and therefore we rely heavily on the Globus Toolkit
to ease management of and access to remote resources. Important physics
instruments like the Large Hadron Collider produce massive datasets
that require Grid-enabled distributed systems for real-time sharing of
data and related assets. The advent of GT3 and OGSA means these systems
can be increasingly customized, due to reliance on new standards that
define precisely what Grid services are and can do. This enables the
type of computational science that is a model for 21st century research
in science and engineeringp&gt;
</p>

<p><i>Paul Avery
<br>Principal Investigator, GriPhyN and IVDGL;  Professor Physics, the University of Florida</i></p>

<br><p>"HP
has a long tradition of supporting open source tools, as evidenced by
our development of the Linux IA-64 kernel. We support an open
standards-based environment for the Grid and expect to contribute to
the development of the Globus Toolkit both today and in the future, as
the world evolves towards planetary-scale computing."</p>

<p><i>Rich Friedrich
<br>Director, Internet Systems and Storage, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories</i>
</p>

<br><p>"Web
and Grid Service technologies offer great opportunities in Grid
computing. The new GT3 building upon these technologies is a major step
forward in bringing production-ready Grids to a larger community and a
major asset for the future Grid projects which will follow and leverage
the results of the EU DataGrid project."</p>

<p><i>Fabrizio Gagliardi
<br>Head, EU DataGrid Project</i></p>

<br><p>"As
a Grid vendor and user, we want to help our customers take advantage of
the same benefits we've reaped from grid computing. Oracle today has
key technology differentiators that make us unique. Using commodity
clusters on Linux, customers can benefit from mainframe computing at
half the cost
and achieve higher utilization. We've worked with the Globus Project to
integrate the Globus Toolkit 2.2 with the Oracle database and look
forward to continuing our work with them."</p>

<p><i>Benny Souder
<br>Vice President, Distributed Database Development, Oracle Corporation</i>
</p>

<br><p>&#8220;The
release of GT3 is an important landmark in the integration of Web and
Grid Services. In the case of OGSA-DAI, it provides essential building
blocks for enabling database interoperability in a Grid environment.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Dave Pearson 
<br>Program Manager, OGSA Database Access and Integration (DAI) Working Group</i></p>


<br><p>"Over
the past year, we have seen commercial acceptance of Grid computing
continue to grow among our clients as enterprises such as Bristol-Myers
Squibb, JPMorgan Chase and others realize its compelling business
value. As part of our commitment to OGSA, Platform will continue to
support Globus GT2 and ensure that future releases of Platform products
and solutions are GT3 and OGSA-compliant, including Platform Globus."</p>

<p><i>Ian Baird
<br>Chief Business Architect, Platform Computing Inc. and GGF Steering Committee Board Member</i></p>

<br><p>"The
Globus Toolkit continues to be the key to open, interoperable grids. I
am excited to see GT3's release as it represents a major step forward
in incorporating web services technologies with Globus, and provides a
convenient way to integrate desktop grids such as Entropia's DCGrid
into larger enterprise and cross-enterprise grids."</p>


<p><i>Andrew Chien
<br>Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Entropia</i></p>


<br><p>"SGI
congratulates the Globus Project on the release of GT3. We believe that
it represents a major leap forward in bringing functionality to the
Grid. SGI is committed to ongoing support of the Globus Tool Kit 3 and
OGSA and will soon begin the process of validating GT3 on its newly
released Altix
3000 family of servers and superclusters - the world's scalable
machines for LINUX."</p>

<p><i>Walter Stewart
<br>Silicon Graphics, Inc.
<br>Director of Business Development, SGI Canada
<br>Global Coordinator, SGI Grid Strategy</i></p>

<br><p>"The
OGSA standard is a breakthrough for the wide acceptance of Grid
computing, ranging from Grid users and resource providers to Grid and
Web Service developers. OGSA is especially important for our thousands
of Sun customers who, during the past two years, have built grids
within their enterprise or university campus. Now, with OGSA, it is
much easier for them to enhance their grids by integrating Sun Grid
Engine and the Grid Engine Portal with additional functionality - like
the ones provided by GT3."</p>

<p><i>Wolfgang Gentzsch
<br>Director of Grid Computing, Sun Microsystems</i></p>


<br><p>"Version 3.0 of the Globus Toolkit is an important milestone for the 
    Globus Project and for the Grid computing community. Cray delivers the 
    ultimate tools 
    for high performance computing, and version 3.0 of the Globus Toolkit will 
    allow our customers to make these powerful systems more broadly accessible.
