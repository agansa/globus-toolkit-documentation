<p class="title">GlobusWorld Takes Grid Computing to Another Level</p>

<i>Inaugural conference on the Globus Toolkit, the open source solution for the Grid</i></p> 

<p>The leading minds of Grid computing met 
at the first GlobusWorld conference in San Diego, January 13-17, 
2003.  Attendees  benefited from tutorials, talks on experiences and 
future directions, and demonstrations of the Globus Toolkit (TM), a 
collection of open-source software and libraries that is transforming the 
way on-line resources are shared across organizations.</p>

<p><i>Over 450 GlobusWORLD attendees came from 25 countries 
to learn about the latest developments in Globus Toolkit-based Grid computing.

<p>The Globus Toolkit (GT) is central to hundreds of Grid deployments for 
science and engineering worldwide, and it is increasingly important to 
corporate strategies for overcoming obstacles to collaboration.  The Globus 
Project (TM) is now leading the effort to define the Open Grid Services 
Architecture (OGSA), a standard on which next-generation Grid applications 
will be based.  GlobusWorld will highlight current applications of GT 2.2 
and the OGSA-based GT3, which is nearing its alpha release.</p>

<p>"GlobusWorld offers an unequaled chance for system developers and decision 
makers to immerse themselves in the technology driving the Grid," said Ian 
Foster, associate division director for mathematics and computer science at 
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and professor of computer science at the 
University of Chicago.  The Globus Project is led by Foster, Carl Kesselman 
(professor of computer science at the University of Southern California 
(USC) and director of the USC Information Sciences Institute's Center for 
Grid Technologies) and Steve Tuecke (lead architect of the ANL Distributed 
Systems Laboratory).</p><p>"This conference is a coming of age for the Globus 
Toolkit as a de facto 
standard for the Grid, and a coming out party for the OGSA standards-based 
GT3 that -- while still in development -- is the subject of intense 
interest from our user community," said Kesselman.  The event program is at 
<a href="http://www.globusworld.org/">http://www.globusworld.org</a>.</p>

<p><i>Grid Futures panelists (L-R) were Ahmar Abbas (Grid Technology Partners),
William Fellows (the 451), Rick Stevens (Argonne), Ian Foster (GlobusWorld 
Co-Chair, panel moderator), and Carl Kesselman (GlobusWorld Co-Chair).</i></p>

<p>The conference  featured a keynote address by Peter Freeman, assistant 
director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) for computer and 
information science and engineering.  NSF is planning a program in 
"cyberinfrastructure" to serve scientific and engineering research.  "Grid 
computing -- and the software that enables it -- is absolutely essential to 
building a cyberinfrastructure that will revolutionize science and 
engineering," said Freeman.  "The Globus Toolkit community is at the 
forefront of these efforts and is to be congratulated and encouraged."</p>

<p>Another keynote speaker was Miron Livny, professor of computer science at 
the University of Wisconsin, who leads development of the popular Condor 
software.  "GlobusWorld will give the scientific community a unique 
opportunity to 'take stock' of the impact that the Globus Toolkit has had 
so far on their computing infrastructure," said Livny.  "The conference 
will also set the stage for the next phase of research and development 
activities to be fueled by the new capabilities offered by the next 
generation of the Globus Toolkit."</p>

<p>GlobusWorld also boasts speakers from leading IT companies, plus tutorials 
and workshops by developers and practitioners.  IBM, which is the exclusive 
GlobusWorld "ambassador sponsor," has committed significant resources to 
GT-based Grid offerings.  Additional sponsors include Avaki, CapitalOne 
Financial Services, Ceyba, the California Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology (Cal-IT2), Entropia, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, 
Oracle, Platform Computing, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), 
Silicon Graphics, Inc., Storage Computer Corp., Sun Microsystems, and Tabor 
Communications.  Oracle's recently released Grid Developer's Kit includes 
and is based on the Globus Toolkit, and the other commercial sponsors have 
made similar commitments to using the Globus Project' software and services.</p>

<br><p><b>About the Globus Project</b></p>
<bt>The Globus Project conducts research and development to create the 
fundamental technologies behind the "Grid," which lets people share 
computing power, databases, and other tools securely online across 
corporate, institutional, and geographic boundaries without sacrificing 
local autonomy. The project's open source Globus Toolkit includes software 
services and libraries for resource monitoring, discovery, and management, 
plus security and file management.  The toolkit is central to science and 
engineering projects that total nearly a half-billion dollars 
internationally, and it is the substrate on which leading IT companies are 
building significant commercial Grid products. The Globus Toolkit 2.0 
received a 2002 R&amp;D 100 Award from R&amp;D Magazine, which further honored the 
toolkit as 2002's "Most Promising New Technology." The Globus Project is 
based at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Southern 
California's Information Sciences Institute. For more information, see

<p>Development of GT3 is sponsored primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy
through its Office of Science's Mathematical, Information and Computational
Sciences Division and by IBM.</p>
