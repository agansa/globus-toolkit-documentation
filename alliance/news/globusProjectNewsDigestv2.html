<p><b>2.	 Feature Story</b></p>

<p><b>SCIDAC NATIONAL FUSION COLLABORATORY PROJECT SEES GAINS WITH GLOBUS TOOLKIT </b></p>

<p>Magnetic fusion energy research is getting a boost from deployment 
of the Globus
Toolkit TM. Project leaders hope the popular toolkit’s Grid software
and services will let them collaborate better -- and in different ways
-- with partners across the U.S. and overseas.</p>


<p>The National Fusion Collaboratory is funded by the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s SciDAC program to create
and deploy collaborative software tools for magnetic fusion research.
The FusionGrid project seeks to promote more efficient use of
experimental facilities and more effective integration of experiment,
theory, and modeling.</p>

<p>David Schissel is
a FusionGrid principal investigator from General Atomics, where he
manages the Data Analysis Applications group, part of the Theory and
Advanced Computing division. “We asked ourselves, ‘How can a
distributed community like ours make collaboration more fruitful?’”,
said Schissel. Through contact with Rick Stevens, he became aware of
new types of tools being created in the Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL) Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) division, which Stevens
directs.</p> 

<p>MCS is home to the Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSL) 
-- a lead partner in the Globus Project
-- and the Futures Laboratory (FL), which develops advanced
visualization technologies that are also proving useful to fusion
researchers. The discussions with ANL led to a successful proposal for
three years of SciDAC funding that began in late 2001. The Globus
Project's Ian Foster and Kate Keahey are on the FusionGrid team for the
DSL, as are Stevens and Mike Papka for the FL, along with others from
MIT, the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, Princeton University, and the University of Utah.</p>

<p>“Our users
are geographically distributed across the country,” he said, “but
experimental data are centralized at those three sites. To begin, we’re
using the Globus Toolkit for remote computation -- including secure
data access -- but our eventual goal is to be able to perform the
majority of experimental data analysis remotely.” Each plasma exists
for only about 10 seconds, with 15 to 20 minutes between plasmas, which
presents a very intense data-analysis period. Grid computing can
deliver more-detailed and immediate feedback about the plasma behavior,
letting fusion scientists make adjustments on the fly, yielding much
more-productive experiments. </p> 

<p>“What if
you did a day of 30 plasmas but couldn't analyze resulting data until
the following week?”, said Schissel. “That’s not an efficient use of
experimental time. The Grid way has the potential to be a much better
use of time in terms of equipment and people.” </p>

<p>Using the
Globus Toolkit combined with visualization tools from the Futures Lab
and other project members, fusion scientists at their home institutions
can retrieve and analyze remote data during experiments in progress,
then give tokamak operators feedback in time to shape the next plasma
run.</p>

<p>The 44th Annual
meeting of the Division of Plasma Physics during the week before SC02
brings together over 1,000 fusion energy scientists. The meeting will
feature two invited presentations of results from FusionGrid’s remote
computing capability and remote visualization tools, which will also be
demonstrated there.</p> 

<p>“We're
excited that, within one year of start-up, FusionGrid is producing
results useful to the fusion community," said Kate Keahey of Argonne
National Laboratory, a Globus Project member of the FusionGrid team.
"Not every site can afford its own cluster or the manpower to maintain
one, so the good news is that if you have Grids, you don't have to.”</p>

<p>MDSPlus (www.mdsplus.org <http:>)
is the most widely used software for managing magnetic-fusion
experimental data. It is currently installed at over 30 sites on four
continents. The FusionGrid project has “Globusized” the MDSPlus tools,
which were developed ten years ago by MIT, the Center for Nuclear
Research in Padua, Italy, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. </http:></p>

<p>FusionGrid
principals hope to bring experimentalists and theorists closer together
by using the Grid-enabled MDSPlus as a common platform for organized
data storage, something the theoretical community has lacked previously.</p> 

<p>"If I'm
working at Princeton and have a computer code there, before I would
have brought the code home and it would then have to be maintained at
two sites. With Grids, we can share code across 20 to 30 sites,” said
Schissel. “I might not have access to a large Beowulf cluster at my
home institution. With the Globus Toolkit’s authentication and
authorization services, we’re making progress.</p>

<p>Another program, TRANSP from Princeton, has been used since the mid 1980s for data analysis and simulation.  
TRANSP runs on Linux clusters, and a Globus Toolkit-enhanced version is now being demonstrated at scientific 
meetings and is producing scientific results that have been presented at the 19th International Atomic Energy Agency 
Fusion Energy Conference, in addition to the national plasma physics meeting demos and presentations, according to 
Schissel.  Now they’re working on NIMROD, a tool that generates 3D macroscopic models of fusion plasmas. </p>


<p>“Our funders ask us to identify positive results that FusionGrid research is having for scientists,” he said.  
“The Grid versions of TRANSP and MDSPlus are good examples.  So far the overhead is a bit high, though, 
because the ratio of programmers to scientists is too high.  We anticipate that -- as Grid technology matures and 
fusion scientists gain experience with it -- in time, this ratio will decrease and the entire field will see great benefits.”</p>


<p>Schissel will describe FusionGrid during presentations at the upcoming SC02 conference in Baltimore, 
November 16-22.  He will appear at booths hosted by SciDAC, ANL, the University of Utah, and the 
University of California at Berkeley.</p>
