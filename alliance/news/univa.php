<h1 class="first">We Welcome Univa Corporation to the Globus Community</h1>

<p>It is our pleasure to welcome a new member to the Globus community. 
Univa Corporation (<a href="http://www.univa.com/">www.univa.com</a>) is a company that is (to quote their Web 
site) "devoted to developing and supporting commercial Grid solutions based 
on Globus software."</p>

<p>We take this opportunity to emphasize the Globus Alliance's ongoing 
commitment to open source software and its open source community. All Globus 
software is developed by a talented developer community, distributed under a 
liberal open source license, and applied by users around the world.</p>

<p>Univa engineers are already contributing substantially to the development 
and testing of the upcoming Globus Toolkit version 4. We hope to see this 
newest member of the Globus community play an important role in evolving 
Globus software into an increasingly mature open source Grid technology.</p>
