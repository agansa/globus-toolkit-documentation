<h1>What's Next From IBM: Aa Interview with Surjit Chana</h1>

<p>In anticipation of SC2001, HPCwire recently spoke with Surjit Chana, IBM's 
vice president for high performance computing. In the following interview,
Mr. Chana talks about the latest developments at IBM and the future of HPC.</p>

<p>HPCwire: You're new to the HPC segment, what did you previously do within IBM?</p>
	
<p>CHANA: I started my IBM career at the IBM Scientific Center in Winchester, UK
and have now been with IBM for 16 years - 7 years in Europe and 9 in the US. I
have held various product development, sales, marketing and business partner
roles in software and hardware. I hold software patents relative to work I
conducted on IBM Middleware products.  My educational background is Physics
from the University of Surrey, UK.</p>
	
<p>HPCwire: What exactly is your role and responsibilities within the HPC group?</p>

<p>CHANA: I am now the IBM VP for High Performance Computing with responsibility
for driving IBM product development, research, sales and marketing strategies
relative to HPC.</p>
 
<p>HPCwire: Is this a new position for the HPC segment?</p>
 
<p>CHANA: Yes, we are placing greater emphasis and investments on HPC and are
committed to our customers and partners for the long term.</p>
 
<p>HPCwire: What would you like to accomplish over the next 12 months?</p>
 
<p>CHANA: I would like to establish IBM as the best partner for Scientific and
Technical customers and extend IBM's leadership in the HPC marketplace. There
are four parts to this : Firstly, I am focused on producing the best products
for the technical market; secondly leveraging IBM's investment in Research to
better help and support the scientific and technical community; third, we are
partnering more with the key application providers in this space - the ISV's
that develop the applications that are critical to this community and finally
we are leveraging the breadth and depth of IBM to better support our
customers. This include leveraging IBM Global Services, leveraging our
industry-aligned sales teams, IBM Global Financing and IBM Software group to
provide the best compilers and software support for the HPC market place.</p>
	
<p>HPCwire: The HP-Compaq merger will create a company only slightly smaller than
IBM itself.  How is this merger likely to effect the HPC sector?  What, if
anything, will IBM do to maintain its market share?</p>

<p>CHANA: The announcement as you know as attracted much comment from the
Industry overall - much of it questioning the reasons for the merger. I will
not try to repeat that discussion here. The main comment I would make is that
IF the merger goes through its going to take a while for the new HP to focus
on customers and I am not sure how much focus the combined company will have
on the technical market - especially given the announcement Compaq had already
made on the Alpha technology. What will not change is that the vendor that
provides a robust, scalable architecture, competitive price/performance
products, and key partnerships with leading application providers will be in
the best position to provide value and thought leadership to the scientific
and technical community. IBM is committed to doing that and is the most stable
and reliable partner given what's going on in the HPC marketplace.</p>

<p>HPCwire: What is happening within IBM in the high performance computing arena?</p>
	
<p>CHANA: Today, IBM is the marketshare leader in the high-end Capability segment
of HPC. In two years, we intend to become the marketshare leader across the
total HPC server market. IBM is delivering new products to HPC customers. We
recently announced new high-end POWER4 servers, called the IBM eServer p690
which have demonstrated excellent performance on key benchmarks and HPC
workloads.  As part of the p690 product, we also have a high-memory bandwidth
feature that yields additional performance benefits on the right kinds of
applications.  Work continues on clustering software and we will be supporting
clusters of p690's as well as SP switch-attached p690's early next year.</p>
	
<p>IBM Research is working on many HPC fronts, including highly scalable systems,
dense packaging, scalable graphics engine, advanced mathematics solvers, Grid
technologies, Life Sciences and a host of other efforts that will find their
way into new products over the coming months and years. The Blue Gene project
for example is focused on building a massively parallel computer, to be
applied to the study of biomolecular phenomena such as protein folding. The
project has two main goals: to advance our understanding of the mechanisms
behind protein folding via large-scale simulation, and to explore novel ideas
in massively parallel machine architecture and software.  Making scientific
investments like Blue Gene gives us enormous opportunity to deliver advanced
technology to customers that has been derived from Research.</p>

<p>We also want to build upon our relationships with ISVs that serve the HPC
market, and to develop new relationships with key ISVs with whom we now do
little or no business.  Having the support of the key ISVs is critical for
success in the Enterprise, Divisional and Departmental segments where packaged
applications are prevalent.</p>
	
<p>And we will certainly leverage other parts of IBM to deliver the best HPC
solutions in our quest to be the marketshare leader.  Very good work is coming
out of the Linux Technology Center, our compiler group, the high-speed
interconnect development team, tools groups and many others. The Life Sciences
organization is making great strides to make IBM number one in that field.
And IBM Global Services continues to build skills and enhance their
HPC-focused practices which help us win bids and convince customers to switch
from competition to IBM.</p>

<p>HPCwire: IBM is committed to the development of the Grid.  What will the Grid
look like in 10 years?  Is the Grid really comparable to the Net in the
1990's, as some analysts have claimed?  How will it impact HPC in scientific
research?  Will it prove important to the general computer user, or is it
mainly significant to high performance computing?</p>

<p>CHANA: IBM plans to play a leadership role in Grid activities.  Our vision of
grid computing is based on networks already in use by NASA and in universities
and research labs that link hundreds or thousands of nodes, or machines, which
may be scattered around the world. The grids focus the computers' combined
power on a single task.   Governments in Britain and The Netherlands recently
selected IBM to help set up national computing grids for scientific research.
And we have established a technology unit within IBM, managed by David Turek,
VP Emerging Technologies, that pulls together IBM's hardware, software,
networking and research capabilities to drive the Grid.</p>

<p>Grids, like Linux and the Internet, will eventually grow beyond the academic
world and become an important business platform. Grid protocols could provide
a key platform for e-sourcing which is an initiative inside IBM to sell and
deliver computing resources as a utility-like service over the Internet.
Already, Labs in the US are using Grids to develop and test e-sourcing in
commercial Grid environments. We can expect commercial and HPC customers to
use the Grid to do resource aggregation which treats the organizations compute
infrastructure as one computer when the workload demands it.  Companies will
also use Grid to do database sharing. Examples include researchers working on
large volumes of biological data from many sources, engineers working on large
scale structural designs, and financial firms leveraging massive amounts of
data to develop and price financial instruments.</p>

<p>HPCwire: What can you tell us about Project eLiza?  What is the status of its
development?  What other major new technologies is IBM developing that will
affect HPC?</p>

<p>CHANA: Project eLiza is the effort by IBM to build self-optimizing, managing
and healing systems which can adapt to their environment with no human
intervention.  Customers have told us that their biggest concern is the
growing shortage of IT skills to help with the increasingly complex systems.
We believe future servers will be based on self-managing systems, that will
self-optimize, self-heal, self-configure and self-protect with minimal
intervention.  This will help us dramatically reduce the cost and complexity
for every customer, regardless of size.</p>
	
<p>We are already delivering self-managing technologies to our customers.
Examples include the Intelligent Resource Director, which automatically
allocates resources for multiple jobs according to demand; eServer clustering,
which updates software and manages workloads across massive clusters with a
single operation; and Chipkill technology, which is used in our mainframes to
virtually eliminate memory failures, and is now available on some of our Unix
systems including p690.</p>

<p>Our Advanced e-business Council, composed of high-level IBM developers,
researchers, and customers is defining a Heterogeneous Workload Manager that
will handle as many as 64 classes of work, spanning the entire network rather
than just a single server. It will track each job throughout the network, and
automatically tune the network and operating system to reduce delays.  We are
working in other areas as well to make self management a reality. Project
Oceano which is focused on scalable cluster management, is a highly
integrated, parallel system that monitors everything from compute and network
resource use to application workload and database performance, and
automatically allocates compute resources to various workloads.
Self-management is the goal in other areas as well. Distributed server
management is an area where we want to establish wireless management of
anything from anywhere. And as stated before, we will derive benefits from the
Blue Gene project to develop truly self-healing systems.</p>

<p>HPCwire: What are the implications of the latest IBM server announcement of
eServer p690 (also known as Regatta)?</p>

<p>CHANA: It was announced on 4 Oct '01 and clearly is a high performance
computer setting new standards in performance, architecture, and technology
for the demanding HPC customers.   It is offered as an SMP system with a
1.3GHz POWER4 processor, that is an impressive supercomputer without requiring
clustering.  This product is the beginning of IBM's new initiative in the
divisional/enterprise SMP market, which will be continued in succeeding
product generations. We also announced an HPC feature, p690 HPC, specifically
for  application workloads that require high memory bandwidth for improved
performance and throughput through a dedicated L2 cache. Several applications
that may benefit include CAE crash and structures, CFD, petroleum reservoir
modeling, ocean modeling, and life sciences.  We expect customers could see up
to 30-45% increased performance with this new HPC computer.  IBM is continuing
our support of the cluster supercomputing market that it created with the IBM
SP systems. The p690 will be supported as an "SP node" in the first half of
next year, and around the middle of next year we will announce POWER4-based
low-end and mid-range systems that will also be SP-compatible. These nodes
will offer less SMP capability in exchange for a lower price per CPU, and will
be of interest to customers who can effectively use clusters of small nodes.</p>

<p>HPCwire: Silicon chips based on current design techniques may be approaching
their speed limit.  Several new methods of designing chips have been proposed.
Which do you feel is the most promising, and why?  What will be the dominant
architecture in 20 years?</p>

<p>CHANA: IBM pioneered using copper wiring to replace aluminum as it provides
lesser resistance than aluminum and along with increased speed.  And copper
chips are smaller, denser and faster which translates into superior
performance to our customers.  Along with copper wiring, we also introduced
silicon-on-insulator chips, a new insulating layer in the silicon that boosts
performance by 20-30% beyond the use of copper alone.   It also reduces power
requirements by as much as two-thirds.  Other technologies that offer promise
are shielded copper circuits that produce low-k dielectric condition that
reduces electrical "crosstalk" resulting in improved performance, and strained
silicon anchored on silicon germanium which speeds up the flow of electrons.
Technology will continue to improve with no end in sight. Only a few companies
will be able to sustain the investments necessary  to keep up with the pace of
increasing customer requirements.   IBM's Research team continues to work on
exciting HPC developments and joint customer research projects. Services will
continue to grow in importance with our customers.</p>
	
<p>HPCwire: Linux has made great strides in the past few years.  What's the next
step? Has the economic slowdown effected IBM's Linux push?</p>
	
<p>CHANA: Unix systems are still at the heart of most HPC situations so we
continue to be committed to AIX, AIX clusters, and advanced RISC technology
roadmap. But Linux is quickly evolving and IBM is committed to have Linux
enabled on all our platforms.  And IBM is committed to Linux Clusters using
Intel processors and has sold and installed 10's of millions of clusters
already this year.  We are leveraging what we learned in SP clusters in the
system management of Linux Clusters.  The week of SC01 we will be announcing
an easy-to-order, pre-installed eServer Linux Cluster utilizing IBM's xSeries
technology.</p>
	
<p>This is an exciting time to be in the HPC market.  I look forward to seeing
you all at SC01.</p>
