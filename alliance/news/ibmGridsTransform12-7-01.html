<h1>Grids Will Transform Computing, Predicts IBM Senior Exec</h1>
 
 <p>New York, NY -- A senior IBM executive told a conference of more than 100 
  leading management consulting professionals that the emerging technology of 
  grid computing will transform their industry, and business in general.</p> 

 <p>Irving Wladawsky-Berger, IBM Server Group Vice President of Technology and 
  Strategy, said that grid computing will enable unprecedented levels of 
  collaboration between businesses by enabling them to share computing 
  resources 
  -- such as applications, data and computing power -- allowing individuals to 
  access computing "on tap" from any location. This will lead to a more 
  advanced 
  computing model based on Internet technologies and open standards, allowing 
  companies to pool resources, reduce fixed IT costs through utility, build 
  more 
  resilient self-managing infrastructure and create secure virtual 
  organizations.</p>

  <p>Addressing Kennedy Information's Consulting Summit 3.0 in New York City, 
  Wladawsky-Berger said, "Each stage of the Internet's evolution has been 
  cumulative. Where the Internet today is a vast repository of content that 
  enabled e-business, the next major stage will leverage Grid computing -- 
  turning the Internet itself into a computing platform. Think back to 
  1994-95. 
  The Web was on the horizon and clients were looking for focused projects to 
  get their feet wet. This is the same type of opportunity."</p>

  <p>The challenges of Grid computing, says Wladawsky-Berger, include:</p> 

  <p>- Building an open infrastructure. Just as the original Internet was built 
  on 
  commonly accepted, open standards, open Grid computing protocols will allow 
  customers to distribute computing resources broadly and efficiently.</p> 

  <p>- Incorporating self-managing technologies. A grid computing system will 
  have 
  to manage itself in order to deal with its complexity, and the only way to 
  do 
  that is to make it more "autonomic," i.e., more self-managing.</p> 

  <p>- Looking to utility-like access for some resources. People have to gain 
  access to the infrastructure, which requires what many in the industry are 
  calling e-sourcing.</p> 

  <p>"Grid computing is in some ways like the World Wide Web. The Web provides 
  access to a world of content over the Internet through open standards that 
  let 
  the casual user connect without having to know where the resource is 
  located." 
  added Wladawsky-Berger. "Just as the user looks at the Internet and sees 
  content via the World Wide Web, the user looking at a Grid sees essentially 
  one, large virtual computer built on open protocols with everything shared 
  -- 
  applications, data, processing power, storage, etc. all through the 
  Internet."</p> 

<p>"Service providers will have to adapt as computing becomes available over a 
  grid," Wladawsky-Berger said. "We believe that one of the chief ways that 
  customers will access the infrastructure is through e-business-on-demand, 
  the 
  ability to simply plug into an IT utility for the computing resources you 
  need 
  -- either all your resources, or to cover peak demand."</p> 

p>"As the Internet emerges in this more powerful form, businesses will look to 
 the consulting industry to understand the opportunity of Grid computing. 
  Today 
  that may be lower costs through resource sharing within or between 
  organizations. Next year customers might respond to the time to market 
  advantage that will be offered through e-business-on-demand services. 
  Regardless of the economic winds, the combination of market demand, 
  technology 
  and open standards will deliver a computing platform with near-limitless 
  resources available anywhere to anyone authorized to use them."</p>
