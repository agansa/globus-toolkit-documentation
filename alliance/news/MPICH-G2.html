<p class="title">Announcing MPICH-G2</p>

 <i>Redesigned Grid-enabled MPI Implementation Now Available</i>

<p>September 14, 2000</p>

<p>Northern Illinois University and Argonne National Laboratory are pleased to announce
    the release of MPICH-G2, a grid-enabled implementation of the MPI v1.1 standard. MPI
    (Message Passing Interface) is a widely-used standard for writing message-passing
    programs. The message passing technique is frequently used in applications run on
    massively parallel supercomputers or workstation clusters. MPICH-G2 allows MPI
    applications to be run on multiple machines, including machines of different architectures
    that utilize different scheduling systems.</p>

<p>MPICH-G2 uses services provided by the Globus Toolkit to coordinate and manage work on
    multiple computer systems. MPICH-G2 automatically converts data in messages sent between
    machines of different architectures and supports multi-protocol communication by
    automatically selecting TCP for inter-machine messaging and vendor-supplied MPI (where
    available) for intra-machine messaging.</p>


<p>MPICH-G2 represents a complete re-design of the earlier grid-enabled implementation of
    MPI, MPICH-G. MPICH-G2 is implemented as a "device" within the popular MPICH
    libary, developed and distributed by Bill Gropp and Ewing (Rusty) Lusk of the Mathematics
    and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

<p>For additional information about MPICH-G2 (including download details), see <a href="http://www.hpclab.niu.edu/mpi/">http://www.hpclab.niu.edu/mpi/</a>.

<p class="title">Release 1.1.4 of the Globus Toolkit Supports MPICH-G2</p>

<p>MPICH-G2, the Grid-enabled MPI implementation, requires an interim release of the
    Globus Toolkit: release 1.1.4. This release is now available from the Globus website at <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/</a>.</p>

<p>Globus installations prior to 1.1.3 should be upgraded to 1.1.4 in order to use
    MPICH-G2. Users of release 1.1.3 of the Globus Toolkit who wish to use MPICH-G2 should
    obtain the 1.1.4 release and re-install their client tools and development libraries.
    Sites with existing 1.1.3 servers do not need to redeploy Globus services to use MPICH-G2.
    (In most cases, this means that sites with release 1.1.3 already running can build the
    1.1.4 release, run globus-install, and not run globus-local-deploy on individual systems.)
