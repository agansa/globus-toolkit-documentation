<p class="title">Argonne plays key role in new Distributed Terascale Facility Project</p>

<p>The world's most powerful computational infrastructure is being built  by 
NSF's Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI). Research 
institutions NCSA, SDSC, Argonne, and Caltech will work in conjunction with IBM, Intel Corporation, and Qwest Communications, Myricom, Sun Microsystems, and 
Oracle 
Corporation. Utilizing distributed systems based on Globus Grid
technology, the partnership will set up and integrate new Linux clusters to supply 
a total of 11.6 teraflops of computing power in addition to the 2 existing clusters 
at NCSA, for the development of large scale data base applications.</p>

    
<p>Globus, the toolkit for programming grid computing systems and
the basic software infrastructure for systems that integrate
geographically distributed computational and information resources, along
with a message-passing interface (MPICH-G2) and a science toolkit (CACTUS)
will be used to coordinate computational activity across the 4 site clusters.</p>
