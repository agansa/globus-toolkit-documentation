<p class="title"> News from the Globus Alliance</p>
FOR IMMEDIATE USE

<p align="center"><b>GLOBUS ALLIANCE ESTABLISHED AS INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM TO
ADVANCE GLOBUS GRID SOFTWARE</b></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Argonne, the Information Sciences Institute and the University of Chicago are joined by the University of Edinburgh and the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology</i></b></p>

<p>CHICAGO, September 2, 2003 -- By adding members from Scotland and Sweden, 
the Globus Project today transformed itself into the &#8220;Globus Alliance.
&#8221;  Like the original Globus Project, the Globus Alliance is a tightly 
integrated consortium dedicated to collaborative design, development, testing,
 and support of the open source Globus Toolkit<sup>®</sup>, the de facto 
standard Grid software.</p>

<p> The Globus Project was established in 1995 by the U.S. Argonne National 
Laboratory, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
Institute (ISI) and the University of Chicago (UofC). New Globus Alliance 
partners are the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and the Swedish Center 
for Parallel Computers (PDC), which contribute database-integration and 
security expertise, respectively.  In addition, a new Academic Affiliates 
program with participation from Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the U.S. recognizes 
major contributions to the Globus Toolkit by key members of the academic and 
research communities, which gain a formal voice in Globus Alliance governance
 with the creation of a new advisory council.</p>


<p>&#8220;We are delighted to announce this transition to the Globus Alliance, 
with its two new partners and Affiliates program,&#8221; said Ian Foster, 
member of the new Globus Alliance governing board, associate director of 
Argonne&#8217;s Mathematics and Computer Science division and professor in the
 UofC Computer Science department. &#8220;The Edinburgh Parallel Computing 
Center (EPCC)and PDC provide a much-needed European dimension to the Globus
virtual organization.  This important step recognizes the international scope
of the Globus community, brings exciting new technical capabilities, and
expands the set of people who, like us, live and breathe Globus technologies.
&#8221;</p>

<p>The Globus Toolkit provides key enabling software and services that let
 people share computing power, databases, and other tools securely online
 across corporate, institutional, and geographic boundaries without 
sacrificing local autonomy. It has been deployed broadly worldwide for both
 science and industry and has developed a strong community of contributors 
and users. </p>

<p>The Globus Alliance&#8217;s new governing board is structured to continue
 this tradition of community engagement and careful design.  In addition to 
Foster, members include Malcolm Atkinson and Mark Parsons of Edinburgh and
 Olle Mulmo and Lennart Johnsson at PDC, who join longtime Globus participants
 Carl Kesselman and  Karl Czajkowski of ISI and Steven Tuecke of Argonne. This 
board takes on ultimate responsibility for Globus Toolkit design and 
governance.></p>

<p>EPCC developers and staff from the National e-Science Centre at Edinburgh 
    play a leading role in 
    the Global Grid Forum Database Access and Integration Services (DAIS) 
    working group that is writing specifications for this important Grid area. 
    EPCC are the primary implementers of a reference implementation, OGSA-DAI, 
    work funded by the UK e-Science Grid Core Programme. Founded in 1990, and 
    with more than 60 staff, EPCC has a long history of working with industry 
    and public bodies in collaborative projects at the leading edge of 
    computational research and development.</p>

<p><a name="OLE_LINK1">&#8220;The Globus Alliance is an excellent development,
  allowing us to build on   Edinburgh&#8217;s existing collaboration with the 
  Globus team,&#8221; said Professor Atkinson, director of the National 
  e-Science Centre and chief architect of  the OGSA-DAI Project. &#8220;The 
  Alliance&#8217;s combined skills will significantly 
    enhance our capacity to design, develop and deploy this vital distributed 
    system infrastructure. We are happy to share responsibility for future 
    progress of the Globus Toolkit.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Founded in 1989, PDC is the main centre for high-performance computing and 
    visualization for the Swedish academic community. It has a record of 
    successful early adoption of new technology for high-end users and 
    extensive experience in developing and 
    deploying security solutions and system administration tools in open 
    environments, and a record of successful contributions to the Open Source 
    community<span style="color: black;">. It co-founded the European Grid 
    Support Centre and the Nordic Grid Consortium, and is an active body in 
    the European grid research community.</p>


<p>&#8220;The Globus Alliance builds on the world wide success of the Globus 
project and provides improved opportunities for regional and local influence
on requirements and solutions for common Grid software components,&#8221; said 
Lennart Johnsson</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, director of PDC and 
 Professor of Numerical Analysis and Computer Science at the Royal Institute 
of Technology. &#8220;We are convinced that the Globus Alliance effort will 
improve the development of the Globus Toolkit, and allow for richer feature 
sets.&#8221;</p>


<p>U.S. partners in the 
   Globus Alliance continue to be funded by federal sponsors such as the 
   Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NASA and the Defense 
   Advanced Research Projects Agency. Industry sponsors include IBM and 
   Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>&#8220;The interest and use of Grids has grown dramatically over the past 
    two years&#8221; said Carl Kesselman, director of the Center for Grid 
    Technology at ISI. &#8220;The time is 
    right to expand the partnership to embrace new expertise and to advance 
    Globus as a responsive, high-quality open source community for Grid 
    infrastructure.&#8221; </p>

<p>The new Globus Academic Affiliates program recognizes major contributions 
    to the Globus Toolkit by other organizations, as 
    contributors or users. The first affiliates are, in Europe, CERN
    of Switzerland, the lead partner of the EU DataGrid project, the 
    Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center of Poland, 
    the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein 
    Institute) of Germany, and Imperial College of the UK; 
    in Asia Pacific, Monash University in Australia, Tokyo Institute of 
    Technology, and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 
    Technology&#8217;s Grid Technology and Research Center in Japan; and in 
    the U.S., the University of Wisconsin&#8217;s Condor group, Lawrence 
    Berkeley National  Laboratory, the National Center for Supercomputing 
    Applications, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the Texas Advanced 
    Computing Center at the University of Texas, Indiana University, Northern 
    Illinois University, Louisiana State 
    University, and the University of California at Santa Barbara.</p>
