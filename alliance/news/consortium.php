<h1 class="first">Globus Alliance Welcomes Formation of Consortium</h1>


<p>January 25, 2005</p>

<p>HP, IBM, Intel, and Sun Microsystems recently announced the formation of the 
<a href="http://www.globusconsortium.com/">Globus Consortium</a>,  a new 
industry group dedicated to advancing the development 
and adoption of the Globus Toolkit  in commercial settings. The Globus 
Consortium is not a standards body. It will complement the  work of Grid 
standards bodies, such as the Global Grid Forum (GGF), by driving the open 
source implementation of standards that support enterprise Grid implementations.</p>
