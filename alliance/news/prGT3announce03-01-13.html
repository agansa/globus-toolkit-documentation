<p class="title">GLOBUS TOOLKIT 3.0 DELIVERS GRID STANDARDS<br>Alpha version of popular open source Grid software points the way to a new 
generation of Grid services and applications</p>
 
  
<p>SAN DIEGO, January 13, 2003 -- Grid computing takes a major step forward 
today with the first implementation of emerging standards known as the Open 
Grid Services Architecture (OGSA).  The Globus Project<sup>TM</sup> issued its 
alpha release of the Globus Toolkit 3.0 (GT3), a set of open-source 
software and services whose earlier versions have transformed the way 
on-line resources are shared across organizations. 

<p>GT3&#8217;s release, which coincides with the first GlobusWorld conference this week in San Diego (<a href="http://www.globusworld.org/">
http://www.globusworld.org</a>), is the result of the past 
year&#8217;s effort toward defining specifications for Grid services that 
extend standard Web services.  The OGSA-based alpha version builds on prior 
releases of the Globus Toolkit, which is central to hundreds of science and 
engineering projects on the Grid.</p>

<p>The Globus Project also announced that other leading Grid participants are 
committing to use of GT3 and OGSA.  Companies include Avaki, Cray, 
Entropia, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle, Platform Computing, Silicon 
Graphics, Inc.,  Sun Microsystems, and Veridian.  Research projects include 
FusionGrid, TeraGrid, the Department of Energy Science Grid, the Grid 
Physics Network (GriPhyN), the Network for Earthquake Engineering 
Simulation, the International Virtual Data Grid Laboratory, and the 
National Science Foundation Middleware Initiative.  A collection of quotes 
about GT3 by these partners is at 
<a href="prGT3quotes03-01-13.html">prGT3quotes03-01-13.html</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re enthused about this latest Globus Toolkit release,
&#8221; said Ian Foster, associate division director for mathematics and
 computer science at Argonne National Laboratory and professor of computer 
science at the University of Chicago.  &#8220;The Grid&#8217;s promise of 
seamlessly sharing resources 
across distributed organizations takes another major step towards 
realization with GT3 and its implementation of the OGSA standards.  The 
array of partners that we have assembled demonstrates the power of 
combining open source and open standards with industrial 
investment.&#8221;  Foster is co-leader of the Globus Project with colleagues 
Carl Kesselman (professor of computer science at the University of Southern 
California and director of the USC Information Sciences Institute&#8217;s 
Center for Grid Technologies) and Steve Tuecke (lead architect of the Argonne 
Distributed Systems Laboratory).</p>

<p>GT3 will benefit from an expanding community of developers who are closely 
involved in helping to develop Grid standards through the Global Grid Forum 
(GGF),  a community-based organization with public- and private-sector 
contributors. For example, the UK e-Science program is leading the GGF&#8217;s 
OGSA Database Access and Integration (DAIS) working group to build database 
capabilities into OGSA and GT3.  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is 
also contributing directly to the GT3 code base.</p>

<p>&#8220;GT3 provides a major step forward in the functionality provided by 
the Globus Toolkit,&#8221; said Kesselman.  &#8220;However, of equal 
importance is that GT3 
builds on OGSA, which in turn builds on Web services.  By leveraging widely 
supported commodity technologies, we can lower the barrier of entry to the 
deployment of Grids and the development of Grid technologies.  As a 
consequence, we expect to see the base of GT3 deployment to extend into new 
and important user communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The GT3 beta release will be in Spring 2003, with official release in 
Summer 2003, Tuecke emphasized.  &#8220;The term &#8216;alpha&#8217; means 
code that works to the best of its developers&#8217; knowledge, but is not 
final or bug-free,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Support for the alpha release will 
be on a best-effort basis, because the Globus Project development team will be
focused largely on improving the implementation for future releases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Development of GT3 is sponsored primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy 
through its Office of Science&#8217;s Mathematical, Information and 
Computational Sciences Division, as well as by industry partners IBM and 
Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>"Grid technologies are essential to the scientific mission of the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE)," said Ed Oliver, Associate Director for the DOE 
Advanced Scientific Computing Research Office (ASCR).  "ASCR has long 
supported this type of fundamental R&amp;D both to further the study of 
computer science, and to add important new capabilities to energy-related 
research. We are also gratified by the Grid's broad impact in commercial 
computing, which is a secondary but important
benefit."</p>

<p><b>About the Globus Project</b>
<br>The Globus Project conducts research and development to create the 
fundamental technologies behind the "Grid," which lets people share 
computing power, databases, and other tools securely online across 
corporate, institutional, and geographic boundaries without sacrificing 
local autonomy. The project's open source Globus Toolkit<sup>&#8482;</sup>
 includes software 
services and libraries for resource monitoring, discovery, and management, 
plus security and file management.  The toolkit is central to science and 
engineering projects that total nearly a half-billion dollars 
internationally, and it is the substrate on which leading IT companies are 
building significant commercial Grid products. The Globus Toolkit 2.0 
received a 2002 R&amp;D 100 Award from R&amp;D Magazine, which further honored
 the toolkit as 2002&#8217;s &#8220;Most Promising New Technology.&#8221; The 
Globus Project is based at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of 
Southern California's Information Sciences Institute. For more information,
