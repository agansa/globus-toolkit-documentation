<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><b>GLOBUS PROJECT RELEASES FIRST MAJOR SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF GRID SERVICES ARCHITECTURE<br>
<i>Globus Toolkit 3.0 reflects community&#8217;s convergence on new
Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) specification </i></b></p>

<p>CHICAGO, July 1, 2003 -- Today&#8217;s official release of the 
Globus Toolkit<sup>®</sup> 3.0 (GT3) is 
a milestone in the evolution of Grid computing, which lets people share 
computing power, databases, and other tools securely online across corporate, 
institutional, and geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy.  
GT3 is the first full-scale implementation of the Open Grid Services 
Infrastructure (OGSI) version 1.0, a new specification that the Globus Project 
played a key role in defining.</p>

<p>Previous versions of the Globus Toolkit have become central to hundreds of 
science and engineering projects on the Grid, and 
GT has been adopted for commercial offerings by major information technology 
companies.  The toolkit&#8217;s open-source software and services have 
transformed the way on-line resources are shared across organizations. </p>

<p>OGSI is part of the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) developed 
through the Global Grid Forum (GGF) to define Grid services, 
which are Web services that conform to a specific set of conventions.  
OGSI specifies a set of "service primitives" that -- rather than stipulating 
precise services -- instead establish a nucleus of behavior common to all 
Grid/Web services that can be leveraged by meta- and system-level services.  
GT3 uses this specification to provide powerful tools for resource monitoring, 
discovery, management, security and file transfer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope this will be remembered as the day Grid computing began to 
come of age,&#8221; said Ian Foster, associate division director for 
mathematics and computer science at Argonne National Laboratory and 
professor of computer science at the University of Chicago.  &#8220; GT3 is 
significant because it shows how OGSI can be used to implement Grid services 
for real-world 
applications using standard Web services tooling.  The community of developers 
is expanding rapidly thanks to these standards, with useful new tools emerging 
from research in the public and private sectors.  We believe GT3 provides the 
foundation for many new Grid applications.&#8221; </p>

<p>Foster is co-leader of the Globus Project with colleagues Carl Kesselman 
(research associate professor of computer science at the University of 
Southern California School of Engineering and director of the USC Information 
Sciences Institute&#8217;s Center for Grid Technologies) and Steve 
Tuecke (lead architect of the Globus Project at Argonne&#8217;s Distributed 
Systems Laboratory). </p>

<p>GT3 is fully compliant with OGSI v1.0, which 
recently completed its public comment period. The v1.0 specification is now an 
official GGF "Proposed Recommendation," meaning it will not change from this 
point forward.</p>

<p>Partners of the Globus Project include the UK e-Science Program and 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, both of which contributed to 
development of GT3.  IBM and Platform Computing are also providing code for 
GT3.  This combination of open source and open standards with industrial 
investment is spurring broad adoption by users seeking to share 
resources seamlessly across distributed organizations.</p>


<p>Globus Project sponsors include the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the 
National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA), IBM and Microsoft.  "The Globus Toolkit is an 
important technology transfer success," said Mary Anne Scott, program manager 
in the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Research Office (ASCR).  "ASCR 
originally funded this software development as fundamental research into 
information technology.  The project continues to grow by incorporating 
support from additional funding sources in the public and private sectors, 
while promoting open standards that are good for users whether they 
work in research labs or in the business world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leading Grid participants have previously committed to use of GT3 and OGSA.
  Companies include Avaki, Cray, Entropia, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle, 
Platform Computing, Silicon Graphics, Inc.,  Sun Microsystems, and Veridian. 
 Research projects include FusionGrid, TeraGrid, the 
Department of Energy Science Grid, the Grid Physics Network (GriPhyN), the 
Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, the International Virtual Data 
Grid Laboratory, and the NSF Middleware Initiative.  A collection of quotes 
about GT3 by these partners can be found <a href="prGT3quotes.html"> here </a>.

<p>"The Internet is about getting computers to talk together; Grid 
computing is about getting computers to work together," said Tom Hawk, IBM's 
general manager of Grid computing. "The introduction of the Globus Toolkit 3.0 
with the Open Grid Services Architecture is an important step in moving Grid 
computing beyond the laboratories of academia and research and through the 
doors of commercial enterprises.  Grid will help elevate the Internet to a true
 computing platform, combining the qualities of service of enterprise computing
 with the ability to share heterogeneous distributed resources -- everything 
from  applications, data, storage and servers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Globus Project is based at Argonne, the University of 
Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, and the University of 
Chicago.  The Globus Toolkit has been hailed as one of the top recent technical 
innovations.  It received a 2002 R&amp;D 100 Award from <i>R&amp;D Magazine</i>, which further honored the toolkit as 2002&#8217;s &#8220;Most Promising New Technology.&#8221;   <i>InfoWorld</i> magazine just named 
the project&#8217;s leaders among its top ten Innovators 2003, and the Federal 
Laboratory Consortium gave the Globus Project its 2003 Award for Excellence in 
Technology Transfer. </p>
