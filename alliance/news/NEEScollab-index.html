<p class="title">The NEES 'Collaboratory'</p>

<p>The integrated NEES(Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) 
project called NEESgrid, will link earthquake engineering research sites across
the country to provide a 'Collaboratory' of research tools for remote sites 
users of desktop workstations. Sharing computer simulation software, high-
performance computing clusters, and research data stored in online 
repositories, the NEESgrid will take advantage of the grid tools and 
technologies developed over the last five years through the NSF's Partnerships 
for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI) program, the Globus Toolkit
 for distributed computing developed at Argonne National Laboratory and grid 
technologies developed at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the 
University of Southern California (USC).</p>
