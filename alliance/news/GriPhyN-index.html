<p class="title">Globus at core of ambitious new Grid Physics Network
    project</p>

<p>The Universities of Florida and Chicago will lead an $11.9 million initiative that will lay the groundwork for a computer data grid of unprecedented speed and power, the National Science Foundation announced today.</p>

<p>The initiative, called the Grid Physics Network, or GriPhyN (pronounced "griffin"), is funded by the largest grant in the National Science Foundation's new Information Technology Research program, which supports long-term basic research on networking and information technology.</p>

<p>GriPhyN will build on a base of proven grid technologies, in particular the Globus toolkit, to provide the basic services and capabilities of a computational grid.</p>
