<p class="title">NSF Funds NCSA-led Virtual "Collaboratory" For Better Quakeproofing</p> 

<p>CHAMPAIGN, IL, August 27, 2001--A consortium of institutions led by the
    National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University 
    of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will receive $10 million to build a 
    national virtual engineering laboratory, or "collaboratory," 
    for designing earthquake-safe structures.</p>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) today announced the award, which is 
    part of its George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering 
    Simulation (NEES) project. The integrated NEES network, called NEESgrid, 
    will link earthquake engineering research sites across the country, 
    provide data storage facilities and repositories, and offer 
    remote access to the latest research tools.</p>

<p>Through NEESgrid, researchers will be able to conduct experiments using
    shake tables, centrifuges, and tsunami wave tanks from their desktop 
    workstations. They also will be able to use computer simulation 
    software and high-performance computing clusters, and share research 
    data stored in online repositories.</p>

<p>NEESgrid will take advantage of the grid tools and technologies developed
     over the last five years through the NSF's Partnerships for Advanced 
     Computational Infrastructure (PACI) program. Proven grid technologies--
     such as the Globus Toolkit for distributed computing, developed by 
     Argonne National Laboratory and the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) 
     at the University of Southern California (USC), both partners in the 
     effort--will be incorporated into NEESgrid. Globus will allow researchers 
     to seamlessly share experimental equipment, computational resources, and 
     research data.</p>

<p>In addition, NEESgrid will include collaboration and teleoperation tools 
    developed through the NSF's Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence (KDI) 
    and Information Technology Research (ITR) initiatives and through the 
    Department of Energy's DOE2000 effort. The Collaboratory for Research on 
    Electronic Work (CREW) at the University of Michigan's School of 
    Information and Argonne's materials science division have developed 
    operational collaboratories under these programs and are also members of 
    the NEESgrid team. Joining NCSA, Argonne, ISI, and CREW in developing the 
    NEESgrid are the UIUC and USC civil engineering departments and the 
    National Laboratory for Applied Network Research.
   </p>

<p>"The goal is to create a collaborative research network by linking 
    researchers and engineering testing facilities across the United States, 
    and providing them with the latest computational tools," said Priscilla 
    Nelson, NSF division director for civil and mechanical systems.  "We 
    expect this network to speed the simulations, experiments, and data 
    analysis that lead to better seismic design and hazard mitigation."</p>

<p>"The NEES collaboratory and the NEESgrid will take many of the 
    technologies developed through the PACI program and refine them for use by 
    a specific technical community," said Dan Reed, director of NCSA and the 
    National Computational Science Alliance. "This is a way for us to show the 
    impact of the work we've been doing for the last five years and how we can 
    apply what we've learned to the real-life needs of a group of scientists 
    and engineers."</p>

<p>Three communities of earthquake engineers will be served by NEESgrid: 
    (a)structural engineers, who study the impact of seismic activity on 
    buildings, bridges and other structures; (b)geotechnical engineers, who 
    study how seismic activity affects subsurface soil and rock, and the 
    foundations of buildings and infrastructure; and (c)tsunami researchers, 
    who are concerned with the formation and effects of tsunamis.</p>

<p>"NEESgrid will be an environment not only for research engineers but for 
    practicing engineers who are involved in the actual design and development 
    of roads, bridges, dams and buildings," said Tom Prudhomme, principal 
    investigator for NEESgrid. "Practicing engineers don't usually use 
    research data and complex simulation models in their work because they 
    don't have easy access to it or effective ways to validate the results. 
    That is about to change."</p>

<p>Development of NEES will continue through Sept. 30. 2004. A community-based 
    NEES Consortium will operate the NEES collaboratory beginning in October 
    2004.</p>

<p>The National Center for Supercomputing Applications is the leading-edge 
    site for the National Computational Science Alliance. NCSA is a leader in 
    the development and deployment of cutting-edge high-performance computing, 
    networking, and information technologies. The National Science Foundation, 
    the state of Illinois, the University of Illinois, industrial partners, 
    and other federal agencies fund NCSA. The National Computational Science 
    Alliance is a partnership to prototype an advanced computational 
    infrastructure for the 21st century and includes more than 50 academic, 
    government and industry research partners from across the United States.
