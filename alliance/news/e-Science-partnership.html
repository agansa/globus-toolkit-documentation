<p class="title">Globus Project and UK e-Science Program Announce OGSA Partnership</p>
    
    <p>The emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) standard for 
distributed computing has garnered a significant endorsement from the 
United Kingdom e-Science Program.  The UK data grid project will adopt OGSA 
as a common framework for on-line collaboration and contribute OGSA 
interfaces to database services for the Grid community.</p>

<p>The UK e-Science Program will contribute its OGSA database code to the open 
source Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup>, the foundation for many large-scale scienceresearch projects in the UK and elsewhere.  The toolkit--which has 
emerged as a de facto standard for Grid computing--is a community-based 
set of services and software libraries for security, information 
infrastructure, resource management, data management, communication, fault 
detection and portability.</p>

<p>The OGSA specification is being developed by the Grid community with 
leadership from the Globus Project, in partnership with IBM.  Building on 
the widespread availability of web services, OGSA is meant to create a 
seamless environment for sharing resources via the Internet.</p>

<p>In adopting OGSA as a path to interoperability and portability, the UK 
e-Science leadership is committed to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Promote the use of OGSA in UK Data Grid pilot projects
</li><li>Encourage the pilot projects to adopt software engineering 
processes geared toward OGSA
</li><li>Recommend interim strategies for the pilot projects while OGSA is 
in development
</li><li>Contribute substantially to the definition of OGSA and to the 
pioneering of related implementations, with emphasis on database access and 
integration
</li></ol>

<p>"Many of the UK pilot projects require data grids.  We expect to see 
substantial benefits from building them on the OGSA standards," said UK 
e-Science leader Tony Hey.  "Through our database access and integration 
project we expect to contribute OGSA components in the near future."</p>

<p>Hey will describe the OGSA commitment in his presentation at Edinburgh, 
Scotland, during GGF5, the Global Grid Forum meeting on July 21-24.  OGSA 
will be prominent on the conference agenda, as software users and 
developers from around the world meet to define where Grid computing is 
headed.  The GGF is a community-driven set of working groups that develop 
standards and best practices for distributed computing in the U.S., Europe, 
Canada and Asia-Pacific.</p>

<p>"Everyone at the Globus Project is pleased with the UK Data Grid&#8217;s strong 
endorsement of OGSA," said Ian Foster, associate division director at 
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and professor of computer science at the 
University of Chicago.  "For Grid computing to reach its potential as a 
ubiquitous infrastructure, the Grid services specification needs to meet 
the community's needs for interoperability and resource 
integration.  OGSA's widespread adoption in the UK will be key, as will the 
UK&#8217;s promised contributions to the specification itself."</p>

<p>Foster and colleagues Carl Kesselman (Information Sciences Institute at the 
University of Southern California), Steve Tuecke (ANL) and Jeff Nick (IBM) 
released the initial draft OGSA specification at GGF4 in February 
2002.  Since then, the community effort has proceeded, with several GGF 
working groups focused on rapid definition of Grid services.</p>
