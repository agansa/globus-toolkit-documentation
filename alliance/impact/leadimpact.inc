     <p>Globus Toolkit-driven Grid computing is central to management of 
        large datasets generated by colliders such as those at 
        <a href="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>.  This 
        simulation shows two colliding lead ions just after impact, with 
        quarks in red, blue, and green and hadrons in white.
