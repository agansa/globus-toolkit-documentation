<a name="deleg"><h4>Delegation Service</a></h4>

<p>The Delegation Service allows for the delegation of credentials when using protocols that lack inherent support for delegation. Since April 2005 the Delegation Service has been used quite successfully by the GRAM and RFT Globus technologies.  Future work includes providing the ability to query for existing credentials.  We also have plans to make configuration improvements such that the Delegation Service can work off short-term credentials.  Key collaborations include working with the EGEE community to provide interoperable services and uniform interfaces. This is a relatively new component and we are keen on gathering additional requirements and feedback from the community.</p>
