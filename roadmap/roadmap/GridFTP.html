<a name="gridftp"><h4>GridFTP</h4>

<p>GridFTP has just completed a major development cycle resulting in a brand new server released in GT 4.0.  Our near term work revolves around user support, ease of use improvements, bug fixes, etc.  We will be looking at adding support to protect the server from crashes due to OS resource exhaustion.  Our next major development cycle will involve making GridFTP a "managed resource".  We will be adding dynamic backend registration in striped servers, bandwidth throttling, interactions with storage reservations and management, and management of connections, including co-scheduling of the ends of a transfer.</p>
