<a name="dynaccts"><h4>Incubator/Dynamic Accounts</h4>

<p>The <b>Dynamic Accounts Service</b> (a.k.a., <b>WSS</b>, <b>Workspace Management Service</b>) allows an authorized Grid client to dynamically associate a Grid credential with a local Unix user account, and manage this association in terms of its lifetime and associated policies. This allows Grid clients to securely obtain on-demand access to remote resources. The current implementation works with account pools pre-created by the site administrator and provides ways of integrating site-specific management into the implementation. Our ongoing and planned work includes support for a database-backed pool account implementation, support for a C client, as well as new authorization modes. WSS has been deployed by the EGEE project and we are also working on providing support and continued feature development for this community. Several other communities (including OSG and TeraGrid) have also expressed interest in this functionality.</p>
