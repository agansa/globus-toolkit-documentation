<p>Near-term development efforts for the Community Authorization Service (CAS) include improving usability and manageability, such as adding a simplified administrative interface.  Work is also underway to add an authorization interface that augments the existing pull interface.  C client-side support is also planned.  The CAS team is eager to form collaborations with community members interested in adopting the CAS-based security model for policy management.</p>
