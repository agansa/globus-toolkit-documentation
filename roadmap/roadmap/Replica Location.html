<a name="rls"><h4>Replica Location</h4>

<p>The Replica Location Service (RLS) has been a component in the Globus Toolkit for several years. The GT4 version of RLS represents a significant improvement over earlier versions of the service in terms of scalability, robustness, performance and documentation. Our near-term work for RLS includes completion of a WS-RF interface to the service. Longer term, we are interested in adding more fine-grained authorization to RLS servers, implementation of an embedded database back end and improving the modularity and memory management of RLS server code. Several projects currently use the RLS in their production Grids. We invite new users and new requirements for RLS functionality from application communities.</p>
