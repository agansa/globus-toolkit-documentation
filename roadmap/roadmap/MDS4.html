<p>The Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS) has been a Globus technology since the first release and has continued to evolve and improve since then.  In particular, the LDAP-based Index Service has been replaced by a more robust, WSRF-compliant version, and we have added additional higher-level functionality with the Trigger Service and with the development of a generic Aggregator Framework, which allows easier development of higher level services. We have also significantly improved the level of data collected through information providers, and made it easier for users to develop their own. We now also have a GUI component, WebMDS, to allow easy access to the data across sites. With these additions, we have seen the number of users grow significantly in the last year. Our near term work includes extending the higher-level functionality by adding an archiving service, database backend to the standard index service, and significant performance improvement for the index and query behavior. We are developing additional information providers, especially in terms of additional data from Globus services and performance benchmark. We are also extending the interfaces to include C APIs and a WebMDS query page for resource selection.</p>
