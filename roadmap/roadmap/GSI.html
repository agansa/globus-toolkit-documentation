<a name="gsi"><h4>General Security</a></h4>

<p>A key focus for improvements in the general security infrastructure include usability enhancements, such as improving error reporting and diagnostics, and simplification of security configuration and setup.  Further, various feature additions are planned, such as a logging and auditing framework, support for key discovery, and development of tools for ease of policy management. Recently an attribute-based authorization framework allowing for fine grained delegation of rights was added to the Java infrastructure, and we will be working towards defining and implementing a standardized callout to support this. Other identified goals are improvements to client side authorization and adding finer-grained security support for resource properties.</p>
