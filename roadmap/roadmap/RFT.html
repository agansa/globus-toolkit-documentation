<a name="rft"><h4>Reliable File Transfer</h4>

<p>The Reliable File Transfer Service (RFT) provides job scheduler-like functionality for data movement.  It has been part of Globus Toolkit since the GT3 release.  GT4aging in executables and staging out results, and the Data Replication Service (DRS) also uses RFT for its file transfer needs. Our current focus is to improve robustness, scalability and throughput under heavy loads. We are currently working on achieving that, among other things, by adding support to reuse data transfer connections across multiple user requests. To improve ease of use we have recently added an option to use an embedded database that gets deployed and configured at installation time, enabling RFT to work out-of-the-box. Longer term we are interested in adding more "data-scheduler" like functionality to RFT, supporting priorities in transfers, and adding the ability to dynamically change the transfer request.</p>
