<p>Near-term work for the XIO (eXtensible IO) component revolves around user support, ease-of-use improvements, bug fixes, etc.  We will be working on additional APIs and utilities to improve the usability of XIO.  This includes support to make it easier to integrate third party libraries, blocking interfaces, an xio_copy library to handle copying between any two xio handles, etc.  We have prototyped an xio_perf tool, similar to a stripped down iperf, that enables apples-to-apples performance comparisons across XIO drivers.  We will continue to harden this as a testing tool and as a demonstrator of driver use.  We will also continue to support, harden, and extend our existing driver set.</p>
