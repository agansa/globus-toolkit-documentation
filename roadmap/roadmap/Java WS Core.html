<p>Java WS Core is one of the more mature technologies in Globus, and thus far has proved to be a decent platform for building and hosting java services. The current and near-term focus of Java WS Core development is on maintenance as well as providing more advanced features. Future plans include support for additional WS standards, including WS-Enumeration, as well as an improved notification/subscription infrastructure.   Such infrastructure improvements include notification pull support, notification throttling, and persistence of subscriptions to a database. Other advanced features, such as dynamic deployment, connection persistence, and support for SOAP with attachments have recently been completed and will appear in upcoming development releases.</p>
