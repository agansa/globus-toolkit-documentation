<a name="back"><h2>Background</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<a name="software"><h3>Globus Software</a></h3>
<p>Globus software development began in 1996 as part of an effort to provide the scientific community with a set of tools and services for building distributed applications.</p>

<a name="users"><h3> The Globus User Community</a></h3>
<p>One useful way of characterizing Globus users is by their level of interaction with Globus software:
<ul>
<li> <i>Infrastructure builders</i>, whose primary focus is in using the Globus software base as a means of constructing shared infrastructure for use by one of the other identified community members.  Infrastructure builders are strongly driven by manageability, configuration, deployment, and operational issues.</li>
<li><i>Application developers</i>, who build domain-specific applications using Globus software.</li>
<li><i>Service developers</i>, who use Globus tools, libraries and runtime services to build new Grid services and capabilities.  Infrastructure created by service developers is often more general-purpose than that of application developers.</i>
<li><i>End users</i>, who develop no code but interact with Globus-based infrastructure, often without realizing they are using it.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="developers"><h3> The Globus Development Community</a></h3>

<p>Globus developers are among the most talented of the computing community.  Hailing from many different countries and institutions, Globus developers are scattered around world.  Because the community is large and distributed, it does not share a common physical space. Instead, Globus development takes place over the internet, facilitated by an Apache-like forum called <i>dev.globus</i>.  The day-to-day operations of Globus development are conducted in an open fashion, using the source repositories, archived email lists, issue tracking mechanisms and web hosting at <a href="http://dev.globus.org">http://dev.globus.org</a>.</p>

<a name="purpose"><h3> The Purpose of this Roadmap</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to present the workplans of Globus developers so that the community might provide feedback.  The astute reader will note that each work item is represented as its own entry in the <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/">Globus bugzilla</a>.  All are invited to join in the Globus planning process by adding comments and suggestions to the Roadmap entries that interest them.  Community members are also welcome to <a href="roadmap/roadProcessOverview.jpg">propose new roadmap items</a>.</p>
