<a name="cwscore"><h4>C WS Core</h4>

<p>For the C WS Core component, our near-term focus is on improving ease-of-use.  We have made many improvements and will continue to work in this area.  There is significant advantage in using the C WS core for clients due to the lack of JVM startup overhead.  This is particularly advantageous when invoking the client repeatedly, such as from a script.  We will focus on enabling that usage pattern and assisting communities, particularly GlobDev communities, in utilizing C WS core for clients.  C WS Core is a fairly young implementation and there is a laundry list of features we would like to add, such as XPath integration, service sandboxing, HTTP get of schema with caching, global configuration/deployment, support for local service routing, additional secure conversation support, an improved authorization framework, and bindings improvements.</p>
