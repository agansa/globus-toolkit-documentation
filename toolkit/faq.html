<a name="N40000A">
What would one gain by turning an existing Web Service into a Grid Service?
</a>

<p>

<p>Grid Services are Web Services that provide a well-defined set of
basic functionality.  Specifically, all Grid Services provide the basic
set of methods described in the OGSI (Open Grid Services Infrastructure)
specification.</p>

<p>The general value added for Grid Services above and beyond ordinary
Web Services includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A sophisticated security infrastructure (see question on security below)
    <li>A standard service invocation mechanism for service lifetime management
    <li>State management
    <li>A standard service inquiry mechanism
</ul>

<p>Grid Services are invoked using a "service factory" mechanism. When
an application needs to use a Grid service, it contacts a "factory"
and requests an instance of the service. The factory creates a service
instance and gives the application a reference to the instance. This
standard mechanism enables sophisticated service management
capabilities.</p>

<p>Service lifetime management provides a mechanism for ensuring that
services are "cleaned up" when they are no longer needed. Each service
invocation includes an indication of how long the service will be
needed. If a client application "crashes" or simply stops communicating
with a service, the service and all resources it uses will automatically
be cleaned up when the lifetime expires. Applications may extend the
lifetime of a service if they continue to require the service beyond
the original lifetime.</p>

<p>State management allows Grid Services to maintain state between
separate requests. Rather than providing a strict request/response
interface like most Web Services, Grid service instances are persistent
(within their lifetime), enabling connectionless interactions, multiple
client connections, and client failure recovery. State management allows
a Grid service to maintain internal state between connections.</p>

<p>Grid Services provide a standard interface for applications and
other services to inquire about their internal state. For example,
a service that provides computation capabilities might provide an
interface for inquiring about the state of a computation in progress,
the type of system on which computation requests are executed, and/or
the types of computation requests that will be honored. All of these
would use a standard inquiry mechanism provided by all Grid Services,
and thus the information provided can be aggregated using standard
push and pull mechanisms and used for a variety of purposes. (E.g.,
a dynamic directory of available services, aggregation of information
on available computing power, graphical viewers showing locations and
characteristics of sites and services in a Grid, etc.)</p>

<a name="N400013">
One of our goals is for data sharing.  Does GT3 provide the capability to query data from multiple sources in a Grid environment? For example, if I wanted to search for data among all Grid Services that may provide it.
</a>

<p>

<p>The scenario described in this question is common among data-intensive
scientific applications, and one that figures prominently in our work on Grid
technologies. Key elements of the solution include:</p>

<ol>

<li>A standard framework (OGSI) for all Grid Services used in the
application; this greatly simplifies the complexity of the application
and the manageability of the Grid Services

<li>A security framework (GSI) that enables the user to delegate their
credentials to the searching service so that it can authenticate to the
many data repositories on the user's behalf (see security question
below)

<li>An OGSI-compliant metadata catalog that enables the application to
translate high-level, domain-specific descriptions of the necessary data
into specific filenames, data tables, or other physical data objects.

<li>An OGSI-compliant replica location service that tracks the locations
of all copies of physical files and data tables.

<li>An OGSI-compliant mechanism for retrieving the data from the physical
system.

<li>Standard ways to aggregate state information from a large number of
services and perform queries across all of the aggregated data.

</ol>

<p>The end user's application would allow the user to sign on once? using
their Grid pass phrase, and then would invoke the data search service,
giving it a domain-specific description of the required data.  The search
service would use the metadata catalog service to identify specific files
and/or data tables, and then the replica location service to identify
physical locations for the data. The application would then retrieve
and process the data from the physical locations.</p>

<a name="N40001C">
We would like to know more about the security in GT3. If we want to develop multiple Grid Services and deploy them in a Grid, should user authentication and authorization data be saved in a centralized DB?
</a>

<p>

<p>Security is one of the areas where the Grid provides compelling
value, and it is one of the prime motivating forces behind the Grid
movement. The Grid approach to security is to use PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure) technology coupled with Web Services.  Grid technology
offers a compelling "single sign on" capability that allows end-user
applications to utilize many Grid Services without forcing the end
user to keep track of multiple credentials or to enter authorization
information more than once.</p>

<p>Authentication is accomplished using Grid certificates.  Each end
user and each service has a certificate associated with it.  The end
user must enter a "pass phrase" in order to allow an application to
access their certificate, and the application may then use the same
certificate to authenticate the user to any number of Grid Services.
The application may also "delegate" the user's credential to a Grid
service, allowing that Grid service to use other Grid Services on the end
user's behalf. The end user's certificate may be stored on their local
computer system, in an electronic "smartcard," or in a secure online
"credential repository" where it can be accessed by the user from any
location. (The latter capability is useful for people who use multiple
computer systems, including public terminals.)</p>

<p>Each Grid service must be configured to authorize specific users
to use the service. (Users are specified by the name in their Grid
certificate, as opposed to a local account name that would vary from
system to system.) In large Grids, manual configuration of every
user on every service may not be possible, so the Grid community
has developed a number of tools to ease this work, including tools to
synchronize authorization data for multiple services and tools to manage
authorization in a collective fashion (essentially enabling management
of entire classes or groups of users rather than individuals).</p>

<p>Grid security relies on trusted "certificate authorities" to issue
certificates for both users and Grid Services.  A Grid service may accept
certificates from several certificate authorities, and an end user
may have certificates issued by more than one certificate authority.
A number of public and private certificate authorities are available,
and open source software for operating a certificate authority is also
available.</p>

<a name="N400025">
How would one convert an existing Web Service to a Grid Service?
</a>

<p>

<p>Grid Services are web services that provide the basic set of
methods described in the OGSI (Open Grid Services Infrastructure)
specification. The Globus Toolkit 3.0 provides Java classes that
implement the OGSI core features.  If an existing web service is written
in Java, the service implementation can be modified to be a subclass
of these basic Grid service classes, so that the OGSI functionality
is provided automatically. Additional work could then be done to more
cleanly integrate the capabilities offered by the OGSI methods and the
features offered by the original web service. To take full advantage of
the capabilities offered by the OGSA architecture, the application might
require some reorganization. The degree to which OGSA is incorporated
into an application is actually quite flexible.</p>

</p>




<a name="N40002E">
We would like to make our Grid Services fully portable to other sites.  How easily can one download, install and deploy a Grid service?
</a>

<p>

<p>Grid Services are essentially the same as Web Services.  They require
a hosting environment and an OGSI implementation, but otherwise they
are fairly simple pieces of Java, Python, or .NET code.</p>

<p>There are several options for the hosting environment, ranging from
a standalone hosting environment provided with the Globus Toolkit 3.0 to
open source hosting environments such as J2EE/J2SE or commercial hosting
environments such as Oracle Application Server or IBM's WebSphere.</p>

<p>The Globus Toolkit 3.0's OGSI implementation (a set of Java classes)
can be easily installed with or without the rest of the Globus Toolkit. (Python and .NET OGSI implementations are also available from the Grid
community.)</p>

<p>Once the hosting environment and OGSI implementation are installed,
installing and deploying a Grid Service is roughly the same as installing
and deploying a Web Service.</p>

<p>We have a couple of packaging techniques using GPT and gars which you might
find useful.</p>

Are there any other OGSI implementations?

<a name="overloading">
Does GT3 and/or OGSI support operation overloading?
</a>

<p>
<p>OGSI has no notion of operation overloading. Operation overloading was allowed under WSDL 1.1 but it is not allowed in WSDL 1.2. We do not recommend relying on operation overloading as it may cause problems with dynamic systems such as workflow engines.</p>
<p>Use separately named operations with different syntaxes, or one generic operation with generic/document-extensible syntax instead.</p>

<a name="hotdeploy">
     Can I deploy my services into a container at run time?
   </a>
   
<p>
    We currently don't support this for persistent services. All persistent services have to be deployed into the container when its hosting environment is not running. Transient services (created by factories) are however designed to be deployed at run time into a container. Future versions may allow run time deployment of persistent services as well.

<a name="activateOnStartup">
What do I have to do to make sure that my service is activated when the container starts up?
    </a>
    
<p>
When a container starts up, all its services are deactivated by default. In order to change that behavior you need to set the property "activateOnStartup" to "true" in the service section of your service in the deployment descriptor. Note that activation will then take place the first time the container is loaded. In the case of our standalone container this happens at server startup, but in the case of a Servlet Engine, like Tomcat, it does not happen until the servlet is loaded as result of an invocation.

<a name="N400062">
Why can I only access my service running on Linux from the local host?
</a>

<p>
If you do not have an entry in etc/hosts for your current IP address, the loopback address 127.0.0.1 will be used to publish the service handle, and thus limiting access to it to the local host. Updating the etc/hosts file is hence recommended. You can however also specify what DNS name should be exposed in the handle of a service by setting the global parameter "logicalHostName" in you server-config.wsdd file in the globalConfiguration section. See User's Guide for details.

<a name="N400075">
I get a socket read timeout error during heavy load, how can I change that behavior?
</a>

<p>



<p>The ogsilogging.properties file contains the log filter settings you
would need to change. This file must be in your current directory or in
the classpath in order to be correctly read by our container. When
deploying your services into Tomcat this file ends up in &lt;tomcat
dir&gt;/webapps/ogsa/WEB-INF. In order to read the settings in this file
after your modifications you need to add that directory to your
CLASSPATH variable before you start tomcat.</p>

<p><a name="105">I get a socket read timeout error during heavy load,
how can I change that behavior?</a>

<p>By default the timeout of a Grid service invocation is 60 seconds. In
order to change this behavior you have two options:

<ol>
<li>Change a property on the stub that you use to invoke the service. How
to do that is described in the following FAQ:

<ul>
<p><a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout">
http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout</a>
</ul>

<p>See our Performance Guide for more details.

<li>In you client JVM set the system property:

<pre class=command>
 -Dorg.globus.ogsa.client.timeout=(milliseconds)
</pre>

<p>To set system properties for the globus provided command line clients in
the bin directory set the OPTIONS environment variable to the full
string -Dorg....

<p>If you use version 3.0 or earlier you need to do two additional things
to enable this feature:

<ul>
<p>2.1 Download timeout handler gar from:

<ul>
<a href="ftp://ftp.globus.org/pub/gt3/3.0/3.0.0/ogsa-timeout.gar">
ftp://ftp.globus.org/pub/gt3/3.0/3.0.0/ogsa-timeout.gar</a>
</ul>

<p>and deploy it using:

<pre class=command>
 ant deploy -Dgar.name=ogsa-timeout.gar
</pre>

<p>2.2 Change the client-config.wsdd file in your distribution to contain
this handle in the requestFlow Ex:

<pre class=command>
 &lt;requestFlow&gt;
   &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.TimeOutHandler"/&gt;
   &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.RoutingRequestHandler"/&gt;
...
</pre>

<p>Make sure that your modified client-config.wsdd is either in the same
directory from where you run the client or in the classpath of the
client JVM.</p>
</ul>
</ol>

<a name="antReq">
Is Apache Ant a required or optional tool?
</a>

<p>
Apache Ant is a required tool for the GT3 source distribution. It is used to compile and assemble all the GT3 code. With the binary installations, Ant is needed to generate platform-specific command-line scripts for executing GT3 clients. It is also needed to deploy and undeploy new services to and from the GT3 container. If  you don't need this functionality Ant is not required for binary installations. For developing new services we recommend using Ant as GT3 already provides lots of common operations as callable Ant tasks.

<a name="shutdown">
How do I shut down the container after the MMJFS is deployed?
</a>

<p>
If you installed the MMJFS, then the container will start up with the grim credentials by default. To shut it down you then also need to use the grim credentials. The easiest way of doing that is to set the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable to point to the grim proxy that was generated for your user. Typically that is /tmp/x509cp_[user]_grim.
