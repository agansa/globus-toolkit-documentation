<h1>The Globus Project</h1>

<p>The Globus Project is a collaborative effort which conducts
research and development into the fundamental technologies behind
Grid computing.  Based at Argonne National Laboratory, the Information
Sciences Institute, and the University of Chicago, it is organized around
four main activities:</p>

        The Globus Project studies problems in areas such as resource
        management, grid security, information services, and data
        management.<br>

        The Globus Project works on building robust research software
        that enables technologies, including software core to Grid
        computing.<br>

<p>Just as the World Wide Web has revolutionized the way we think
about information, the Globus Project's goal is to achieve a similar
result in computation.  One can hardly imagine the types of applications
we might construct if access to supercomputers and mass storage were
as straightforward as access to the Web.  That is the promise of Grid
computing.</p>

<h1>The Globus Toolkit</h1>

<p>The Globus Toolkit is open source software being developed by the
Globus Project and collaborators all over the world.  Used for building
grids, it exposes computing resources the way the Web exposes information.
The toolkit contains several components which help it achieve its
goal.</p>

<p>The Globus Toolkit has grown through an open-source strategy
similar to the Linux kernel and is distinct from proprietary attempts
at resource-sharing software.  Its open-source approach and liberal
license encourages broader, more rapid adoption and leads to greater
technical innovation.</p>

<p>The upcoming release of the Globus Toolkit is based around <a
href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/">OGSA</a> and is working to:

<ul>
<li>Deliver an open source implementation of OGSI
<li>Provide several, higher-level, OGSI-compliant services
<li>Give developers the ability to create new OGSI-compliant services
</ul>

<p>The OGSI core is the foundation for the higher level grid services
provided in the toolkit.  It uses GSI to provide security and is the
basis for all new grid services.</p>
