<h2>Startup and Initialization</h2>


<p>There are a number of initialization operations that can slow down the first
invocation on a service. The container activates all its services on first use,
unless they are explicitly configured to be activated on startup. The first
activation of a service in a JVM is going to be slow since typically a whole set
of jars need to be loaded into memory at that point. The same goes for the a
client application and its first use of a client stub. When factories are
activated, meta data configured for the services are dynamically loaded into
memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decrease the startup time of a service container you can start it up using
the -lazy argument. This will suppress the default behavior of querying the
container for all its registered services.<br>
</p>
<h2>Memory Usage</h2>



<p>A service takes up something in the order of 40kB in active state. In order
to minimize the footprint of the server you can configure your services to be
deactivated when not used. The service will be deactivated after a configurable
TTL value (in seconds) specified in the deployment descriptor of the factory like below:</p>



<p> &lt;parameter name="lifecycleMonitorClass" value="org.globus.ogsa.repository.DefaultServiceDeactivator"/><br>
  &lt;parameter name="instanceDeactivation" value="10000"/>
</p>



<p>Note that even if you deactivate a service some meta data will be available
in order to be able to quickly activate the service again. If you don't want the
container to keep any meta data at all for deactivated services you need to use
a ServiceLoader that minimally needs to recover the handle and the timeout of a
service. Look at the samples/counter/deactivation/CounterFactoryService service
for an example. Note that the ServiceLoader implementation is only used for demo
purposes, so you would need to plug in your own ServiceLoader.<br>
</p>



<h2>Invocation Overhead</h2>



<p>On an IBM ThinkPad T22, Pentium II, running Windows 2000 we have seen basic
local machine roundtrip invocation overhead in the order of 5-10ms, and for
basic service creation calls the overhead is around 25-30ms. Activation of a
factory service takes about 130-140ms. Note these numbers should only be used as
ballpark figures when profiling your services built on top of the framework.</p>



<h2>Service Container Profiling</h2>



<p>For programmatic ways to instrument your services look at the <a href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's
Guide</a>.&nbsp; To run an hprof instrumented service container with Suns JDK
you can do as follows:</p>
<p>From the root of the distribution run ant -f build-services.xml
profileContainer. Now you can run clients against the container that exercise
the service you want to profile.</p>
<p>When you are done with profiling you can stop the container using ant
stopContainer. On exit a profile log will be dumped into profile.txt. Note that
the container will run much slower when instrumented.</p>
