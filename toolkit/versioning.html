<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>The Globus Toolkit versioning scheme is similar to the approach used for
the Linux kernel.  Distributions of the Globus Toolkit are 
tagged with a version number consisting of three parts:</p>

  <p align="center">&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;incremental&gt;</p>

<p>The <i>major</i> release number represents the major state of the Globus 
Toolkit. It is incremented when significant architectural shifts 
occur in toolkit development.</p>

<p>A change in the <i>minor</i> release number indicates that new features 
have been added to the Globus Toolkit since the last release.  Though 
infrequent, API changes may occur between minor releases.</p>

<p>The <i>incremental</i> release number changes when existing 
components of the Globus Toolkit have been updated.  These releases 
generally are triggered by one or more bug fixes.  Public interfaces do not change
between increments of stable releases.</p>

<h2>Stable and Development Releases</h2>

<p>There are two series in the Globus Toolkit release stream: stable and development. 
Stable distributions have an <i>even</i> minor version
number, while development distributions have an <i>odd</i>
minor version number. For example:</p>

<table border="0" width="91%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td height=30 width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
    Stable Releases
</td>
<td height=30 width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
    Development Releases
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-4.0.1</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-3.9.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-4.0.0</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">globus-3.9.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-3.2.1
</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">globus-3.3.0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Releases in the development series are used to publish new features 
in a timely manner.
Development distributions may behave in unpredictable ways and should not 
be used in production settings.
Unlike stable releases, feature additions and changes to public
interfaces can happen between incremental versions of development
releases.</p>


<h2>Support Commitment</h2>


<p>The Globus Alliance offers support for the last two stable releases.  
Support is provided on a best effort basis. Since no new features can be 
added once a stable release is cut, code changes on stable releases are 
limited to bug fixes.</p>

<p>A development release does <i>not</i> receive the same level of
support from the Globus Alliance as a stable release. For a development
release, new features are given priority over bug fixes.</p>

<p>Releases that are no longer supported by the Globus Alliance will 
remain available in the FTP archive.</p>
