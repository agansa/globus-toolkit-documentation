<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>The Globus Toolkit versioning scheme is similar to the approach used for
the Linux kernel prior to 3.0.  Distributions of the Globus Toolkit are 
tagged with a version number consisting of three parts:</p>

  <p align="center"><i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>point</i></p>

<p>The <i>major</i> release number represents the major state of the Globus 
Toolkit. It is incremented when significant architectural shifts 
occur in toolkit development.</p>

<p>A change in the <i>minor</i> release number indicates that many new features 
have been added to the Globus Toolkit since the last release.  
API changes and binary incompatibility may occur between minor releases.</p>

<p>The <i>point</i> release number changes when 
components of the Globus Toolkit have been updated.  Public interfaces may be
added but not removed between point releases of the stable release version.  Point
releases are made to make it easier to update an installation when using source
packages and to provide a consistent set of documentation for a collection of
package versions.
</p>

<p>An installation can be upgraded to a new point release via native packages with
the expectation that all services and libraries should continue to work as
before, unless new features are enabled.
</p>

<p>In addition, release candidates are occasionally made available prior to a
public release, to encourage widespread testing. These versions are numbered as above,
but with an rc<i>version</i> suffix, e.g. <b>5.2.2rc1</b>.

<h2>Stable and Development Releases</h2>

<p>There are two series in the Globus Toolkit release stream: stable and development. 
Stable distributions have an <i>even</i> minor version
number, while development distributions have an <i>odd</i>
minor version number. For example:</p>

<table border="0" width="91%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td height=30 width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
    Stable Releases
</td>
<td height=30 width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
    Development Releases
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-4.0.1</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-3.9.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-4.0.0</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">globus-3.9.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-3.2.1
</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">globus-3.3.0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Releases in the development series are used to publish new features 
in a timely manner.
Development distributions may behave in unpredictable ways and should not 
be used in production settings.
Unlike stable releases, there is no guarantee of binary compatibility between
point versions of development versions.</p>

<h2>Package Repositories</h2>
<p>Starting with GT 5.2, the Globus Toolkit is provided as a set of native
binary package for a number of linux-based platforms. These packages are extensively
tested by the Globus Toolkit team and provide a convenient way to install the Globus
Toolkit software.
</p>

<p> 
For the GT 5.2 releases, there is a stable repository and a testing repository. The
stable repository includes all packages in the latest 5.2 point release, as well as 
all update packages available from the <a
href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/advisories.html">update packages page</a>. This
repository is rooted at the
<a href="http://www.globus.org/ftppub/gt5/5.2/stable">stable repository page</a>,
with subdirectories for each supported platform.
</p>
<p>The testing repository contains the above packages, plus new versions of packages
that have not been as thoroughly tested and documented, or published as updates.
The testing repository is rooted at the
<a href="http://www.globus.org/ftppub/gt5/5.2/testing">testing repository page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Support Commitment</h2>


<p>The Globus Alliance offers support for the last two stable minor releases.  
Support is provided on a best effort basis. </p>

<p>A development release does <i>not</i> receive the same level of
support from the Globus Alliance as a stable release. For a development
release, new features are given priority over bug fixes.</p>

<p>Releases that are no longer supported by the Globus Alliance
remain available in the FTP archive.</p>
