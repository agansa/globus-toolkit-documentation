<p><b>Q: I just installed GridFTP but the performance is no better than FTP.</b>
<p><b>A:</b> One of the most common problems why users do not initially see the performance advantage with GridFTP is because the default TCP buffer size was used. To ensure maximum performance it is highly recommended to set the TCP Buffer size to the bandwidth delay product:
<pre>[Buffer size (KB) = Bandwidth (Mbs) * Round trip delay timeï¿½(ms) / 8]</pre> Another plan is to use parallel streams. See <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/clusterworld/0904GridFinal.pdf">Performance Tuning of GridFTP</a>.
<p>A rough heuristic guideline for the buffer  is as follows:
<pre>
        Distance between transfer sites         Recommended Buffer Size
                10 miles                           64 Kbytes (Default)
                100 miles                          0.5 MByte
                300 miles                          1.5 MByte
                1,000 miles                        5 MByte
                3,000 miles                        12 MByte
                10,000 miles                       25 MByte
</pre>
<p>Larger buffer sizes can be used, but these use additional TCP buffer space that may be limited on systems where many simultaneous transfers are occurring.
