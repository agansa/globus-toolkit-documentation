 <p id="draft">This information is provided as a preview only and will be moved to development documentation for the next dev release (4.1.3).</p>
 
 <p>MOPS (Managed Object Placement Service) is an enhancement to the Globus GridFTP server that allows you to manage some of the 
resources needed for the data transfer in a more efficient way.</p>

<p>MOPS 0.1 release includes the following:</p>

<ol><li><strong>GFork</strong> - This is a service like inetd that listens on a TCP port and runs a configurable executable in a child process whenever a connection is made.  
GFork also creates bi-directional pipes between the child processes and the master service.  These pipes are used for interprocess communication 
 between the child process executables and a master process plugin. More information on GFork can be found <a href="gfork.html">here</a>.<br/><br/></li>

<li><strong>GFork master plugin for GridFTP</strong> - This master plugin provides enhanced functionality such as dynamic backend registration for striped servers, 
managed system memory pools and internal data monitoring for both striped and non striped servers. More information on the GridFTP master plugin and
 information on how to run the Globus GridFTP server with GFork can be found <a href="gfork_plugin.html">here</a>.<br/><br/></li>

<li><strong>Storage usage enforcement using Lotman</strong> - All data sent to a Lotman-enabled GridFTP server and written to the Lotman root directory will be managed 
 by Lotman. Information on how to configure Lotman and run it with the Globus GridFTP server can be found <a href="lotman.html">here</a>.<br/><br/></li>
    
    <li><strong>Pipelining data transfer commands</strong> - GridFTP is a command response protocol. A client sends one command and then waits for a "Finished response" 
     before sending another. Adding this overhead on a per-file basis for a large data set partitioned into <em>many</em> small files makes the performance suffer. 
    Pipelining allows the client to have many outstanding, unacknowledged transfer commands at once. Instead of being forced to wait for the "Finished response" 
    message, the client is free to send transfer commands at any time. Pipelining is enabled by using the <code>-pp</code> option with <code>globus-url-copy</code>.</li>
</ol>
