<p>Here are the key advantages of GridFTP-Lite:
<ul>
<li><h4>Performance:</h4>Typically GridFTP-Lite provides order of magnitude performance
improvements compared to standard FTP. GridFTP-Lite achieves good performance by
using parallel streams to minimize bottlenecks inherent in TCP/IP and non-TCP
protocols such as UDT. 
</li>
<li><h4>Cluster-to-cluster data movement:</h4> GridFTP-Lite can do coordinated data transfer by using multiple computer nodes at the source and destination. This approach can increase performance by another order of magnitude. 
</li>
<li><h4>Security:</h4>
The control channel is authenticated and encrypted using SSH and a shared secret
is passed down this encrypted channel to authenticate, integrity-protect or
encrypt the data channel.
<li><h4>Partial File Transfer:</h4> In many cases in the scientific community it
is expedient to download only portions of a large file, instead of the entire
file. GridFTP-Lite supports this capability by specifying the byte position in the file to begin the transfer.</li>
<li><h4>Third Party Control and Reliable/Restartable Data Transfer:</h4> In many
cases, reliability is more important than speed.  In fact, the desire for speed
is born out of the user needing to baby-sit the transfer, not some intrinsic
application need. To enable reliability, GridFTP-Lite server automatically sends restart markers (checkpoints) to the client.  If the transfer has a fault, the client may restart the transfer and provide the markers received.  The server will restart the transfer, picking up where it left off based on the markers. Additionally clients are able to act as a third-party to initiate transfers between remote sites.</li>
<li><h4>Modular and Extensible:</h4> 
    <ul>
<li><h5>Interaction with Storage Systems:</h5>
The Data Storage Interface (DSI) completely abstracts away the underlying
storage. If the user can implement the DSI for a storage system, then a
GridFTP-Lite server can be put in front of the storage system. We currently have DSIs for POSIX filesystems, <a href="http://www.hpss-collaboration.org/">HPSS</a> and the <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">Storage Resource Broker (SRB)</a>.
</li>
<li><h5>Interaction with the Network:</h5> The eXtensible IO (XIO) system
utilizes a read, write, open, close abstraction that GridFTP-Lite is able to
leverage in order to be transport-protocol-agnostic. Hence, in environments where
it makes sense, protocols much more aggressive than TCP can be utilized. To meet
more specific extensibility needs, we also provide easy-to-use development
libraries. Currently there is an XIO driver for UDT and GridFTP-Lite can use UDT as
an alternate transport mechanism for TCP.</li>
