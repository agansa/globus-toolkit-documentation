<h1 class="first">The GridFTP Advantage</h1>

<p>The Globus GridFTP reference implementation is widely used for securely moving massive amounts of data in the scientific and many commercial communities. There are multiple reasons that give GridFTP this advantage:
<ul>
<li><h4>Security:</h4>The Globus GridFTP server and client utilizes the GSI protocol that not only enables a secure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) interface but adds the capability of delegated authority via X.509 certificates. Delegated authority is critical for large collaboration efforts and enables single sign-on in virtual organizations, thereby eliminating the need for the user to enter passwords onto what can be hundreds of different sites. For additional information on Globus security see the <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/security/">official documentation</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Performance using Parallel Streams:</h4> GridFTP supports multiple TCP streams in parallel between a single source and destination. On wide-area links, this feature can improve aggregate bandwidth relative to that achieved by a single stream. Typical performance improvements range from a factor of 3 to 5 times higher than FTP alone, by using multiple parallel streams to minimize bottlenecks inherent in TCP/IP. See <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/clusterworld/0904GridFinal.pdf">Performance Tuning of GridFTP</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Performance using Striping:</h4> GridFTP supports striped parallel file transfers that can increase this performance factor by an order of magnitude. Moreover, striping and parallelism may be used in tandem; that is, one may have multiple TCP streams open between each of the multiple servers participating in a striped transfer.  See also <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers/gridftp_final.pdf">GridFTP Striping Architecture and Performance</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Partial File Transfer:</h4> In many cases in the scientific community it is expedient to download only portions of a large file, instead of the entire file. GridFTP supports this capability by specifying the byte position in the file to begin the transfer.</li>
<li><h4>Third Party Control and Reliable/Restartable Data Transfer:</h4> In many cases, reliability is more important than speed.  In fact, the desire for speed is born out of the user needing to baby-sit the transfer, not some intrinsic application need. To enable reliability, the GridFTP server automatically sends restart markers (checkpoints) to the client.  If the transfer has a fault, the client may restart the transfer and provide the markers received.  The server will restart the transfer, picking up where it left off based on the markers. The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service goes one step further by providing a service interface (job submission like interface) and writing the restart markers to a database so that it can survive a local fault. Additionally clients are able to act as a third-party to initiate transfers between remote sites.</li>
<li><h4>Data Extensibility:</h4> The Data Storage Interface (DSI) completely abstracts away the underlying storage. If the user can implement the DSI, then a GridFTP-compliant server can be put in front of the source of data. We currently have DSIs for POSIX filesystems, <a href="http://www.hpss-collaboration.org/">HPSS</a>, the <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">Storage Resource Broker (SRB)</a>, and a prototype DSI for doing space reservation via the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/nest/">Condor NeST</a> storage utility.</li>
<li><h4>Protocol Extensibility:</h4> The Globus eXtensible IO (XIO) system utilizes a read, write, open, close abstraction that Globus GridFTP is able to leverge in order to be transport protocol agnostic. Hence, in environments where it makes sense, protocols much more aggressive than TCP can be utilized. To meet more specific extensibility needs, we also provide easy-to-use development libraries. Currently there is an XIO driver for UDT.</li>
</ul>
