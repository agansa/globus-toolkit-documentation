<p>"One Australian user left nearly 1TB of data on our systems that we had been struggling to transfer 
    via standard FTP for several weeks. The typical data rate using multiple sessions of scp was ~200 KB/s. 
    Using GridFTP we are now moving data at 6 MB/s, quite a significant boost in performance!"<br/>
    <strong><small>- Brian Tieman and Francesco De Carlo, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory - Mar, 2008</small></strong></p>

<p>"Using GridFTP, we moved about 1.5 TB of data from University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee to 
    Hannover, Germany at a sustained rate of 80 MB/s. We were quite pleased with 80 MB/s."<br/>

<p>"Getting large datasets to our GPFS filesystem can be greatly speeded  
up by using striped transfers with GridFTP. For example transferring a  
14GB file from the UC/ANL TeraGrid site to the CI GPFS cluster using  
scp took almost 28 minutes at an average 8.6MB/s. That same file  
transferred via GridFTP took 6.5 minutes for an average of 37.3MB/s or  
a 4.3x increase over scp. And lastly that same file transferred via a  
striped GridFTP took just over 3 minutes for an average of 75.8MB/s or  
a 2.0x increase over non-striped GridFTP or an 8.8x increase over scp."<br/>

<p>"Using GridFTP, we currently get up to 200 MB/s on the TeraGrid network between Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC)."<br/>

<p>"ChinaGrid's data service uses GridFTP as its underly data transfer tool. Its
third-party data transfer capability enables us to use a centrally managed
service to control all the data transfer tasks, simplifying our data service's
design, configuration and management greatly. ChinaGrid applications such as
BioInformatics Grid, Computational Fluid Dynamics Grid, Massive Information
Processing Grid, Image processing Grid move huge volumes of data all over China
using GridFTP. GridFTP's parallel data transfer and other optimizations to
improve the speed enables the ChinaGrid applications to get better data transfer
rates." <br/>

<p>"GridFTP has been a pivotal part of our application development, providing
the fast, reliable and secure communication that underpins our applications for
the large-scale service infrastructures we have created. Its use has been
particularly significant in our work with the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) in prototyping next generation on-demand media infrastructures. In these
applications GridFTP has been used to provide a media streaming service and has
been embedded in set-top boxes to provide fast on-demand download of video
content. GridFTP has proven more effective than the traditional proprietary
tools that are more often used in a broadcast infrastructure. For our BBC
applications, GridFTP has been used to move thousands of hours of video content
between sites and to users."<br/>

<p>"The data rates available with SSH authenticated globus-url-copy are
roughly double (100MB/sec vs 50MB/sec) what we were achieving with
other high speed data movement tools at a fraction of the system resource 
utilization.  Having an SSH authenticated GridFTP has allowed us to quickly 
deploy globus-url-copy using our existing infrastructure."<br/>

<p>"We now have 2 beamlines routinely automating data movement using GridFTP as
part of the acquisition workflow with plans for 2 more to begin working this way
in the next 1-2 months.  The ability to script data movement 3rd party is really
working well for us.  Not only are we moving data ~4 times faster than before,
the ability to pipe it during acquisition rather than burst it all at the end
has been a big boon!"<br/>
