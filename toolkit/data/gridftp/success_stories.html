<p>"One Australian user left nearly 1TB of data on our systems that we had been struggling to transfer 
    via standard FTP for several weeks. The typical data rate using multiple sessions of scp was ~200 KB/s. 
    Using GridFTP we are now moving data at 6 MB/s, quite a significant boost in performance!"<br/>
    <strong><small>- Brian Tieman and Francesco De Carlo, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory - Mar, 2008</small></strong></p>

<p>"Using GridFTP, we moved about 1.5 TB of data from University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee to 
    Hannover, Germany at a sustained rate of 80 MB/s. We were quite pleased with 80 MB/s."<br/>

<p>"Getting large datasets to our GPFS filesystem can be greatly speeded  
up by using striped transfers with GridFTP. For example transferring a  
14GB file from the UC/ANL TeraGrid site to the CI GPFS cluster using  
scp took almost 28 minutes at an average 8.6MB/s. That same file  
transferred via GridFTP took 6.5 minutes for an average of 37.3MB/s or  
a 4.3x increase over scp. And lastly that same file transferred via a  
striped GridFTP took just over 3 minutes for an average of 75.8MB/s or  
a 2.0x increase over non-striped GridFTP or an 8.8x increase over scp."<br/>

<p>"Using GridFTP, we currently get up to 200 MB/s on the TeraGrid network between Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC)."<br/>

<p>"The data rates available with SSH authenticated globus-url-copy are
roughly double (100MB/sec vs 50MB/sec) what we were achieving with
other high speed data movement tools at a fraction of the system resource 
utilization.  Having an SSH authenticated GridFTP has allowed us to quickly 
deploy globus-url-copy using our existing infrastructure."<br/>
