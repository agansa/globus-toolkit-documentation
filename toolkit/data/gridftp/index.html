<p>The Globus GridFTP server and client tools and libraries make up a robust
product suite designed to move large amounts of data faster, more securely, and
more reliably than standard FTP.
<ul>
<li>GridFTP can be used either stand alone or as part of the Globus Toolkit.</li>
<li>Typical performance improvements range an order of magnitude higher than FTP
and can jump to multiple orders of magnitude when <a href="advantage.html">striping
or cluster-to-cluster data movement</a> functionality is used.</li>
<li>GridFTP provides a scriptable command-line client (globus-url-copy), a highly extensible server, and a flexible set of development libraries for custom solutions. </li>
  <li>GridFTP also has a Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) compliant web
  service client called <a
  href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/data/rft/">Reliable File Transfer
  (RFT) service</a>. It provides "job scheduler"-like functionality for data movement.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Check out all the useful GT components at <a href="/toolkit/">www.globus.org/toolkit/</a>. The Globus Toolkit 
    is packaged as a set of components that can be used either independently or together to develop Grid applications. It includes software for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>security,</li> 
    <li>information infrastructure,</li> 
    <li>resource management,</li> 
      <li>data management,</li> 
      <li>communication, </li>
    <li>fault detection, and </li>
    <li>portability.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>Every organization has unique modes of operation, and collaboration between multiple organizations is hindered when 
      resources such as data archives, computers, and networks are incompatible.  The Globus Toolkit was conceived 
      to remove obstacles that prevent seamless collaboration. Its core services, interfaces and protocols allow users to access remote 
      resources as if they were located within their own machine room while simultaneously preserving local control over who can use which resources and when.</p>
