<p>The Globus GridFTP server and client tools and libraries make up a robust product suite designed to move large amounts of data faster, more securely, and more reliably than FTP alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>GridFTP can be used either stand alone or as part of the Globus Toolkit.</li>
<li>Typical performance improvements range from a factor of 3 to 5 times higher than FTP and can jump by orders of magnitude when <a href="#advantage">striping</a> is introduced.</li>
<li>GridFTP provides a scriptable command-line client, a highly extensible server, and a flexible set of development libraries for custom solutions. </li>
<li>Integrated with the <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/data/rft/">Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service</a>, similar to a job scheduler, where the user can submit a data movement "job" for it to manage.</li>

<h3>The GridFTP Advantage</h3>
<p>The Globus GridFTP reference implementation is widely used for securely moving massive amounts of data in the scientific and many commercial communities. There are multiple reasons that give GridFTP this advantage:
<ul>
<li><h4>Security:</h4>The Globus GridFTP server and client utilizes the GSI protocol that not only enables a secure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) interface but adds the capability of delegated authority via X.509 certificates. Delegated authority is critical for large collaboration efforts and enables single sign-on in virtual organizations, thereby eliminating the need for the user to enter passwords onto what can be hundreds of different sites. For additional information on Globus security see the <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/security/">official documentation</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Performance using Parallel Streams:</h4> GridFTP supports multiple TCP streams in parallel between a single source and destination. On wide-area links, this feature can improve aggregate bandwidth relative to that achieved by a single stream. Typical performance improvements range from a factor of 3 to 5 times higher than FTP alone, by using multiple parallel streams to minimize bottlenecks inherent in TCP/IP. See <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/clusterworld/0904GridFinal.pdf">Performance Tuning on GridFTP</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Performance using Striping:</h4> GridFTP supports striped parallel file transfers that can increase this performance factor by an order of magnitude. Moreover, striping and parallelism may be used in tandem; that is, one may have multiple TCP streams open between each of the multiple servers participating in a striped transfer.  See also <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers/gridftp_final.pdf">GridFTP Striping Architecture and Performance</a>.</li>
<li><h4>Partial File Transfer:</h4> In many cases in the scientific community it is expedient to download only portions of a large file, instead of the entire file. GridFTP supports this capability by specifying the byte position in the file to begin the transfer.</li>
<li><h4>Third Party Control and Reliable/Restartable Data Transfer:</h4> In many cases, reliability is more important than speed.  In fact, the desire for speed is born out of the user needing to baby-sit the transfer, not some intrinsic application need. To enable reliability, the GridFTP server automatically sends restart markers (checkpoints) to the client.  If the transfer has a fault, the client may restart the transfer and provide the markers received.  The server will restart the transfer, picking up where it left off based on the markers. The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service goes one step further by providing a service interface (job submission like interface) and writing the restart markers to a database so that it can survive a local fault. Additionally clients are able to act as a third-party to initiate transfers between remote sites.</li>
<li><h4>Data Extensibility:</h4> The Data Storage Interface (DSI) completely abstracts away the underlying storage. If the user can implement the DSI, then a GridFTP-compliant server can be put in front of the source of data. We currently have DSIs for POSIX filesystems, <a href="http://www.hpss-collaboration.org/">HPSS</a>, the <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">Storage Resource Broker (SRB)</a>, and a prototype DSI for doing space reservation via the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/nest/">Condor NeST</a> storage utility.</li>
<li><h4>Protocol Extensibility:</h4> The Globus eXtensible IO (XIO) system utilizes a read, write, open, close abstraction that Globus GridFTP is able to leverge in order to be transport protocol agnostic. Hence, in environments where it makes sense, protocols much more aggressive than TCP can be utilized. To meet more specific extensibility needs, we also provide easy-to-use development libraries. Currently there is an XIO driver for UDT.</li>

<h3>GridFTP FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Q: I just installed GridFTP but the performance is no better than FTP.</b>
<p><b>A:</b> One of the most common problems why users do not initially see the performance advantage with GridFTP is because the default TCP buffer size was used. To ensure maximum performance it is highly recommended to set the TCP Buffer size to the bandwidth delay product:
<pre>[Buffer size (KB) = Bandwidth (Mbs) * Round trip delay time (ms) / 8]</pre> Another plan is to use parallel streams. See <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/clusterworld/0904GridFinal.pdf">Performance Tuning on GridFTP</a>.
<p>A rough heuristic guideline for the buffer  is as follows:
<pre>
        Distance between transfer sites         Recommended Buffer Size
                10 miles                           64 Kbytes (Default)
                100 miles                          0.5 MByte
                300 miles                          1.5 MByte
                1,000 miles                        5 MByte
                3,000 miles                        12 MByte
                10,000 miles                       25 MByte
</pre>
<p>Larger buffer sizes can be used, but these use additional TCP buffer space that may be limited on systems where many simultaneous transfers are occurring.

<p>Check out all the useful Globus components at <a href="www.globus.org/toolkit/">www.globus.org</a>. The Globus toolkit includes software for security, information infrastructure, resource management, data management, communication, fault detection, and portability. It is packaged as a set of components that can be used either independently or together to develop applications. Every organization has unique modes of operation, and collaboration between multiple organizations is hindered by incompatibility of resources such as data archives, computers, and networks. The Globus Toolkit was conceived to remove obstacles that prevent seamless collaboration. Its core services, interfaces and protocols allow users to access remote resources as if they were located within their own machine room while simultaneously preserving local control over who can use resources and when.
