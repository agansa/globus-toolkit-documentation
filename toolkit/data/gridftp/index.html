<p>GridFTP-Lite is a light-weight GridFTP that uses a SSH based authentication
mechanism instead of Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI). Even though GSI
is quite powerful and provides single sign-on capabilities, it is quite complex
to setup and maintain. GridFTP-Lite can be used as a stand alone tool. You do
not need to install all of Globus to use GridFTP-Lite. If you want to install or
learn about the GSI based GridFTP, please visit <a
href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/">this page</a>
<ul>
<li>Typical performance improvements range an order of magnitude higher than FTP
and can jump to multiple orders of magnitude when <a href="advantage.html">striping
or cluster-to-cluster data movement</a> functionality is used.</li>
<li>GridFTP-Lite provides a scriptable command-line client (globus-url-copy), a highly extensible server, and a flexible set of development libraries for custom solutions. </li>
</ul>

<!--  <p>Check out all the useful GT components at <a href="/toolkit/">www.globus.org/toolkit/</a>. The Globus Toolkit 
    is packaged as a set of components that can be used either independently or together to develop Grid applications. It includes software for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>security,</li> 
    <li>information infrastructure,</li> 
    <li>resource management,</li> 
      <li>data management,</li> 
      <li>communication, </li>
    <li>fault detection, and </li>
    <li>portability.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>Every organization has unique modes of operation, and collaboration between multiple organizations is hindered when 
      resources such as data archives, computers, and networks are incompatible.  The Globus Toolkit was conceived 
      to remove obstacles that prevent seamless collaboration. Its core services, interfaces and protocols allow users to access remote 
      resources as if they were located within their own machine room while
      simultaneously preserving local control over who can use which resources
      and when.</p> -->
