<h1 class="first">GridFTP: Quickstart Guide for GridFTP-Lite (GridFTP using SSH
security)</h1>
<?php include_once( "includes/submenu.inc" ); ?>

<h2>GridFTP-Lite:</h2>
<p>
The Globus Toolkit's GridFTP code base has become the de facto standard for data
movement within Grid projects, and is in use in the vast majority of such
projects in the US and abroad. These projects appreciate GridFTP's integration
with the public key infrastructure (PKI)-based Grid Security Infrastructure
(GSI), as well as its implementation of the fast, efficient, and robust GridFTP
data transport protocol. Another important user community for GridFTP comprises
small application groups and researchers and they struggle due to challenges
inherent in configuring GSI. For this user community, GridFTP's reliance on GSI
can represent a time investment that is not justified, due to the associated
need to establish, configure, and manage an appropriate PKI. Thus, this
community has expressed a strong interest in seeing extensions to GridFTP that
would allow for alternative security solutions. Motivated by these requests, we
have developed what is called GridFTP-Lite that uses a SSH based authentication
mechanism. </p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<pre>
wget
http://www.globus.org/ftppub/latest-stable/gt-latest-stable-all-source-installer.tar.gz
tar xfz gt-latest-stable-all-source-installer.tar.gz
cd gt*-all-source-installer
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/to
make gridftp install
/*wait 10-20 minutes*/
</pre>

<h2>Configuring the server:</h2>
<pre>
% /path/to/install/to/setup/globus/setup-globus-gridftp-sshftp -server
</pre>

<p>
In the absence of root access, 
</p>

<pre>
% /path/to/install/to/setup/globus/setup-globus-gridftp-sshftp -server -nonroot
</pre>

<p>
The above command creates a file named 'sshftp' in '/etc/grid-security' (if run as root) or in '$HOME/.globus' (if run as nonroot). The default contents of the 'sshftp' file is shown below. The users can add commandline options and customize the GridFTP server by editing this file.
</p>

<pre>
	export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/install/to
	. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh

	#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=50000,50100

	$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -ssh
	# -data-interface <interface to force data connections>
</pre>
	
<p>
Note: There is no need to explicitly start the server.
</p>

<h2>Configuring the client (globus-url-copy):</h2>
<pre>
% /path/to/install/to/setup/globus/setup-globus-gridftp-sshftp
</pre>

<h2>Performing Transfers:</h2>
<pre>
% export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/install/to
% . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
% globus-url-copy -v file:/etc/group sshftp://127.0.0.1/tmp/group 
% globus-url-copy -list sshftp://127.0.0.1/tmp/
