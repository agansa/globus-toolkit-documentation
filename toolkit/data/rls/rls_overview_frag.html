          <p>The <i>replica

                  location service (RLS)</i> maintains and provides access to

                  mapping information from logical names for data items to target

                  names. These target names may represent physical locations

                  of data items, or an entry in the RLS may map to another level

          of logical naming for the data item. </p>

          <p>The

                RLS is intended to be one of a set of services for providing

                data replication management in grids. By itself, it does not

                guarantee consistency among replicated data or guarantee the

                uniqueness of filenames registered in the directory. The RLS

                is intended to be used by higher-level grid services that provide

          these functionalities. </p>

          <p>The

                Replica Location Service was co-developed by the Globus team

                and Work Package 2 of the <a href="http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/">DataGrid</a> project.
