</p><h1> Status
          and Plans for Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> 3.0  </h1>

<p>July 22, 2003</p>
<p>As part of
      an ongoing effort to improve the functionality of the Globus Toolkit<a href="#footnote1">*</a>,
      the Globus Project launched an R&amp;D program in 2001 aimed at creating
      a next- generation Globus Toolkit 3.0 (GT3) based on Open Grid Service
      Architecture (OGSA) mechanisms. In this fact sheet, we describe the implications
      of this evolution for current Globus Toolkit 2 (GT2) users and the current
      status and future plans for GT3. Because these plans will continue to evolve,
      interested users should periodically check <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/"> http://www.globus.org/toolkit/</a> for
      updates. Please send feedback to <a href="mailto:info@globus.org">info@globus.org</a>.A
      companion document, the &quot;GT3 FAQ&quot;, contains considerably more
      detail on many of the points mentioned here. The GT3 FAQ is available at <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/gt3-faq.html"> http://www.globus.org/toolkit/gt3-faq.html</a>.<b>Topics

<p><b><a name="facts">Important
          Things to Know about GT3</a></b>The intent behind GT3 is to deliver
          an open source implementation of OGSI, several OGSI-compliant services
          corresponding to familiar GT2 services, and the ability to create new
          OGSI-compliant services.GT3 provides the same set of major features
          as those found in GT2. Specifically, it includes software that provides
          Grid security (GSI), remote job submission and control (GRAM), high-performance
          secure data transfer (GridFTP), and consistent interfaces to system
          and service information (MDS). All of the components provided by the
          GT2 for building Grid infrastructures and for developing Grid applications
          remain available in GT3. The GT3 FAQ contains details about the operational
          environments supported by GT3 services.While the key services provided
          by GT3 are now presented via OGSI-compliant interfaces, and while these
          OGSI-compliant interfaces are implemented in Java, many services still
          have high-performance (and familiar) back-end implementations written
          in C. Existing GT2 configuration features (job manager interfaces,
          MDS information providers) are still supported. In some cases, OGSA
          makes these even easier to use. The GT3 FAQ explains more about how
          this applies to each GT3 service.The most important advantage of basing
          GT3 on OGSA is that it both leverages and provides additional support
          to industry standardization around Grid protocols, both in e-Business
          and in e-Science.OGSA&#39;s most striking technical contributions to
          the Globus Toolkit are in the area of extensibility and manageability.
          Previous versions of the Globus Toolkit came with a set of predefined
          services (GRAM, GRIS, GIIS, GridFTP). These services were largely independent
          of each other and had few common features (the notable exception being
          the Grid Security Infrastructure), so investments in developing, using,
          or managing one service made little or no contributions to developing,
          using, or managing other services. The OGSA architecture and OGSI infrastructure
          provide a common framework for Grid services, so developing new OGSI-compliant
          services (or specialized versions of existing services) is quite straightforward.
          Every OGSI- compliant service can be used and managed via common interfaces,
          so building systems and applications with OGSI-compliant services is
          much easier. The GT3 FAQ includes details on how to get started learning
          about Grid service development and how to contribute new Grid services
          to the Grid community or to the Globus Toolkit.</p>
<p><b><a name="GT2">Globus
          Toolkit--Now and in the Future</a></b></p>
<p>While GT3
      (released on 30 June 2003) is the current production version of the Globus
      Toolkit, we recognize that there is a large user community that has made
      major investments in the Globus Toolkit 2 code base.&nbsp; This community
      quite reasonably expects to see continued support and a reasonable migration
      path to GT3. We are committed to supporting this community as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>GT2
          Support:</b> The GT3 distribution includes a full set of components
          based on the GT 2.4 distribution.&nbsp; Though the GT2 components will
          be deprecated over time, support for individual components will continue
          based on community needs (subject as always to available resources.)
  <li><b>Migration:</b> GT3
        supports GRAM and GridFTP client API-level compatibility with GT2, thus
        allowing GT2 code to run with GT3 after relinking. In addition, GT2 and
        GT3 installations will be able to run simultaneously on the same resource
        (with limited interoperability), thus facilitating transition. We welcome
        suggestions for other ways of assisting with migration. 
  <li><b>Security
          Infrastructure:</b> GT3 will, like GT2, make use of X.509 certificates,
          thus preserving the community&#39;s investment in certificate authority
          rollouts for authentication.

<p><b><a name="Terminology">Terminology</a><i>OGSA</i></b> refers
      to the Open Grid Services Architecture described in <i> The Physiology
      of the Grid: An Open Grid Services Architecture for Distributed Systems
      Integration</i> by Foster, Kesselman, Nick, and Tuecke (<a href="http://www.globus.org/research/papers.html#OGSA">http://www.globus.org/research/papers.html#OGSA</a>).
      OGSA addresses architectural issues related to broadly interoperable Grid
      services.<b><i>OGSI</i></b> refers to the Open Grid Services Infrastructure,
      based on the <i> Grid Service Specification</i> (<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/draft-ggf-ogsi-gridservice-33_2003-06-27.pdf">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/draft-ggf-ogsi-gridservice-33_2003-06-27.pdf</a>).
      The GSSpec specifies the way in which a client interacts with a Grid service.
      OGSI software provides mandatory Grid service features, such as service
      invocation, lifetime management, a service data interface, and security
      interfaces that ensure a fundamental level of interoperability among all
      Grid services.<b><i>GT3-Security-Compatible</i></b> refers to a client
      or a service that understands the GT3 GSI proxy certificates. GT3-Security-Compatibility
      does not imply OGSI-Compliance. OGSI-Compliant Service refers to a service
      that is built using and conformant to the Grid Service Specification; the
      protocol of an OGSI-compliant service is described by WSDL. OGSI-Compliant
      Services are GT3-Security-Compatible.</p>
<p><b><i>OGSI-Compliant
          Client </i></b> refers to a client sending messages that are compliant
          to the WSDL definitions defined in the Grid Service Specification.
          This is typically done using a client proxy that is generated from
          the Service&#39;s WSDL. The client can be implemented in any language
          that understands the WSDL bindings exposed by the OGSI-Compliant Grid
          Service. If a client is OGSI-Compliant, GT3-Security- Compatibility
          is implied.</p>
