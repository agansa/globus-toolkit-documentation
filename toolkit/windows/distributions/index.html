      <P>
       A new Windows "Distribution" has been created specifically for those that need GSI only. 
       <br><br>
       A branch was created for this distribution immediately after the recent 4.0 Release of the Toolkit.
       Unlike previous Windows Releases, the source code has not been posted in a zip file. Instead
       the user gets it from a CVS branch.
       See the Release Notes here for instructions on downloading and building this Distribution.
       <br><br>
       Note that the older distributions were dropped from this page.
       <br><br>
       <br>
      </P>
