  <h1>Globus Toolkit&reg; 3.2 GSI Release Notes</h1>
  
  <p> Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) enables
    secure authentication and communication over an open network. GSI provides
    a number of useful services for Grids, including mutual authentication and
  single sign-on. </p>
  <p>The 3.2 release contains a slew
      of bug fixes and various improvements. Improvements of note are updated
      third party libraries, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support in Java,
      support for pluggable authorization in the GridFTP and Pre-WS GRAM components,
      SimpleCA and improved documentation. Also, the security component will
      no longer ship with the Globus CA certificate. Users requiring certificates
      for testing should take a look at the 
		<a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs/index.html">Globus Certificate Service</a> or <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/simple-ca.html">Simple
  CA</a>.</p>
  <h2>Improvements/Bug Details </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      CRL Support for Java GSI libraries 
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for authorization callouts. These callouts can be used
      to replace gridmap based authorization/mapping and to enforce
      finer grained authorization in the Pre-WS GRAM component. More
      information can be found <a
      href="http://www-unix.globus.org/security/callouts/">here </a> 
    </li>
    <li>
      OpenSSL has been upgraded to version 0.9.7. This release of
      OpenSSL changes the textual representation of certain
      certificate subject (DN) components. The components that are
      affected are USERID, which changed to UID, and Email, which
      changed to emailAddress.  This will require you to update your
      grid-mapfile and CA signing policy files for CAs whose
      certificate subject contains any of the affected components. See <a
      href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=575">bug 
      575 for details</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      grid-proxy-init now checks that the certificate and the private
      key match
    </li>
    <li>
      CRL checking for C GSI libraries now handles the lastUpdate field and
      no longer assumes that the nextUpdate field is always present,
      which means that CRLs without a nextUpdate field no longer cause
      an error and don't expire.
    </li>
    <li>
      The SimpleCA packages are now included in the standard
      distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Globus CA setup package is now no longer part of the
      distribution. Users requiring certificates for testing should
      take a look at the <a
      href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs">Globus Certificate Service
      </a> or Simple CA. <strong>Note that you will not be able to run
      grid-cert-request until you have installed a CA setup package
      </strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      CA setup packages (GCS and SimpleCA) are now non-interactive.
    </li>
    <li>
      grid-cert-renew has been removed from the distribution
    </li>
    <li>
      For grid services specific security changes please see the <a
        href="core_notes.html">core release notes </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The grid-default-ca utility has been added to the distribution
    </li>
    <li>
      Various minor API changes have been made (Proxy Core, Cert
      Utils, System Config)
    </li>
    <li>
