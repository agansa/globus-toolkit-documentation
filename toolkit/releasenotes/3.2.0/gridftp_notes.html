<h1>Globus Toolkit&reg; 3.2  GridFTP Release Notes</h1>
<p> GridFTP is a  Pre-WS component that provides a high-performance, secure,
  reliable data transfer protocol optimized for high-bandwidth wide-area networks.
  The GridFTP protocol is based on FTP, the highly-popular Internet file transfer
  protocol. </p>
<p>The 3.2 release includes contain important bug fixes and improvements on
existing functionality.&nbsp; Improvements include support for platform 
      independent, machine parseable, file info (MLST and MLSD commands), a new
checksum command (<font face="Courier New" size="2">cksm</font>), support for
the Unix <font face="Courier New" size="2">chmod</font> command, and support
for file globbing and directory moves, i.e. <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> is
no longer restricted to a single file. <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> also
now has command line options for all the equivalent client library functionality. </p>

<h3>Globus-url-copy Changes</h3>

New features/options are marked by **:

<pre>
 globus-url-copy [options] &lt;sourceURL&gt; &lt;destURL&gt;
 globus-url-copy [options] -f &lt;filename&gt;
 
** &lt;sourceURL&gt; may contain wildcard characters * ? and [ ] character ranges
 in the filename only.
** Any url specifying a directory must end with a forward slash '/'
 
** If &lt;sourceURL&gt; is a directory, all files within that directory will
 be copied.
** &lt;destURL&gt; must be a directory if multiple files are being copied.
 
** Note:  If the ftp server from the source url does not support the MLSD
        command, this client will attempt to transfer subdirectories as
        files, resulting in an error.  Recursion is not possible in this
        case, but you can use the -c (continue on errors) option in order
        to transfer the regular files from the top level directory.
        **GridFTP servers prior to version 1.17 (Globus Toolkit 3.2)
          do not support MLSD.
 
 OPTIONS
   -help | -usage
        Print help
   -version
        Print the version of this program
   -versions
        Print the versions of all modules that this program uses
   -c | -continue-on-error
        Do not die after any errors.  By default, program will exit after
        most errors.
   -a | -ascii
        Convert the file to/from ASCII format to/from local file format
   -b | -binary
        Do not apply any conversion to the files. *default*
** -f &lt;filename&gt;
        Read a list of url pairs from filename.  Each line should contain

        Blank lines and lines beginning with # will be ignored.
** -r | -recurse
        Copy files in subdirectories
** -fast
        Recommended when using GridFTP servers. Use MODE E for all data
        transfers, including reusing data channels between list and transfer
        operations.
** -q | -quiet 
        Suppress all output for successful operation
** -v | -verbose 
        Display urls being transferred
   -vb | -verbose-perf 
        During the transfer, display the number of bytes transferred
        and the transfer rate per second.  Show urls being transferred

        to stderr
** -rst | -restart

       The path portion of ftp urls will be interpereted as relative to the
       user's starting directory on the server.  By default, all paths are
       root-relative.  When this flag is set, the path portion of the ftp url
       must start with %2F if it designates a root-relative path.
   -s  &lt;subject&gt; | -subject &lt;subject&gt;
        Use this subject to match with both the source and dest servers
   -ss &lt;subject&gt; | -source-subject &lt;subject&gt;
