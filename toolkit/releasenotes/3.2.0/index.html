      <h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>
      <p>With this release comes the first phase of new and improved
        documentation for the Globus Toolkit. You can go to the documentation
        home page for GT3.2
        <a href="../../docs/3.2/index.html">here</a>. </p>
      <p> In this phase, we've</p>
      <ul>
        <li>set up the framework for the new documentation by creating areas
          for each technology and consistent guides within each (see <a href="../../docs/3.2/index.html">Globus
          Toolkit 3.2 Documentation</a> for more information.) 
        <li>created a comprehensive<a href="../../docs/3.2/installation/index.html"> Installation
            Guide</a>, the new starting point for
          anyone downloading the Globus Toolkit. </li>
        <li>created and updated content for many technologies. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an ongoing process. Where we were not
        able to create new content in time for the 3.2 release, we've linked
        to existing documentation or indicated the page is under construction.
        In future phases, we will update these pages further. We value user feedback;
        if you have any questions, comments or suggestions about using our online
        documentation, please feel free to send an email to: <a href="mailto:documentation@globus.org">documentation@globus.org</a></p>
      <h2><a name="terminology"></a>Terminology (Pre-WS and WS) </h2>
      <p>We've also introduced new terminology to describe two types of components
        in the Globus Toolkit: WS components and Pre-WS components. See the breakdown
      in the table below:</p>
      <table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr valign="top">
          <td width="76"><strong>Pre-WS</strong></td>
          <td width="123">pre-web services </td>
          <td width="405"><p>Components that use proprietary protocols for basic
            service interactions. Services and clients formerly distributed in GT2 are included in the
          3.2 distribution as pre-WS components. </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td><strong>WS</strong></td>
          <td>web services </td>
          <td><p>Components that use open standards-based protocols for basic service
            interactions. WS components in GT 3.2 comply with Version
          1.0 of the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI).</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
</table>
      <h2><A name=Core></A>Core</h2>
      <p>The WS Core component  shipped in the 3.2  release contains 
      important bug fixes and improvements on existing functionality. Changes
      include better deactivate semantics, a change in the persistent grid service
      programming model, changes to the security descriptor format, updated third
      party jars and more.</p>
	  <p>Further information can be found in the 
      <A href="core_notes.html">Core 
      release notes</A>. </p>
      <h2><A name=Common></A>Common</h2>
      <p>Error message reporting has been cleaned up.  Messages are much more
      concise and clear.  If a user is still uncertain about a message, they can
      obtain more information by setting the GLOBUS_ERROR_VERBOSE environment
      variable.
      </p>
      <h2><A name=Security></A>Security (GSI)</h2>
      <p>The GSI  component shipped in the 3.2  release contains a slew
      of bug fixes and various improvements. Improvements of note are updated
      third party libraries, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support in Java,
      support for pluggable authorization in the GridFTP and Pre-WS GRAM components,
      SimpleCA and improved documentation. Also, the security component will
      no longer ship with the Globus CA certificate. Users requiring certificates
      for testing should take a look at the 
		<a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs/index.html">Globus Certificate 
		Service</a> or <a href="../../docs/3.2/gsi/simple-ca.html">Simple
		CA</a>.</p>

      <h2><A name=CAS></A>CAS</h2>
      <p> Included in the GT 3.2  release is the first production release
        of the WS component, Community Authorization Service (CAS). CAS
        is an authorization system that allows for fine-grain (e.g. per file)
        access control of Grid Resources. GT 3.2  includes the CAS Grid Service,
        which allows for creating and administering rights, client tools and
        libraries for using CAS, and a CAS-enabled GridFTP service. More information
      on CAS can be found <a href="../../docs/3.2/cas/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>        This version of CAS uses the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language
        (SAML) standard. Users should be aware that RSA Security has identified
        four patents it believes could be relevant to implementing certain
        operational modes of the SAML specifications. The Globus Alliance has
        established a license agreement with RSA covering usage of SAML in
        the Globus Toolkit, however users who redistribute SAML-enabled portions
        of the Globus Toolkit or use SAML-enabled portions in their own applications
        should understand the issue and may want to obtain a royalty-free license
      from RSA. </p>
      <p>        For information regarding the patent claims and a royalty-free reciprocal
        license to the patents, see: <br>

	       <h2><A name=GridFTP></A>GridFTP</h2>
      The Pre-WS Globus Toolkit wuftpd-based 
      GridFTP server, its associated tools, and libraries in the 3.2  
      release contain important bug fixes and improvements on existing 
      functionality.&nbsp;
      <p>Improvements include support for platform 
      independent, machine parseable, file info (MLST and MLSD commands), a new 
      checksum command (<font face="Courier New" size="2">cksm</font>), support for the Unix 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">chmod</font> command, and support 
      for file globbing and directory moves, i.e. 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> is no longer 
      restricted to a single file. <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> also now has command line 
      options for all the equivalent client library functionality. </p>

              <h2><A name=RFT></A>RFT</h2>
              <p>The WS Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service 
      component in the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended 
      functionality. In particular, this version of RFT supports recursive directory
      copy between GridFTP servers that support MLSD/MLST features. </p>
		      <p>The schemas of the service have been reworked 
      which increased the scalability of service significantly. </p>
	  <p>A new service instance level option has been added that turns on data channel reuse if 
      your request consists of multiple transfers between same hosts which will 
      further enhance performance. </p>
	<p>A new command line client has been added, 
      which in addition to being able to submit transfer requests to service, 
      can also serve as notification sink. This allows one to display number of 
      transfers done/failed etc. </p>

      <h2><A name=RLS></A>RLS</h2>
      <p>The Pre-WS Replica Location Service (RLS) component in 
      the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended functionality.
				In 
      particular, this version of RLS supports the 
      deployment of a hierarchy of Replica Location Index (RLI) nodes. </p>
		<p>In past RLS versions, RLIs summarized mapping information from one or more Local 
      Replica Catalog (LRC) nodes.
				In the new version, an RLS can be configured 
      with an arbitrary hierarchy of RLI nodes, where each RLI summarizes state
      information for one or more lower-level LRC and/or RLI nodes. </p>
		<p>In addition, the following have been fixed:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Memory leak when LRC or RLI is updating RLIs that have been down for 
		extended periods</li>
		<li>Args reversed when limiting results when not using MySQL</li>
		<li>Typo in SQL that retrieves attribute values</li>
		<li>Bug 
		<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1495">1495</a> (typos in the code)</li>
		<li>Inconsistencies with <font face="Courier New" size="2">pkgdata</font>
		</li>
		<li>RLS hang when started up as RLI only</li>
		<li>Java API inconsistency (<font face="Courier New" size="2">RLSClient.RLI.rliList</font>

      <h2><A name=XIO></A>XIO</h2>

      <p>The  Globus XIO component is the new extensible input/output library
        for the Globus Toolkit®.  It provides all input and output functionality
      for the C code.</p>

      <p>Globus XIO will eventually replace the <code>globus_io</code>
      library completely. In the meantime, a portability layer is
      included with this release to enable legacy applications written to
      <code>globus_io</code> to still work; however it is recommended that
      future applications code straight to the <code>globus_xio</code>
      API. </p>

      <h2><A
      name=GRAM></A>GRAM</h2>

			<p>The Pre-WS and WS GRAM components
			in the GT 3.2  release
			   contain many important bug fixes and
			   improvements on existing
		functionality.</p>
			<p><strong>Improvements: </strong></p>
		    <ul>
	      <li>For the web service (WS) Managed Job Service (
	      <strong>MJS </strong>),
		we improved the following: <br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Faults are more easily internationalized. <br> <li>The
	  local scheduler scripts provide better error messages. <br>
	  <li>Instances are deactivated during periods of inactivity
	  in order
	    to increase scalability by reducing memory consumption. </li>
	</ul>
	      </li>
      </ul>
		    <ul>
	      <li>For the pre-WS JobManager, we applied a patch for bug <a
	      href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=802">802
	      </a> which
		enables an alternate method for job status detection
		for a user (this is used in Condor-G). <br>
	      <li>For both WS MJS and pre-WS JobManager, the local
	      scheduler
		scripts <br>
    have been improved to reduce the chance of errors due to NFS caching
    delays and increase scalability by reducing memory consumption. <br>
	      <li>The local scheduler scripts have been improved to
	      store job files in a unique job directory instead of the
	      gass cache. <br> <li>The WS GRAM components are now IPV6
	      compliant. <br> <li>For the managed-job-globusrun program,
	      we added these options: <br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The -deleg [full | limited] option indicates
		    limited
		      or full proxy delegation. <br>
		    <li>The -proxy [ &lt;file path&gt;] option selects
		      credentials to use for authentication. </li>
		  </ul>
	      </li>
      </ul>
		    <p><strong>Important bug fixes: </strong></p> <ul>
	      <li>For the WS MJS, we fixed: <br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>UHE GRIM credential lifetime to obey user
		    configuration. <br> <li>job recovery problems. <br>
		    </li>
		  </ul>
	      <li>For the WS GRAM compontents, we fixed UHE recovery
	      and automatic
		shutdown (due to inactivity) </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><A name=Information_Services></A>Index Services</h2>
      <p>The GT 3.2  release of the WS Index Services components contains
        bug fixes, performance and stability improvements, and a few new features.
        There has also been considerable reworking of Service Data Aggregation
        concepts into a component-based API to allow for a more flexible model
        handling multiple data aggregation strategies. As a result of these changes,
        the Index Service (and other services that incorporate the Aggregator
        components) can now aggregate service data from other services by using
      the ServiceGroup registration interfaces.</p>

        <p>The WS C Bindings component of the GT 3.2 release contains bug fixes,
      as well as added support for big numbers using the <code>xsd:integer </code> type. </p>
        <p>Since GT 3.0.x, a number of important bug fixes have been made, including fixes
for the <code>gt3_gram_client</code> library for multiple job submission,as well as a number
of fixes to memory handling in that library. </p>
      <p>Also, support for the Tru64 native compiler

      <p>pyGlobus provides a high-level object-oriented interface to the Globus
        Toolkit 2(r) libraries and related packages such as myProxy. pyGlobus
        includes a series of modules that provide access to the full functionality
        of the Pre-WS API while hiding much of the complexity. In addition,
        a number of servers and command line tools are provided, e.g., a GridFTP
        server, a GridFTP GUI client, <code>pyglobusrun</code>, and <code>pyglobus-url-copy</code>.
        This release of pyGlobus includes numbers bug fixes,many contributed
        by the Access Grid developers at ANL, and support for the new Globus
        XIO package. pyGlobus supports the rapid development of Pre-WS applications,
      and allows for easy integration with C/C++ and Fortran codes.</p>

      <h2><A name=TP></A>OGSA-DAI (Tech Preview)</h2>
      <p> Included in the GT 3.2  release is a tech preview of the Open Grid
        Services Architecture - Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI)
        software. OGSA-DAI aims to provide uniform methods for discovering, accessing
        and integrating heterogeneous data resources, primarily databases, on
        the Grid. An extensible activity framework allows developers to build
        project specific functionality in addition to the standard querying,
        database management, data delivery, transformation and compression activities
      provided. </p>

      <p>Officially supported databases are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MySQL 3.2.x / 4.0.x
        <li>DB2 8
        <li>Oracle 9
        <li>Xindice 1.0 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally - though not officially supported - most databases with
        JDBC, ODBC or XML:DB interfaces which support the SQL or XPath query
        languages can be published using OGSA-DAI. Supported data delivery methods
        include SOAP, GridFTP and HTTP(S) streams. </p>
      <p>New features for this release of OGSA-DAI (r3.1.1) include full message-level security support, a technical preview of the Java Client Toolkit
        API (to aid development of applications using OGSA-DAI), and prototypes
      of CSV and BinX file access functionality.</p>
