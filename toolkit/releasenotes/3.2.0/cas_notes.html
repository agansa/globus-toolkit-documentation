<h1>Globus Toolkit&reg; 3.2  CAS Release Notes</h1>
<p>The Community Authorization Service (CAS) is a new WS component that allows
  resource providers to specify course-grained access control policies in terms
  of communities as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control policy management
  to the community itself. Resource providers maintain ultimate authority over
  their resources but are spared day-to-day policy administration tasks (e.g.
  adding and deleting users, modifying user privileges.)</p>
<p>The following indicate changes since 3.2 Beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation has been added about CAS functionality in GridFTP; details about that implementation can be found <a href="../../docs/3.2/cas/admin/casenablegridftp.html">here</a>; other CAS documentation can be found
<a href="../../docs/3.2/cas/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs 1626 and 1666</li>
</ul>
</p>
