<h1>Globus Toolkit&reg; 3.2  RFT Release Notes</h1>
<p> The Reliable File Transfer Service (RFT) is a WS component that provides
  interfaces for controlling and monitoring third party file transfers using
  GridFTP servers. </p>
<p>The  3.2 
			   release contains bug fixes and extended functionality. In particular,
  this version of RFT supports recursive directory copy between GridFTP servers
  that support MLSD/MLST features.  
</p>
<p>The schemas of the service have been re-worked, which increased the scalability
  of service significantly.  
</p>
<p>A new service instance level option has been added that would turn on data channel reuse if your request consists of multiple transfers between same hosts, which would further enhance the performance.  
</p>
<p>A new command line client has been added which, in addition to being able to submit transfer requests to service, can also serve as 
a notification sink to display number of transfers done/failed, etc. 
</p>
