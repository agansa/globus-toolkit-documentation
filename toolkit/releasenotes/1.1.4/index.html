<p>These notes provide information about the platforms on which release 1.1.4
  has been tested, changes to the Globus Toolkit build and installation process,
  known deficiencies, and common problems. </p>

<h2>Purpose of Release 1.1.4</h2>
<p>Release 1.1.4 of the Globus Toolkit provides support for MPICH-G2, a new grid-enabled
  MPI implementation.&nbsp; Unless you intend to use MPICH-G2, we recommend that
  you use release 1.1.3 of the Globus Toolkit.</p>
<p>Globus installations prior to 1.1.3 should be upgraded to 1.1.4 in order to
  use MPICH-G2. Users of release 1.1.3 of the Globus Toolkit who wish to use
  MPICH-G2 should obtain the 1.1.4 release and re-install their client tools
  and development libraries. (Sites with existing 1.1.3 servers do not need to
  rebuild, reinstall, or redeploy Globus services to use MPICH-G2.)</p>
<h2>Tested Platforms</h2>
<p>Release 1.1.4 of the Globus Toolkit has been tested on the following platforms
  prior to release.</p>
<ul>
  <li>AIX 4.2.1 </li>
  <li>Red Hat Linux 6.1 </li>
  <li>IRIX 6.5</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in the 1.1.4 Release</h2>
<p>The MPICH-G2 release requires minor optimizations and bug fixes to the Globus
  data conversion library, globus_io library, and GRAM components. These changes
  are all backward-compatible with previous versions of the Globus Toolkit.&nbsp; There
  are no changes to Globus protocols or APIs.</p>
<p>There are no changes to the build/install/deploy process for release 1.1.4,
  or to the installed libraries, tools, or services.&nbsp; All documentation
  for the 1.1.3 release is equally appropriate for release 1.1.4.</p>
<h2>Known Deficiencies</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IRIX</strong></p>
  <p>When using 1.1.x releases of the Globus Toolkit on IRIX systems, the sproc_mpi
    and pthreads_mpi libraries are not built properly. We do not recommend using
    these libraries on IRIX at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Common Problems</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Interoperability with 1.1.2 and Earlier Releases</h3>
  <p>Systems on which Globus 1.1.2 or earlier are installed may not accept job
    submission requests from 1.1.3 or 1.1.4 software. The reason for this is
    that the Globus Certificate Authority now generates certificates of the form "/O=Grid/O=Globus",
    which is different from the earlier CA which used "/C=US/O=Globus". The old
    form of certificate is still accepted on 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 systems, but the
    new form is not recognized by 1.1.2 and earlier systems.</p>
  <p>To fix the problem, you must make sure that your 1.1.2 and earlier systems
    are configured to accept the new certificates. This is accomplished by editing
    your ca-signing-policy.conf file, and adding the new certificate form to
    the list of acceptable formats.<br>
    This file is located in the directory </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>$GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH/share/certificates/</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>HBM related log entries in globus-system.log</h3>
  <p>The default 1.1.3/1.1.4 installation does not include the HBM components,
    but does include "hooks" to use the components if they exist. So there will
    be benign log messages such as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"HBM local monitor or HBM configuration file not found."</p>
    <p>"Registration Skipped: globus-hbm-client-register not found."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>which can be safely ignored. If you install globus with the optional globus-install
    options "-- --enable-beta --enable-hbm" you will get HBM components in addition
    to the default component set, and these messages will no longer be logged.</p>
  <h3>"slapd died" log entries in globus-system.log</h3>
  <p>If you have setup a GIIS host and port in globus-setup, it is possible that
    the service will fail to start. In this case a "slapd died" log message will
    follow the attempted starts.</p>
  <p>The most common cause of this problem is users setting the GIIS port to
    one already in use by another system service or application. Either identify
    and disable the conflicting service, or setup a different port for GIIS.</p>
  <p>If the problem persists, try running the logged slapd command manually as
    the deployed 'globus' user to see what (if any) error messages are generated
    at startup.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"started /opt/globus/libexec/slapd -p PORT -d 1 \<br>
      -f /opt/globus/etc/grid-info-site-slapd.conf (pid PID)"</p>
    <p>"slapd (pid PID) died"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>try running the exact command found in the log file.</p>
  <h3>Multiple DNS domains in organization</h3>
  <p>The 1.1.3/1.1.4 GIIS has a very flexible configuration model. If you are
    trying to set up GIIS services for large organizations with multiple DNS
    domains, please contact the discuss@globus.org list for assistance.</p>
  <p>The default configuration will not be sufficient for such purposes.</p>
  <h3>Registrations rejected by GIIS service</h3>
  <p>If your 1.1.3/1.1.4 GIIS service is logging "registration rejected" messages
    in grid-info-system.log, you may either need to adjust your GRIS/GIIS configuration
    files for your unusual deployment scenario (see item 3 above), or you may
    have encountered a shell script incompatibility.</p>
  <p>The Bourne Shell script implementing part of the GIIS service relies on
    a shell programming feature that appears to function incompatibly on at least
    the BASH2 shell. This only affects unusual sites that do not have normal
    shells installed in /bin/sh.</p>
  <p>If you have unexplainable problems with registrations being rejected despite
    apparently coordinated GRIS grid-info-resource-register.conf and GIIS grid-info-site.conf
    settings, contact discuss@globus.org for information about a possible shell
    script patch against Globus version 1.1.3.</p>
