<h2>Changes in the 1.1.3 Release</h2>
<p>Release 1.1.3 introduces a number of important changes to the Globus Toolkit.
  Changes to the build and installation procedures are described in detail in
  the <a href="../../docs/1.1.3/globus_sag1.1.3.pdf">Globus Toolkit
  1.1.3 System Administration Guide</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The 1.1.3 release introduces a new model for deploying the MDS, in which
    each resource runs a local GRIS (Grid Resource Information Service).&nbsp; The
    GRIS is a specialized LDAP server. </li>
  <li>When running globus-setup, you may elect to deploy your own MDS GIIS (Grid
    Index Information Service).&nbsp; This service collects information from
    multiple GRIS services (see above) and allows it to be searched. We believe
    that most sites will want to setup a GIIS to serve as an organization-wide
    information service. </li>
  <li>The globus-setup procedure is now optional. The globus-setup procedure
    is only necessary in the following situations.
      <ul>
        <li>You wish to use the old MDS deployment model</li>
        <li>You wish to override the predefined defaults associated with the
          GRIS (e.g. port number used, etc.).</li>
        <li>You wish to specify a different CA for generating new certificates.</li>
        <li>You wish to deploy an organization-wide GIIS server.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The enrollment step in the install/deploy process has been eliminated.
    There is no longer a need to enroll your site with the GUSTO testbed. </li>
  <li>The number of deployed daemons has been reduced for most sites. </li>
  <li>OpenLDAP should be configured with the options:<br>
    --enable-slapd --enable-shell --disable-ldbm </li>
  <li>When running the globus-local-deploy command, you will be asked if you
    wish to register your site with the Globus Project. This registration is
    for informational purposes only. If you answer "yes" to this question, your
    site will be included in the Globus Project's list of installed sites. We
    ask sites to register with us so that we may better understand the size and
    composition of our user community and provide better service to you in the
    future. Your answer to this question does not affect the way your system
    operates in any way. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Known Deficiencies</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IRIX</strong></p>
  <p>When using the Globus Toolkit on IRIX systems, the sproc_mpi and pthreads_mpi
    libraries are not built properly. We do not recommend using these libraries
    on IRIX at this time. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Common Problems</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Interoperability with 1.1.2 and Earlier Releases</h3>
  <p>Systems on which Globus 1.1.2 or earlier are installed may not accept job
    submission requests from 1.1.3 software. The reason for this is that the
    Globus Certificate Authority now generates certificates of the form "/O=Grid/O=Globus",
    which is different from the earlier CA which used "/C=US/O=Globus". The old
    form of certificate is still accepted on 1.1.3 systems, but the new form
    is not recognized by 1.1.2 and earlier systems.</p>
  <p>To fix the problem, you must make sure that your 1.1.2 and earlier systems
    are configured to accept the new certificates. This is accomplished by editing
    your ca-signing-policy.conf file, and adding the new certificate form to
    the list of acceptable formats.<br>
    This file is located in the directory </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>$GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH/share/certificates/</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>HBM related log entries in globus-system.log</h3>
  <p>The default 1.1.3 installation does not include the HBM components, but
    does include "hooks" to use the components if they exist. So there will be
    benign log messages such as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"HBM local monitor or HBM configuration file not found."</p>
    <p>"Registration Skipped: globus-hbm-client-register not found."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>which can be safely ignored. If you install globus with the optional globus-install
    options "-- --enable-beta --enable-hbm" you will get HBM components in addition
    to the default component set, and these messages will no longer be logged.</p>
  <h3>"slapd died" log entries in globus-system.log</h3>
  <p>If you have setup a GIIS host and port in globus-setup, it is possible that
    the service will fail to start. In this case a "slapd died" log message will
    follow the attempted starts.</p>
  <p>The most common cause of this problem is users setting the GIIS port to
    one already in use by another system service or application. Either identify
    and disable the conflicting service, or setup a different port for GIIS.</p>
  <p>If the problem persists, try running the logged slapd command manually as
    the deployed 'globus' user to see what (if any) error messages are generated
    at startup.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"started /opt/globus/libexec/slapd -p PORT -d 1 \<br>
      -f /opt/globus/etc/grid-info-site-slapd.conf (pid PID)"</p>
    <p>"slapd (pid PID) died"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>try running the exact command found in the log file.</p>
  <h3>Multiple DNS domains in organization</h3>
  <p>The GIIS has a very flexible configuration model. If you are trying to setup
    GIIS services for large organizations with multiple DNS domains, please contact
    the discuss@globus.org list for assistance.</p>
  <p>The default configuration will not be sufficient for such purposes.</p>
  <h3>Registrations rejected by GIIS service</h3>
  <p>If your GIIS service is logging "registration rejected" messages in grid-info-system.log,
    you may either need to adjust your GRIS/GIIS configuration files for your
    unusual deployment scenario (see item 3 above), or you may have encountered
    a shell script incompatibility.</p>
  <p>The Bourne Shell script implementing part of the GIIS service relies on
    a shell programming feature that appears to function incompatibly on at least
    the BASH2 shell. This only affects unusual sites that do not have normal
    shells installed in /bin/sh.</p>
  <p>If you have unexplainable problems with registrations being rejected despite
    apparently coordinated GRIS grid-info-resource-register.conf and GIIS grid-info-site.conf
    settings, contact discuss@globus.org for information about a possible shell
    script patch against Globus version 1.1.3.</p>
