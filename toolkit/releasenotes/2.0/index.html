<h3><a name="datagrid">Data
          Grid Components</a></h3>
<p>The Globus
      Project has defined a set of deliverables for our current work on projects
      involving  Data Grids.
      These deliverables include a reliable data transfer protocol optimized
      for high-performance networks (GridFTP),
      a catalog service for keeping track of replicated files (Globus
      Replica Catalog), and a replica management service for managing files
      in a high-performance, wide-area, data storage environment (Globus
      Replica Management).</p>
 
<p>We have developed
      a reference implementation of the GridFTP protocol. This implementation
      includes a suite of libraries and tools that use the GridFTP protocol.
      This software can be used to implement systems and applications that incorporate
      high-performance data transfer capabilities.</p>
 
<p>Additionally,
      we have defined APIs for constructing and manipulating replica catalogs
      and for reliable replica management, libraries that implement these APIs,
      and tools to provide command line access to the libraries' features.</p>
 
<p>Specific new
      components include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GSI-enabled
          versions of ncftp client and wu-ftpd server</b><br>
    These tools have been patched to enable GSI authentication on their control
    channels. Additionally, the wu-ftpd server has been patched to add support
    for the GridFTP partial file transfer feature and the GridFTP parallel transfer
    feature.<br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus_ftp_control
          library</b><br>
    This C library contains the code that implements our GridFTP protocol. The
    API provides routines for managing GridFTP connections including both control
    channel and data channel support.<br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus_ftp_client
          library</b><br>
    This C library contains the code implementing our GridFTP client API. The
    API provides higher-level client features on top of the globus_ftp_control
    library (full file get, put, transfer, etc.). <br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus_gass_copy
          library</b><br>
    This C library implements our "GASS Copy" API, which allows data to be copied
    between a source and destination using any combination of GridFTP, HTTP,
    HTTPS, and local file I/O. <br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus-url-copy
          tool</b><br>
    This command line tool allows data to be copied between URLs, local files,
    and/or stdin/stdout. Recognized protocols in the URL are: http, https, ftp,
    gsiftp, and file. This tool also supports transfers using parallel data streams
    and partial file transfers.<br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus_replica_catalog
          library</b><br>
    This C library implements our "Globus Replica Catalog" API, which allows
    operations on an LDAP-based replica catalog. (Replica catalogs keep track
    of files within collections stored in multiple storage repositories.) <br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus_replica_management
          library</b><br>
    This C library implements our "Globus Replica Management" API, which allows
    the registration of files in a managed storage environment and subsequent
    replication operations on these files.<br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>globus-replica-catalog
          and globus-replica-management tools</b><br>
    These tools provide command-line access to the features in the gloubs_replica_catalog
    and globus_replica_management libraries. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="mds">MDS
          Components</a></h3>
 
<p>The <a href="../../docs/2.0/mds/">Monitoring
        and Discovery Service (MDS)</a> is the information services component
        of the Globus Toolkit. MDS 2.1 enhances the original implementation found
        in the 1.1.3 release of the Globus Toolkit with improvements in performance,
        security, reliability, and ease of extension.</p>
  
<p>Major <a href="../../docs/2.0/mds/NewFeatures.html">feature
        enhancements</a> include the following:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>High performance GIIS and GRIS<br>
    -&nbsp; Memory-based caching backends for GRIS and GIIS<br>
    -&nbsp; Efficient GRIS resource information providers </li>
  <li>Revised resource representation model<br>
    -&nbsp; New MDS schema files<br>
    -&nbsp; New GRIS information providers </li>
  <li>Support for GSI authentication and access
      control </li>
  <li>Integrated GRIS/GIIS server </li>
  <li>Newer versions of OpenLDAP and OpenSSL </li>
  <li>Support for the new Globus Toolkit 2.0 packaging
      model  </li>
</ul>
  
<h3><a name="gram">GRAM
          Components</a></h3>
 
<p>The <a href="../../gram/"> Globus
        Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM)</a> is the resource management component
        of the Globus Toolkit. GRAM 1.5 is an update to existing components in
        the Toolkit.</p>
 
<p>The major
      feature change in GRAM 1.5 vs. earlier versions is the addition of new
      GRAM protocol and API features to support more robust job submission and
      management capabilities. This technology was contributed to the Globus
      Toolkit by the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor Team</a> at
      the University of Wisconsin.</p>
 
<h3><a name="packaging">Packaging
          Technology</a></h3>
 
<p>The 2.0 release
      of the Globus Toolkit uses a packaging technology unlike the one used in
      previous releases.</p>
 
<p>Because Grid
      software and the Globus Toolkit mean different things to different people,
      the new packaging system for the Globus Toolkit includes features to support
      Grid builders, application developers, and end users.</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>We continue
        the Globus Project tradition of offering software that will run on a
        very wide variety of platforms and OS-level configurations. We provide
        a new "a la carte" mechanism for installing only the software components
        that you need. We provide binary distributions of components for popular
        platforms. We've improved the efficiency of compiling the software from
        source code. We now support the ability to easily relocate the Globus
        Toolkit <em>after</em> installation. We provide setup packages for individual
        software components (furthering the "a la carte" installation model),
        and the ability to distribute "preconfigured" software for organizations
        that need to standardize the configurations on all their systems. </li>
  <li>Our "patch-n-build" mechanism
        allows third-party software (like OpenLDAP, OpenSSL, SASL, etc.) to be
        redistributed with patches that automatically apply on installation,
        allowing up to keep up with third-party software development. </li>
</ul>
 
<p>The new Globus
      Toolkit packaging technology was co-developed by the Globus Project and
      the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing
      Applications</a>, and is heavily based on NCSA's Grid Packaging Toolkit
      (GPT).</p>
<h3><a name="security">Security
          Components</a></h3>
<p>A number of
      security enhancements have been made since the 1.1.3 release of the Globus
      Toolkit. These are now included in the 2.0 release and are described below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The GSI
        configuration files have been changed to allow CA information to be added
        and removed in a modular manner. </li>
  <li>Due to
        relaxed export controls, we now include the necessary code in the GSI
        (security components) to enable integrity and privacy features (data
        encryption) on authenticated communication channels. </li>
  <li>The most
        common security error messages are now clearer and more user-friendly. </li>
  <li>The user
        interface for grid-proxy-init has been improved. </li>
  <li>Numerous
        code changes have been made to the GSI to enable anticipated features
        in future versions of the Globus Toolkit, including restricted delegation
        and community authentication services. </li>
  <li>Numerous
        memory leaks in the GSSAPI and GAA code were eliminated. These leaks
        were identified by the INFN team in the EU DataGrid project. </li>
  <li>Numerous
        security changes were made to enhance compatibility with non-PKI GGSAPI
        implementations (specifically, Kerberos). These changes were contributed
        to the Globus Toolkit by the ASCI DRM team at Sandia National Laboratory. </li>
  <li>Changes
        were made to allow the GSI to be used with OpenSSL 0.9.6b. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="other">Other
          Improvements</a></h3>
<p>In addition
      to the above major development efforts, we have continued to make less
      extensive improvements to other components in the Globus Toolkit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Various
        changes were made (primarily in globus_io) to enhance support for MPICH-G2.
        These changes were contributed by the MPICH-G2 team at ANL and Northern
        Illinois University. </li>
  <li>Several
        changes were made to globus_io to provide features required by our Data
        Grid code. A new <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c/globus_io/html/index.html"> globus_io
        API</a> specification is available. </li>
</ul>
<p>This
        list is is very likely incomplete, as it was nearly 18 months between
        the release of version 1.1.3 and version 2.0 and some items have not
        been kept track of as well as others. If you are aware of other changes
        made since the 1.1.3 release, please send email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@globus.org">webmaster@globus.org</a>.</p>
