<h2>  <a name="Compatibility">Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>This
      release should be backwards compatible with the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release
in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2.2
        clients should be backwards compatible with 2.0 servers, <i>if they are
        not using functionality added in 2.2</i>.</li>
  <li> Clients
        from 2.0 <i>with updates</i> should be compatible with 2.2 servers.</li>
  <li> Clients
        from 2.0 <i>without updates</i> are not compatible with 2.2 servers.</li>
  <li> There
        is <i>no </i>binary compatibility between packages in 2.0 and 2.2</li>
  <li>    APIs
          should for the most part be backwards compatible at the source level, <i>though
  it should be noted that some APIs have been removed from the toolkit.</i> </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="gram">GRAM
            1.6</a></h3>
 
<p>GRAM
        changes include:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Non-blocking
          client functions: Needed for clients submitting a large number of jobs
          all at onceScheduler specific options: Different versions of scheduler
          backend scripts ban support different scheduler options.&nbsp; These
          supported options will be published to aid in client job submissions.File
          Staging: Staging of files into and out of a GRAM resource with a job
          submissionSeparate setup packages for each scheduler: Only a subset
          of schedulers are used at a site, they should only have to install
          the ones they use.&nbsp; This will also make it easier to create, modify
          and redistribute unique scheduler setup packages.Advanced Output Management:
          Provide the means to send standard output and error to multiple destinations.Proxy
          Refresh: Enhancements to allow the user's proxy on the service host
          to be refreshed (replaced) so that the job manager (and job) has valid
          user credentials. This allows for longer running jobs.Shared Library
          Support for the User's Job: Made enhancements to the job's environment
          so applications built shared will run properly</li>
  <li>Improved
          Documentation: Added doxygen documentation where appropriate, updated
          for above enhancements</li>
</ul>

<p>GSI
        changes include:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>A
          complete rewrite of functionality that used to be in the SSL Utils
          package has been added (deprecating the SSL Utils package)Code cleanup
          in GSSAPI and GSS Assist packages. The
          GSS Assist package now requires module activation/deactivation. The
          module name is GLOBUS_GSI_GSS_ASSIST_MODULE.Error
          messages now use the standard Globus Error FrameworkGSSAPI and GSS
          Assist documentation has been improved including new APIs documented
          with doxygen.Support for GSSAPI extensions availabe at:<br>

The ability to export a credential to a file by passing the minor status 0xdee0
to gss_inquire_cred was removed. Users of this hack should use gss_export_cred
instead.ca-signing-policy.conf has been deprecatedRunning
a service as a non root user now requires a personal grid-map file. This file
is searched for by first looking at the GRIDMAP environment variable followed
by looking for $HOME/.gridmap.Setting the X509_RUN_AS_SERVER variable is a no-op
in 2.2. Certificates are now searched for in the following order:
              <ul>

                    variablesService certificateHost certificateProxy certificate </li>

              </ul>
              The
              X509_CERT_FILE variable is a no-op in 2.2.Standardized
              service certificate locations. Service certs are now searched for
              in the following locations (in order):&nbsp;

<h3><a name="callback">Callback
            Spaces</a></h3>
 
<p>The
        addition of callback spaces is a fairly invisible change from a user's
        standpoint.&nbsp; Developers will be interested.</p>
 
<p>Callback
        spaces allow a library or application that requires non-threaded semantics
        to not worry about how it is linked.&nbsp; This provides some performance
        improvement since you can increase the number of threads servicing callbacks.&nbsp; There
        are now 3 types of callback spaces:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Non-threaded:
          Callbacks need to be explicitly polled forSerialized: A single thread</li>
  <li>Threaded:
          one or more threads</li>
</ul>
 
<p>With
        non-threaded builds, all spaces behave like a non-threaded space.&nbsp; With
        threaded builds, the default space (the one used if you ignore Callback
        Spaces) is a threaded space.&nbsp; However, by default, only one thread
        is used, so it behaves as a serialized space would.&nbsp; You can vary
        the number of threads used by the threaded space for callbacks by setting
        the GLOBUS_CALLBACK_POLLING_THREADS environment variable.&nbsp; Some
        libraries may not work with this set to anything other than 1.</p>
 
<p>For
        example, the application Autopilot must be threaded but it uses MPICH-G2
        which is not thread safe.&nbsp; Now, Autopilot can use a threaded callback
        space and MPICH-G2 can use a non-threaded one meeting the requirements
        of both pieces of software.&nbsp; Note, this requires unreleased (as
        of 9.23.02) modifications to the MPICH-G2 library.</p>
 
<h3><a name="gridftp">GridFTP
            and GASS Copy</a></h3>
 
<p>No new
        features but lots of bug fixes including:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Race
          condition bugsSecurity / Buffer Overflow issue fixedMost hanging problems
          fixed</li>
  <li>Other
          miscellaneous bug fixes</li>
</ul>
 
<h3><a name="gass">Globus
            GASS Cache</a></h3>
 
<p>Changes
        to the Globus GASS Cache include:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Changes
          to the APIA severe performance problem with multiple simultaneous job
          submissions has been fixed.&nbsp; The problem was that locking on the
          state file causing huge delays (it did not matter if you were requesting
          the same URL or not).&nbsp; It was fixed by using hashes of the URL
          to create directory names and then writing files to indicate state.</li>
  <li> globus-gass-cache
          program has additional utility functions.</li>
</ul>
 
<h3><a name="io">Globus
            IO</a></h3>
 
<p>Globus
        IO underwent modifications to support callback spaces.&nbsp; There were
        some new functions added.&nbsp; Existing function signatures did not
        change, but binary signatures did change, so a recompile is necessary.&nbsp; Event
        handling has been made more efficient and a possible deadlock situation
        in cancel has been resolved.</p>
