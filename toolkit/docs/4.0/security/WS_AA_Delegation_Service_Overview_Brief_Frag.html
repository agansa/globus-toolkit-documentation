The Delegation Service is a new component in Globus Toolkit version
4 to provide an exposed interface for delegation of credentials to a
host. This enables a single delegated credential to be shared across
multiple invocations of services on that host (e.g. it could be used
for multiple GRAM job submissions or across GRAM and RFT
submissions). It also provides for menas of credential renewal.
