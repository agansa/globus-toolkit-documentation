<section id="s-delegation-api"><title>Delegation Service API</title>
<para>The <constant>org.globus.delegation.DelegationUtil</constant> provides API
for users to be able to get the certificate chain exposed as resource
property, delegate to a service, refresh and register listeners.</para>

<section id="getCertChain"><title>To get certificate chain of delegation factory service</title>

	<para>
<screen>static X509Certificate[] getCertificateChainRP(String delegationUrl)</screen>
	</para>

<para> This takes the endpoint to Delegation Factory Service and queries
the <type>CertificateChain</type> resource property. The chain of
certificates is returned as an array of
<type>X509Certificate</type>. The client needs to delegate on the
first certificate on the returned chain.</para>

<section id="delegate"><title>To delegate</title>

<screen> public static EndpointReferenceType delegate(String delegationServiceUrl,
                                                 GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                                                 X509Certificate certificate,
                                                 int lifetime,
                                                 boolean fullDelegation,
                                                 ClientSecurityDescriptor desc)
</screen>

<para> This utility method is used to create the security token to
delegate using the <parameter>issuingCred</parameter> and <parameter>certificate</parameter>
parameter. The lifetime and type of the delegated credential created
is determined by <parameter>lifetime</parameter> and <parameter>fullDelegation</parameter>
parameters. The security token (delegated credential) thus created is
then stored in the delgation service specified by the
<parameter>delegationServiceUrl</parameter>. The client security descriptor determines
the authentication mechanism, protection and authorization type to
use.</para>

<para> The Endpoint Reference returned points to the delegated credential
and can be used by cohosted services (services in the same hosting
environment) to retrieve the delegated credential.</para>

</section>
<section id="refresh"><title>To refresh a delegated credential</title>

<screen> public static void refresh(GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                               X509Certificate certToSign,
                               int lifetime,
                               boolean fullDelegation,
                               ClientSecurityDescriptor desc,
                               EndpointReferenceType epr)</screen>

<para> This method can be used to refesh a delegated credential that is
referred to by <parameter>epr</parameter>. A new delegated credential is created using
<parameter>issuingCred</parameter>, <parameter>certTosIgn</parameter>, <parameter>lifetime</parameter> and
<parameter>fullDelegation</parameter>. The client security descriptor determines
the authentication mechanism, protection and authorization type to
use.</para>

</section>
<section id="registerListener"><title>To register listener</title>

<screen>static void
        registerDelegationListener(EndpointReferenceType epr,
                                   DelegationRefreshListener listener,
                                   Subject subject)</screen>

<para> This method registers the listener <parameter>listener</parameter> with the
delegation resource referenced by <parameter>epr</parameter>. The operation is
permitted only if the credentials in the subject object matches the
user who delegated the credential.</para>

<screen>static void
        registerDelegationListener(EndpointReferenceType epr,
                                   DelegationRefreshListener listener)</screen>

<para> This API has the same functionality as the previous one. But the
subject object is picked up from the property
<constant>org.globus.wsrf.security.Constants.PEER_SUBJECT</constant> in the
current message context. If the identity of the delegator of
credential matches the value of the property, then the operation is
permitted.</para>
