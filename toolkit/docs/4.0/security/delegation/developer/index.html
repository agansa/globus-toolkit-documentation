<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p> Delegation service provides interface for service developers to be able
to retrive a delegated credential, given the endpoint reference to the
credential resource. No remote interface is provided for this
functionality, but the access is through shared Java state. Also, the
component provides for utility API that can be used for developing
client side code to generate delegated credential and delegate it.</p>

<h2><a name="archdes"></a>Architecture and design overview</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This component offers an interface to accept a delegated
credential, which it exposes as WS-Resources identified by an EPR
which it returns to the delegator. It allows co-hosted services access
to those credentials through shared Java state.</p>

<p>The delegation service exposes it's public key as a
ResourceProperty. The public key of the DS is contained in a
certificate chain for the host system (either as the EEC or a Proxy
Certificate issued by the EEC), allowing the client to verify the
validity of the public key. Clients of the DS delegate by binding a
Proxy Certificate to the exposed public key, and then passing the
Proxy Certificate to the DS via its interface.</p>

<p>Additionally the component allows for renewal of delegated
credentials by the delegator. Other entities may subscribe in order to
receive notification of renewals, allowing them to obtain the renewed
credential.</p>

<p> This component has a Delegation Factory Service and Delegation
Service. The Delegation Factory service exposes its public key as
resource property. A delegate call on the factory, creates a resource
in Delegation Service that represents the delegated credential. The
delegate call returns a Endpoint Reference (EPR) that can be further
used to refresh the credentials.</p>

<p> The services that are interested in the credential, can register a
listener (an object that implements
<code>org.globus.delegation.DelegationRefreshListener</code>) with the
specific resource. This does not have a remote interface and hence
only services that are in the same hosting environment can register
interest. The credentials are pushed to the listener anytime a refresh
is done.</p>
<h3>Relationship to WS-Trust</h3>
<p>The Delegation service uses WS-Trust messages as described in the WS-Trust specification. However it should be noted that these messages are underspecified (the contents of the basic WS-Trust envelop are xsd:any) and the contents of these messages for the Delegation Services are simplistic and probably do not achieve the "spirit" intended by the specification.</p>
<h3>Normal Usage Patterns</h3>
<h4>Creation</h4>
<center>
  <img src="DelegationServiceCreate.gif" width="472" height="414" border="0" alt="">
</center>
<ol>
	<li>The client does a lookup on the Delegation Service (DS) for the Resource Property (RP) containing the certificate chain of the DS. To perform this lookup the client uses the EPR of the DS obtained from a RP of another application (e.g. GRAM, RFT) or some other OOB method.
	<ul>
	<li>This lookup is secured via transport-level security. The client and server mutually authenticate and authorize each other.  Messages are integrity protected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The client creates a proxy certificate binding public key of DS, obtained from certificate china in previous step, to a proxy identity of client.<ul>
	<li>Lifetime of proxy certificate defaults to lifetime of signing certificate (typically short-lived proxy)</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>The client sends the proxy certificate (and chain) to DS; EPR identifying delegation is returned to client for use in subsequent invocations of other services co-hosted with DS.<ul>
	<li>EPR uniquely identifies delegation</li>
	<li>Resource expires on proxy expiration</li>
	<li>An ACL is created for the Proxy Resource, which contains the identity of the credential delegator.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4>Refresh</h4>
<center>
  <img src="DelegationServiceRefresh.gif" width="660" height="414" border="0" alt="">
</center>
<p>The original delegator of a credential may refresh the credential (i.e. replace it with a credential with a different credential, presumably one that has an expiration date later in the future). The usage pattern for this method is identical to the Creation method described in the previous section, with the exception that the EPR of the previously created Delegation Resource is used as opposed to the EPR of the Delegation Service.</p>
<h3>Credential Storage</h3>
<p>The Delegation Service uses a standard Grid service credential, namely a private key and certificate chain where the EEC has a DN containing the FQDN of the host on which the Delegation Service is running. The private key and certificate chain are stored on local disk, protected by local file system permissions (in PEM file in /etc/grid-security/containercert.pem).</p>
<p>When a delegated proxy credential is persisted to disk, it is stored as a serialized JAVA object in ~globus/.globus/persisted/{ip addr}/DelegationResource/. The private key of the Delegation Service is stored with the delegated proxy certificate to ease use of the delegated credential by services in the hosting environment.</p>
<h3>Access to Delegated Proxy Resources</h3>
<p>After delegating a credential to the Delegation Service, a client will typically invoke an application service (e.g. GRAM, RFT) that requires the use of such a delegated credential. In such situations, the client will pass the EPR of the delegated credential to the service which it is invoking.</p>
<p>The service will use an internal hosting environment API (as opposed to a web services method) to access the delegated credential. This interface provides the identity of the requesting client to the underlying software, which verifies that the client identity is present in the ACL of the proxy resource before returning the requested credential.</p>
<h4>Registration for Renewal Events</h4>
<p>Services internal to the hosting environment can register with a resource proxy to receive updated credentials when they renewed by the client. Such registrations are authorized in the same manner as direct access to the proxy.  Registered client will have any renewed credentials pushed to them.</p>
<h2><a name="pubinterfaces"></a>Public interface</h2>
<p>The semantics and syntax of the APIs and WSDL for the component, along with
  descriptions of domain-specific structured interface data, can be found in
  the <a href="../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
  guide</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Usage scenarios</h2>

<h3> Client-side scenario </h3>

<ul> 

<li> Prior to delegating, the client needs to get information about
the public key of the Delegation Facory service, to be able to
delegate on that. A utility API to do that is described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#getCertChain">here</a>.

<li> Once the delegation client has the public key of delegation
factory service it needs to create a delegated credential on that and then use
the remote interface on the factory and delegate the credential. A utility
API to do all of the above is described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#delegate">here</a>. The
Endpoint Reference that is returned by this operation can be
distributed to services that the user would like to delegate its
rights to.

<li> The user may need to refresh the delegated credential. The onus
is on the user to do this prior to expiration of the delegated
credential. If the user does not refresh the credential the expired 
credential will be garbage collected and the Endpoint Reference cannot 
be reused. A API that can be used to refresh is described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#refresh">here</a>

</ul>

<h3> Service-side scenario </h3>

<p> This section describes the usage scenario where some service is provided with a delegated credential EPR and needs to access the credential. Typically, as a part of application the delegated credential EPR is sent to the service and and it is assumed that the delegation service is cohosted (that is runs in the same hosting environment).</p>

<p> The service need to create a listener object that implements
<code>org.globus.delegation.DelegationRefreshListener</code>
interface. When the listener is registered, the service checks to
ensure that delegator idenity matches either the identity set in the
subject object that is set as part of API or is the peer subject in
the current message context. Details about the API are described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#registerListener">here</a>.</p>

<p> Upon registering the listener, the delegated credential is set on
the listener. Any time the credential is refreshed, it is set on the
listener.</p>
