  <title>Configuration overview</title>
  <para>The security settings for Delegation Factory Service and Delegation
Service can be configured by modifying the security descriptors. 
The descriptors allow for configuring  the credentials that will be used by the
services,   the type of authentication and message protection required as well as the authorization mechanism.</para>
  <para>By default, the following configuration is installed:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Delegation Factory Service:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>Credentials are determined by the container level security descriptor. If there is no container level security descriptor or if it does not specify what credentials to use then default credentials are used.</simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>Authentication and message integrity protection is enforced for the <function>requestSecurityToken</function> operation. Other operations do not require authentication. This means that you may use any of GSI Transport, GSI Secure Message or GSI Secure Conversation when invoking the <function>requestSecurityToken</function> operation on the delegation factory service.</simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>Access is authorized using the gridmap mechanism and no gridmap is configured in the service by default. If a gridmap is configured in the container level security descriptor, it is used. To configure a gridmap file for this service, refer to instructions in the next section.</simpara>

            <simpara>Credentials are determined by the container level security descriptor. If there is no container level security descriptor or if it does not specify what credentials to use then default credentials are used.</simpara>

          <listitem>
            <simpara>Authentication and message integrity protection is enforced for all operations. This means that you may use any of GSI Transport, GSI Secure Message or GSI Secure Conversation when interacting with the delegation service.</simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>Access to resources managed by the Delegation Service is managed using the gridmap mechanism. The gridmap used is resource specific and is populated with the subject of the client that originally created the resource.</simpara>

  <note>
    <para>Changing required authentication and authorization
  methods will require corresponding changes to the clients that contact this
  service. </para>

  <para>To alter security descriptor configuration refer to <ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/security/authzframe/security_descriptor.html">Security Descriptors</ulink>.</para>
  <para>To alter the security configuration  of the Delegation Factory Service,
edit the file
<filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_delegation_service/factory-security-config.xml</filename>. <note>
      <para>To either  specify a gridmap file different from the container level configuration or add one if the container security descriptor does not specify one, the following needs to be added to the Delegation Factory security descriptor.<screen>&lt;securityConfig xmlns=&quot;http://www.globus.org&quot;&gt;
           .
           .
           .
