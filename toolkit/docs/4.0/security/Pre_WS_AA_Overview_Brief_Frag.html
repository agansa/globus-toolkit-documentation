The Globus Toolkit pre-Web Services authentication and authorization
component allows for the authentication of users and services using
X.509 End Entity certificates as well as allow for delegation using
X.509 Proxy Certificates. The authorization callouts enable the
ability to perform access control based on the client credentials
(i.e. the X.509 certificate chain), customize gridmap lookup
(currently available in the Gatekeeper and GridFTP servers), and
performing fine-grained authorization in the GRAM Jobmanager.
