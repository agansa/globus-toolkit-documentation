<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document contains information about deploying a CAS server
	and is not needed for a CAS client installation.</p>

<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>
<p>The CAS server is built and installed as part of a normal GT4
	installation.</p>

<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring </h2>

<p>Information on configuration settings and environment variables can be found
  in the <a href="../WS_AA_CAS_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface guide</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="deploying"></a>Deploying</h2>
<h3> <a name="casCreds">Obtaining credentials for CAS server </a> </h3>

<p> The CAS service could run with its own set of credentials. Instructions
 to obtain service credentials may be found <a
 href="http://www.globus.org/gt2.2/admin/guide-verify.html#ldapcert">here</a>.

 <p> The standard administrator clients that come with the
 distribution can be used to perform host authorization and expect
 that the CAS service have credentials that have service name
 "cas". The command in the above mentioned webpage maybe altered as
 follows,
   
<pre>  casadmin$ grid-cert-request -service <i>cas</i> -host <i>FQDN</i><br></pre>
      
<p> These the certificate and private key are typically placed in
<i>/etc/grid-security/cas-cert.pem</i>
and <i>/etc/grid-security/cas-key.pem</i>, resepectively. In this
document, the location of certificate and key files is referred to as
CAS_CERT_FILE and CAS_KEY_FILE respectively.

<h3><a name="dbInstall">Database Install and Configuration </a> </h3>
  
CAS uses a backend database to store all user data. Any JDBC compliant
database may be used. This section describes briefly the installation
of such a database and the creation of database using schema required
for CAS backend.

<h4> Installing the Database </h4>

Any JDBC compliant database may be used. PostgreSQL has been used for
development and testing. The drivers for the same are included in the
distribution. If a different database is used, the corresponding
driver should be added to GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib

<p> Brief instructions to install a JDBC compliant database and
specifically PostGres can be found <a
href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.0/ogsa/docs/admin/installation.html">here</a>. For more detailed instructions, please refer to specific database
documentation.

<h4> Initializing the CAS database </h4>

<p> The schema of the database that needs to be created for CAS can be
 found at <code> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/globus_cas_service/casDbSchema/cas_pgsql_database_schema.sql</code></p>
   
<p> To create a database, for example <i>casDatabase</i>, on a PostgreSQL
install on local machine,
    
<pre>  casadmin$ createdb casDatabase <br>  casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/globus_cas_service/casDbSchema/cas_pgsql_database_schema.sql</pre>
</p>

<p> On running the above command, a list of notices will be seen on
the screen. Unless any of them say "ERROR", these are just output for
information.</p>

<p>Information about the database needs to be configured for CAS
service to be able to use it. That information is described <a
href="./../WS_AA_CAS_Public_Interface.html#config">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>

<p> CAS has two sets of tests, one for the backend database access
module and another set to test the service itself. To install both
tests, the CAS test package
(<i>gt4-cas-delegation-test-3.9-src_bundle.tar.gz</i>) needs to be
installed using GPT <b>FILLME: instructions </b> into
<i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i>.</p>

<p> It is assumed thet a backend database has been set up and
configured and that CAS service and tests are installed in
<i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</i>. The sample commands assume that the service
is running on localhost and port 8080, and that the database is set up
with a) username as tester, b) database name as casDatabase, c) host as
foo.bar.gov and default port.</p>

<ul>
<li> Testing backend database module
<ul>
<li> cd $GLOBUS_LOCATION
<li> The file <i>etc/globus_cas_unit_test/casTestProperties</i> needs to be populated with database configuration information.

<a name="testDbConfig"></a><table>
<tr><td>dbDriver </td><td> The JDBC driver to be used</td></tr>
<tr><td>dbConnectionURL </td><td> JDBC connection url to be used to connect to database</td></tr>
<tr><td>dbUsername </td><td> user name to connect to database as</td></tr>
<tr><td>dbPassword </td><td> database password for the said username </td></tr>
</table>

<li> The database needs to be empty for these tests to work. To delete
all the data in the database the following can be used:

<pre>psql -d casDatabase -U tester -h foo.bar.gov -f etc/globus_cas_utils/database_delete.sql </pre>
<li> ant -f share/globus_cas_unit_test/cas-test-build.xml testDatabase
<li> Test reports are palced in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_cas_unit_test/cas-test-reports
</ul>
<li> Testing CAS service module

<p> These tests can be set up so as to be able to test multiple user
scenario or it can be configured to run just as a single identity. The first set of tests are used to test admin functionality and sets up the database for second user. As the second user the permissions and queries are tested to ensure that the set up worked.</p>

<p> All the configuraiton information for the test, needs to be
configured in
<i>etc/globus_cas_unit_test/casTestProperties</i> file. The database
section of the properties file needs to be configured as described <a
href="testDbConfig">here</a>. Other than those, the following
properties also need to be configured for these tests:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>user1SubjectDN</td><td> The DN of the user running the first
set of tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>user2SubjectDN</td><td> The DN of the user running the second
set of tests. Can be the same as previous property</td></tr>
<tr><td>maxAssertionLifetime</td><td> Should match the value set in
service configuration as shown in <a
href="./../WS_AA_CAS_Public_Interfaces.html#config">Configuration
information</a></td></tr> </table>

<p> Steps for testing:</p>

<ol>
<li> cd $GLOBUS_LOCATION

<li> The database needs to be empty for these tests to work. To delete
all the data in the database the following can be used:

<pre>psql -d casDatabase -U tester -h foo.bar.gov -f etc/globus_cas_utils/database_delete.sql </pre>

<li> In the test properties file, set <i>user2SubjectDN</i> to be the
subject in your regular proxy. The following returns the appropriate
string

<pre>  casadmin$ bin\grid-cert-info -subject -globus</pre>

<li> Generated an independent proxy using the following command. 
    
<pre>  casadmin$ bin\grid-proxy-init -independent<br></pre>

<li> Set the identity in the proxy generated from the above step as
<i>user1SubjectDN</i> in the test properties file. The following
command will return the relevant string.

<pre>  casadmin$ java org.globus.tools.ProxyInfo -subject -globus</pre>

<li> Start a container on port, say testPort and host, hostPort.

<li> The following command, runs tests for self permissions and sets up the database for user with subjectDN that is user2SubjectDN. 
            
<pre>  casadmin$ ant -f share/globus_cas_unit_test/cas-test-build.xml -Dtest.port=testPort -Dtest.host=testHost user1TestService</pre>

<li> To test as the second user, generate proxy for the subject DN specified for the second user.

    <pre>  casadmin$ bin/grid-proxy-init <br></pre></li>

<li> To test as second user, run the following. If you are not running container on default host/port, set properties as shown <a href="#testParams">here.</a>

    <pre>  casadmin$ ant -f share/globus_cas_unit_test/cas-test-build.xml -Dtest.port=testPort -Dtest.host=testHost user2TestService</pre>

<li> Test reports are palced in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_cas_unit_test/cas-test-reports

<li>After these tests, the CAS database needs to be reset. The following
command will delete all entries from the database.

<pre> casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/database_delete.sql<br></pre>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="admin-example">Example of CAS Server Administration</a>
</h2>

The following contains an example of administering the CAS server
policies using the CAS administrative clients described in XXX link
to CommandLine Frag
<p>

Alice, Bob and Carol are three members of a community who have set up
a Community Authorization service. Alice's role is primary to
administer the CAS server. Bob is an analyst who needs read access to
much of the community data. Carol is a scientist who needs to be able
to both read and write community data.

<p>These examples show how Alice adds the users Bob and Carol to the CAS
server, then adds a ftp server with some data available to the
community and then add permissions for the users using the cas
administration clients.

<p>These examples assume that Alice has installed the CAS server and
bootstrap the database with herself as super user. Please refer to <a
href="./installGuide.html">installation documentation</a> for details. 

<p> Assume Alice's nickname on the CAS server is <i>alice</i> and at
bootstrap has created a user group <i>suGroup</i>,which has super user
permissions on the database. Say, the CAS serivce URL is

<i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i>

<p>All commands listed below assume that enviroment variable
GLOBUS_LOCATION has been set to point to the GT3 core install and that
the commands are run ftom GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. Also, say an environment
variable CAS_SERVER_URL has been set to point to the CAS server URL,
<i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i>
<p>
<b>1. Adding a user group </b>

<p> Since at the time of booting up the CAS server, only one user
group that has super user permissions on the CAS server is created,
Alice might want to create another user group to which new users maybe
added and permissions to newly enrolled CAS entities may be
given. This also eases the process of giving same rights to many
users.Given they are two types of roles in the community she might
want to create two groups, <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>.


<p>Also, all permissions on the newly created group will be given to
users of a particular user group. Say, Alice would like all users of
the user group <i>analysts</i> to be able to manipulate the group.

<p>To create a new user group Alice uses the <i>cas-group-admin</i>
client.It requires a name for the new group being created, say
<i>analysts</i>. 

<pre>
alice%  cas-group-admin user create analysts analysts
</pre>

This will create a user group <i>analysts</i> and give all users in
that group the permission to manage the group (i.e add users, remove
users and so on).

She can similarly create a group called <i>scientist</i>

<p>
<b>2. Adding trust anchor.</b>

<p>
Prior to adding Bob and Carol to CAS server, Alice needs to ensure
that the trust anchors for both have been added. If they share the
same trust anchor with Alice then this can be skipped, since at
bootstrap Alice's trust anchor would have been added to the database. 

<p>Say, Alice and Carol share a trust anchor different from
Bobs's. Then Alice needs to add the trust anchor used by Bob by using
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>trustAnchor</i> option.  She
needs to provide details about the trust anchor such as the
authentication method and authentication data used.

<pre>
alice%  cas-enroll trustAnchor analysts AbcTrust X509 "/C=US/O=some/CN=ABC CA"
</pre>

The above will enroll a trust anchor with nickname <i>AbcTrust</i>,
who uses <i>X509</i> as authentication method and has the DN specified
in the command. The members of the <i>analysts</i> user group are
given all rights on this object. This implies that any user who has
this trust anchor, would present credentials signed by this trust
anchor.

<p>
<b>3. Adding users.</b>
<p>

Now, Alice can add Bob and Carol as users using the <i>cas-enroll</i>

command with the <i>user</i> option. She needs to provide the user's
subject DN and reference to trust anchor used by the user. As with any
entity added to the CAS server, a user group whose members will have
all permissions on that entity needs to be chosen. Say, Alice would
like the members of user group <i>suUser</i> to be able to
maninipulate the user entity <i>Bob</i>.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll user suUser bob "/O=Our Community/CN=Bob Foo" AbcTrust
</pre>

Alice uses a simliar command to add Carol to the CAS database.

<p>
<b>4. Adding users to user group.</b>

<p>CAS server allows rights to be assigned only to user groups and not
to individual users. Hence before Alice can assign rights to Bob or
Carol, she needs to add them to some user group. She does this by
using <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> client with the <i>user</i> option to
indicate she is adding to a user group. This client requires the group
name and nick name of the user who needs to be added. So to add Bob to
<i>analysts</i> group, the command would be,

<pre>
alice% cas-group-add-entry user analysts bob
</pre>

<p>If a user group <i>scientists</i> was created, Carol can be added
as a member similarly.


<p>
<b>4. Adding a new FTP server.</b>

<p>Alice now has the community users in the database and
organized. She now wants to add some resources. The community
currently has a single ftp server, foo.bar.edu, available to it, so
she is going to add this to the CAS database.

<p>Each resource or object in the CAS server has a namespace
associated to it that defines some features like the comparison
algorithm that needs to be used when this object name is used for
comparison and maybe the base URL that should be prefixed to objects
that belong to this namespace. In this case, Alice can chooses to use
<i>FTPDirectoryTree</i> namespace that is added to the CAS server at
bootup.

Now, she adds the ftp server to the CAS database, using the
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>object</i> option.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/* FTPDirectoryTree

</pre>

This adds the ftp server as an object and gives all members of the
<i>suGroup</i> rights to manipulate the object.

<p> To be able to grant/revoke access on indiviual directories,
objects with the directory. Say, if Alice would like to be able to
manipulate the <i>data</i> on the server as a separate entity, the the
following will add an object for that.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/* FTPDirectoryTree
</pre>

<p>
<b>4. Creating an object group </b>

<p>
Alice suspects the community will end up have more directories
containing data on other servers that will have identical polices as
the /data directory on foo.bar.edu. So she is going to create an
object group called <i>data</i> and assign foo.bar.edu/data to this
group. This will allow her to grant rights on this group and easily
add other directories to this group later

<p>To create a group called <i>data</i> she uses the
<i>cas-group-admin</i> client with <i>group</i> and <i>create</i>

option.

<pre>
alice% cas-group-admin object create suGroup data
</pre>

This creates an object group called <i>data</i> and the members of
<i>suGroup</i> get all rights on this group and hence should be able
to add/remove members, grant rights to add/delete from this group to
others and also delete this group.

<p>
<b>5. Adding members to object group </b>
<p>

Alice now can add foo.bar.edu/data to the <i>data</i> group. She can
do this by using the <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> with the <i>object</i>
option. To add the above described object,
<i>ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*</i> in namespace <i>FooFTPNamespace</i>,
to object group <i>data</i>, the following would be the command.


<pre>
alice% cas-group-add-entry object data object FooFTPNamespace ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*
</pre>

In the above command, the first <i>object</i> refers to the group
type, <i>data</i> is the name of the object group, <i>object</i>
refers to the type of CAS entity that is being added as memeber and
the last two parameters define the namespace and the object that needs
to be added.

<p>
<b>6. Adding service types </b>

<p>
Alice now needs to add information about the kind of rights that can
be granted for these objects. These are stored as <i>service types</i>
and relevant actions are mapped to these service types.

<p>In this scenario, the kind of service types that Alice should add
would be <i>file</i>, <i>directory</i> and so on. To do so, the
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with <i>serviceType</i> option maybe used. To
add a service type called <i>file</i> and give members of

<i>suGroup</i> all rights on this service type, she uses the following
command.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll serviceType suGroup file
</pre>

<p>
<b>7. Adding action mappings </b>
<p>
The relevant action mappings to the above mentioned service types
would be <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> and so on. Alice needs to add these
mappings to the database so that she can grant rights that allow a
user to have <i>file/read</i> or <i>file/write</i> permissions on some
object.


<p> To add action mappings to a service type, she uses the
<i>cas-action</i> client with <i>add</i> option. The following command
should add a mapping of action <i>read</i> to service type
<i>file</i>.

<pre>
alice% cas-action add file add
</pre>

Similarly she can add other mapping like <i>write</i> to this service type.

<p>
<b>8. Grant permissions. </b>
<p>
Alice now has resources in the object group <i>data</i> and users in the
user groups <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>. She now wants to grant
permissions on <i>data</i> group to the analysts and scientists, namely
read permissions to the analysts and read and write permissions to the
scientists.


<p> To grant permissions the <i>cas-rights-admin</i> with the
<i>grant</i> option needs to be used. To give read permissions to the
analysts group, the command that needs to be run would be

<pre>
alice% cas-rights-admin grant analysts objectGroup data serviceAction file read</pre>

She similarly grants rights to <i>scientists</i> group.
