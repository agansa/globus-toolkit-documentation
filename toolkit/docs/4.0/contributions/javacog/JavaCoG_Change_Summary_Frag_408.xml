    <title>GridFTP Control Channel DNS-RR support</title>
    <para>
        Modified GridFTP control channel so that it will attempt to
        connect to all IPs returned in a DNS lookup.  This is useful
        for cases where many IPs are associated with one hostname and
        one of the IPs returned points to a down machine.  This is the
        accepted TCP methodology.

        A timeout associated with each IP can be controlled with the
        org.globus.ftp.openTO property, and the number of hosts to
        try is controlled by org.globus.ftp.DNSRRHostsToTry.

    <title>Clean up sockets on garbage collection</title>
    <para>
        Added code to clean up socket connections in the finalize() mentod
        of FTPClient and the constructor of GridFTPClient.  This will prevent
        possible FD leaks observed by some user communites.

        API uses should explicitly call close in all cases, but this 
        change should help they out in case they do not.
