  <title>Permissions of proxy files</title>
  <para>
    Since Java does not provide API for setting permissions of a file, the Java CoG Kit will attempt to execute <computeroutput>/bin/chmod</computeroutput> program in the background to set the permission of the given file. If that program cannot be executed for any reason or fails to execute, a proxy file might end up with incorrect file permissions (depending on <computeroutput>umask</computeroutput> setting). Usually a warning will be displayed if that occurs (especially on Windows since <computeroutput>/bin/chmod</computeroutput> is not supported on that platform).
