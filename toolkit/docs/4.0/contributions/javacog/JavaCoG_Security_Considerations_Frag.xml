  <title>Functions that execute an external program</title>
  <para>
    Under some circumstances, the <computeroutput>org.globus.util.Util.setFilePermissions()</computeroutput> and the <computeroutput>org.globus.util.ConfigUtil.getUID()</computeroutput> functions execute an external program; thus, its behavior is influenced by environment variables such as the caller's PATH and the environment variables that control dynamic loading.  Care should be used if calling these functions from a program that will be run as a Unix setuid program, or in any other manner in which the owner of the Unix process does not completely control its runtime environment.

  <title>Permissions of proxy files</title>
  <para>
    Since Java does not provide an API for setting the permissions of a file, the JGlobus module will attempt to execute the <computeroutput>/bin/chmod</computeroutput> program in the background to set the permissions of the given file. If that program cannot be executed for any reason or fails to execute correctly, a proxy file might end up with incorrect file permissions (depending on <computeroutput>umask</computeroutput> setting). Usually a warning will be displayed if that occurs (especially on Windows since <computeroutput>/bin/chmod</computeroutput> is not supported on that platform).
