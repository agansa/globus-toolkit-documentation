<para>The Community Scheduler Framework 4.0 (CSF4.0) is a WSRF-compliant 
    Grid level meta-scheduling framework built upon the Globus&reg; Toolkit. 
    CSF provides interface and tools for Grid users to submit jobs, create advanced 
    reservations and define different scheduling policies at the Grid level. Using CSF, 
    Grid users are able to access different resource managers, such as LSF, PBS, 
    Condor and SGE, via a single interface.</para>
