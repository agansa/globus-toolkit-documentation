<para>Access authorization to the GridWay server is done based on the Unix identity of the user (accessing GridWay directly or through a Web Services GRAM, as in <ulink url="http://www.grid4utility.org">GridGateWay</ulink>). Hence, security in GridWay has the same implications as the unix accounts of their users.</para>
<para>Also, GridWay uses proxy certificates to use Globus services, so the security implications of managing certificates also must be taken into account</para>
