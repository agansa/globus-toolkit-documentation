The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing of
computing resources (clusters , computing farms, servers, supercomputers...),
managed by different LRM (Local Resource Management) systems, such as PBS, SGE,
LSF, Condor..., within a single organization (enterprise grid) or scattered
across several administrative domains (partner or supply-chain grid).

There exist a number of commercial and open source workload management and
scheduling systems available today, each one suitable for different underlying
computer infrastructures and execution profiles. GridWay stands out from other
metascheduling systems because it has been specifically designed to work on top
of Globus services, offering the highest functionality, quality of service and
reliability on this kind of infrastructures, namely:
