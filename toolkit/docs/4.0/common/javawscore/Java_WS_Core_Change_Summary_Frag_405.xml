  An API mechanism for optimized in-process service-to-service communication has been added.  This API consists primarly of a Java helper class: org.globus.wsrf.utils.LocalInvocationHelper.  Service developers can use this class to make function calls directly on service objects that are co-located within the same container process.  Subscription/Notification using local method invocation is also supported.  For additional information regarding the design and implementation of this mechanism, please see the following <ulink url="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Image:LocalInvocations.pdf">document</ulink> link.
