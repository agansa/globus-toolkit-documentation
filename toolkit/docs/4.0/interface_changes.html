    <td>Resynch w/Axis CVS to adopt the new Axis file naming convention for generated files</td>
    <td>Failure to adopt the new file naming conventions would mean that the Globus Alliance could not commit planned performance improvements to the Axis CVS and that GT would ship with a version of Axis that greatly differed from that in the Axis CVS. </td>
    <td style="color:green">Service developers will need to change all references to names of Axis-generated classes.<p style="color:green">The changes to the names are pretty straightforward: All underscores are dropped, the first letter of each word within the name is capitalized. If there are collisions between names, the name for the port type will end with _PortType and for the element with _Element.  Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>_foo.java -> Foo.java
<li>_Foo_Bar.java -> FooBar.java
<li>_GetMultipleResourceProperties.java ->
GetMultipleResourceProperties_Element.java
<li>GetMultipleResourceProperties.java ->
<li>GetMultipleResourceProperties_PortType.java
</ul>

(the same name collision rule applies to QueryResourceProperties and
SetResourceProperties)

Add a configuration option to manage behaviour of RFT Service when a MLST 
call to a GridFTP server fails. This will allow System Admins to configure RFT to transfer files between old GridFTP servers that don't suppor MLST. MLST is 
similar to doing 'ls -lt' on a command line.

that don't support MLST.
