<para>Users of GT2 RLS must create the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/data/rls/RLS_Glossary.html#rli">RLI</ulink> database, which was not required in some GT2 versions 
of RLS. To create the RLI database run the RLI database script for your particular DBMS. See the
    <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/data/rls/RLS_Build_Install.html#a-rls-Build_Install-rlsdbconfig">database configuration instructions</ulink> for more details. This is only required if the RLS
is deployed as an RLI (e.g., <command>rls_server <replaceable>true</replaceable></command>).</para>
