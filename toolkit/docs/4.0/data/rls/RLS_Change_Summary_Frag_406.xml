<para>The RLS is now built and installed as part of the default toolkit installation from both the source and binary distributions. The RLS now includes an embedded database as part of the installation. Following installation, the RLS will be fully configured to use the embedded database. For existing users of the RLS, the RLS installation may be configured to use a DBMS server as usual. In addition to the embedded database support, this release includes portability improvements for Mac OSX and AIX platforms.[FIXME]</para>
