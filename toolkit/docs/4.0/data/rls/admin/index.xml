    <para>Starting with GT version 4.0.5, the RLS is now built and installed as part of a default GT installation. The only extra installation step required for this component is to set the <computeroutput>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</computeroutput> prior to installation. For detailed instructions on building and installing RLS, see <xref linkend="a-rls-Build_Install"/>.</para>
    <para>If you are using a GT release prior to 4.0.5, we highly recommend <ulink url="/toolkit/downloads/">upgrading your installation</ulink> to the latest version.</para>
<important>The postinstall step of the RLS installation requires that the <computeroutput>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</computeroutput> include <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</computeroutput>.</important>
<para>Use the following command for bash shell:</para>
<screen>
    % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
</screen>
<para>Use the following command for C shell:</para>
<screen>
    % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
</screen>
<para>If you installed GT without setting the <computeroutput>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</computeroutput> you will need to set it and then run the RLS setup script as follows:</para>
<screen>
    % $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-globus-rls-server
