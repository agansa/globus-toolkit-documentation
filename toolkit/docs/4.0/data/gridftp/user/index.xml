  <title>Basic command line</title>
  <para> For those of you who don’t want the details, but just want the “rules of thumb” on how to get started, the following options will 
   normally give acceptable performance.</para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy –vb –tcp-bs 2097152 –p 4 <replaceable>source_url</replaceable> <replaceable>destination_url</replaceable></screen>
  
  <para>The source/destination URLs will normally be one of the following:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><simpara><replaceable>file:///path/to/my/file</replaceable> if you are accessing a file on a filesystem accessible by the host on which you are running your client.</simpara></listitem>
   <listitem><simpara><replaceable>gsiftp://hostname/path/to/remote/file</replaceable> if you are accessing a file from a GridFTP server.</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist></section>
 
 <section id="s-gridftp-user-putting">
  <title>Putting files</title>
  <para>One of the most basic tasks in GridFTP is to "put" files, i.e., move a file from your filesystem to the server. So for example, if you want to move the file <filename>/tmp/foo</filename> from a filesystem 
   accessible to the host on which you are running your client to a file name <filename>/tmp/bar</filename> on a host named <filename>remote.machine.my.edu</filename> running a GridFTP server, you would use 
   this command:</para>
  <screen>globus-url-copy –vb –tcp-bs 2097152 –p 4 file:///tmp/foo gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar</screen>
  
<para><note><simpara>In theory, <filename>remote.machine.my.edu</filename> could 
   be the same host as the one on which you are running your client, but that is normally only done in testing situations. </simpara></note></para>

 <section id="s-gridftp-user-getting"><title>Getting files</title>
  <para>A get, i.e, moving the file from a server to your filesystem would just reverse the source and destination URLs:</para>
  <para><tip><simpara> Remember the <replaceable>file:</replaceable> always refers to your filesystem.</simpara></tip></para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy –vb –tcp-bs 2097152 –p 4 gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar file:///tmp/foo</screen></section>
 
 <section id="s-gridftp-user-thirdpartytransfers"><title>Third party transfers</title>
  
  <para>Finally, if you want to move a file between two GridFTP servers (a third party transfer), both URLs would use <filename>gsiftp:</filename> as the protocol:</para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy –vb –tcp-bs 2097152 –p 4 gsiftp://<replaceable>other.machine.my.edu</replaceable>/tmp/foo gsiftp://<replaceable>remote.machine.my.edu</replaceable>/tmp/bar</screen>
