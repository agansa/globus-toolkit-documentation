<blockquote>
<p>Features new in release Globus Toolkit 4.0 <font color="purple">[need to distinguish
  between features new to this release and those already supported]</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>A new, complete reimplementation of the server.</li>
  <li>First <font color="purple">[what? FTP implementation or GridFTP implementation?]</font> to
    support striping (using multiple hosts to move a single file).</li>
  <li>This new implementation will greatly ease new feature additions and modifications
    of the server (new commands, new data sources such as mass storage devices,
    etc.), maintainability, and resolves a licensing issue that was discovered. </li>
  <li>GSI security: This is PKI based defacto standard security system used in
    Grid applications. Kerberos is also possible, but not supported and can be
    difficult due to divergence in the capabilities of GSI and Kerberos.</li>
  <li>Third-party
      transfers: Very common in Grid applications, this is where a client mediates
      a transfer between two servers (both likely at remote sites) rather than
    between the server and itself (called a client/server transfer).</li>
  <li>Partial
      file access: Regions of a file may be accessed by specifying an offset
    into the file and the length of the block desired.</li>
  <li>Reliability/restart: The
      receiving server periodically (the default is 5 seconds, but this can be
      changed) sends &ldquo;restart markers&rdquo; to
      the client. This marker is a messages specifying what bytes have been successfully
      written to the disk. If the transfer fails, the client may restart the
      transfer, and provide these markers (or an aggregated equivalent marker)
      and the transfer will pick up where it left off. This can include &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in
      the file.</li>
  <li>Large file support: All file sizes, lengths, and offsets are 64
    bits in length, thus allowing support for files up to 8 in length.</li>
  <li> Data
    channel reuse</li>
  <li>Integrated instrumentation</li>
  <li>Logging/audit trail</li>
  <li>Parallel transfers</li>
  <li>TCP Buffer size control</li>
  <li>Server-side computation</li>
  <li>Based on Standards</li>
</ul>
  <p>Other Supported Features
<ul>
  <li>On the client side, we provide a scriptable client side tool called globus-url-copy.
    This tool can take advantage of all the GridFTP protocol features and can
    also do protocol translation between FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and posix file IO
    on the client machine. </li>
  <li>We also provide a set of development libraries
      and APIs for developers wishing to add GridFTP functionality to their application.</li>
  </ul>
