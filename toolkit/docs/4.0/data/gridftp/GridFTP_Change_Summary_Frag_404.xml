<para>No changes have been made for GridFTP since 4.0.2. However, please remember that a protocol change was made in 4.0.1 
    to match a wuftpd extension regarding listings and resolve an issue with a function in the Java Cog Kit. This breaks technical protocol compatibility with 
    RFC959 (FTP), but matches the behavior of 2.4.x servers.  See 
    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=3507">Bug 3507</ulink> for details.</para>
