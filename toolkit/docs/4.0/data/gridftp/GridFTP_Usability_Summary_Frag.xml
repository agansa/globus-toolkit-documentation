<para>The following areas have received substantial effort in order to make using GridFTP easier, 
    more enjoyable, etc:</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara>100% protocol compatability with previous versions.  Any client / server combination since 2.4.0 
			should work (barring a new client trying to invoke new functionality on an old server)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Greatly improved documentation.  It is not complete, and we will continue to develop it, but it is far 
		better than past versions.</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><para>
For GT4.0.0 there is a completely new server implementation, this provides the following benefits:
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara>More stable (one project went from on the order of 1000 failures in a large workflow with the 2.4.3 server to zero failures with the new server)</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>More scalable (we had a single server supporting 1800 clients)</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Easier to extend, modify (The Data Storage Interface (DSI) allows a clean way to access things other than POSIX file systems, such as tape systems, custom storage systems, etc)</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Ability to run threaded (previous versions of the server were not supported running threaded)</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Striping is now available (allows multi-Gigabit speeds)</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Easier server configuration</simpara></listitem>
