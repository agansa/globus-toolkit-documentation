<section id="s-rft-admin-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with RFT. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation.</para>
    <important>
        <simpara> This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
          overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <ulink url="../../admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink>.  
          Read through this guide before continuing!</simpara>

<para>RFT is used to perform third-party transfers across GridFTP servers. It
  uses a database to store its state periodically
  so the transfers can be recovered from any failures. RFT uses
  standard grid security mechanisms for authorization and authentication
  of the users. In order to effectively use RFT you should have
  installed and configured a database with RFT database schemas and have
  the necessary security infrastructure in place to perform a 3rd party
  transfer.</para>

<section id="s-rft-admin-installing"><title>Building and Installing</title>
<para>RFT is built and installed as part
      of a default GT 4.0 installation. For basic installation instructions,
      see the <ulink url="../../admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's
      Guide</ulink>. No extra installation steps
are required for this component.</para>

<section id="s-rft-admin-configuring"><title>Configuring </title>

<section id="s-rft-admin-postgresql"><title>Required configuration: configuring the PostgreSQL
  database</title>
<para>PostgreSQL (version 7.1 or greater) needs to be installed and configured for
  RFT to work. You can either use the packages which came with your operating
system (RPMs, DEBs, ...) or build from source. We used
    PostgreSQL version 7.3.2 for our testing and the following instructions are
  good for the same. </para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>Install PostgreSQL. Instructions on how to install/configure
PostgreSQL can be found <ulink
 url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">here</ulink>.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Configure the postmaster daemon
    so that it accepts TCP connections. This can be done by adding the "-o -i" switch
    to the postmaster script (This is either the init.d script found in /etc/init.d/postgresql or /var/lib/, depending on how you installed PostgreSQL). Follow the instructions <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/postmaster-start.html">here</ulink> to start the postmaster with the -i option.</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para> You will now need to create a PostgreSQL user that will connect to 
    the database. This is usually the account under which the container is 
    running. You can create a PostgreSQL user by running the following command:
    <computeroutput>su postgres; createuser globus</computeroutput>. If you get the following error:
    <computeroutput>
    psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</computeroutput>
this generally  means that either your postmaster is not started with the -i option or you didn't restart the postmaster after the above mentioned step.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para> Now you need to set security on the database you are about to create. You can do it by following the steps below: </para>
	    <para>
   <computeroutput>sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf </computeroutput> and append the following line to the file:
    </para>
    <para>
    <computeroutput>
        host rftDatabase "username" "host-ip" 255.255.255.255 md5
        </computeroutput>
        Note: use crypt instead of md5 if you are using PostgreSQL 7.3 or earlier.
        </para>

    <para><computeroutput> sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart </computeroutput>
    </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>To create the database that is used for RFT run (as user globus):
      <computeroutput>createdb rftDatabase</computeroutput>.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>To populate the RFT database with the appropriate schemas run: <computeroutput>psql -d rftDatabase -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft/rft_schema.sql</computeroutput>. Now that you have created a database to store RFT's state, the following steps configure RFT to find the database:
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Open <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_rft/jndi-config.xml</computeroutput>.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Find the <computeroutput>dbConfiguration</computeroutput> section under the <computeroutput>ReliableFileTransferService &lt;service&gt;</computeroutput> section. </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Change the <computeroutput>connectionString</computeroutput> to point to the machine on which
    you installed PostgreSQL and to the name of the database you used in step 2. 
    If you installed PostgreSQL on the same machine as your Globus install, the
    default should work fine for you.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Change the <computeroutput>userName</computeroutput> to the name of the user who owns/created
    the database and do the same for the password (it also depends on how you configured your database).</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Don't worry about the other parameters in the section. The defaults should
    work fine for now.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Edit the configuration section under <computeroutput>ReliableFileTransferService</computeroutput>. There are two values that can be edited in this section:</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para><computeroutput>backOff</computeroutput>: Time in seconds you want RFT to backoff before a failed transfer is retried by RFT. The default should work fine for now.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><computeroutput>maxActiveAllowed</computeroutput>: This is the number of transfers the container can do at given point. The default should be fine for now.</para></listitem>

<section id="s-rft-admin-deploying"><title>Deploying</title>
<para>RFT is deployed as part of a standard toolkit installation. Please refer to the <ulink url="../../admin/docbook/">System Administrator's Guide</ulink> for details.</para>

<section id="s-rft-admin-deploying-tomcat"><title>Deploying into Tomcat</title>
<para> RFT has been tested to work without any additional setup when deployed into Tomcat. Please follow these <ulink url="../../common/javawscore/admin-index.html#javawscore-admin-tomcat-deploying">basic instructions</ulink> to deploy GT4 services into Tomcat. Note: you need to configure the GT4 install with the needed RFT configuration (like database configuration, etc) before you deploy into Tomcat.</para>

<orderedlist><title>RFT Testing</title>
      <listitem>
      <para>Set <computeroutput> $GLOBUS_LOCATION </computeroutput> to point to your Globus install.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>Start a gridftp server on the machine you are running the
tests on the default port. This can be done by running: </para>
      <screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -p 2811 &amp;</screen>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Start the container with RFT deployed in it.</para></listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>Edit $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft_test/test.properties. Put in appropriate values for properties like authzValue (self or host), HOST (host ip of container), PORT (port on which the container is listening), sourceHost and destinationsHost (hostnames of gridftp servers). The default values will work fine if you are running the tests with a standard stand-alone container started with user credentials (self authorization is done in this case). If the container is started using host credentials, change authzVal to host. If the gridftp servers you are using for your testing are started as user, you need to supply subject names of the users in sourceSubject and destinationSubject for authorization with gridftp servers. If both the source and destination servers are started as one user, you can just fill in the user's subject in the subject field of test.properties. <emphasis>If you are getting Authentication/Authorization Failures because of mismatched subject names then your authzVal and authType (uses transport security by default) need to be changed, depending on how you start the container. If you started the container with the -nosec option then you need to change authType to GSI_MESSAGE, PROTOCOL to http and PORT to 8080. </emphasis> </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>The *.xfr files in  $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft_test/ are the transfer files that will be used in the tests. Again, the default values work fine if you followed the instructions so far.</para>
      </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>Run the following command, which will run all the RFT unit tests:</para>
    <screen>ant -Dtests.jar=$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/globus_wsrf_rft_test.jar -f share/globus_wsrf_rft_test/runtests.xml</screen>
    </listitem>

<section><title>PostgreSQL not configured</title>
  <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> If RFT is not configured properly to talk to a PostgreSQL
  database, you will see this message displayed on the console when you start
the container:</para>
<screen>"Error creating RFT Home: Failed to connect to database ... 
Until this is corrected all RFT request will fail and all GRAM jobs that require staging will fail". </screen>
<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> The usual cause is that Postmaster is not accepting TCP connections, which means that you must restart Postmaster with the -i option (see <xref linkend="s-rft-admin-postgresql"/>).</para>
</section>
  
  <section><title>More verbose error messages</title>
  <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> Make RFT print more verbose error messages</para>
<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Edit $GLOBUS_LOCATION/container-log4j.properties 
and add the following line to it: 
<computeroutput>log4j.category.org.globus.transfer=DEBUG</computeroutput>. For more verbosity add
<computeroutput>log4j.category.org.globus.ftp=DEBUG</computeroutput>, which will print out Gridftp
messages too.
