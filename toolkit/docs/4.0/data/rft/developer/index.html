<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
RFT Service implementation
in 3.9.3 uses
standard SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd
party GridFTP transfers and to delete files using GridFTP. The user
creates a RFT resource by submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files
that need to be transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The
user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user is
creating to a GT4 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and
authenticated. RFT service implementation exposes operations to control
and manage the transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both
RFT factory and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource
the user created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource
property to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for
the changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.<br>

<h2><a name="archdes"></a>Architecture and design overview</h2>
A design doc can be found <a href="../Protocol%20overview.doc">here</a>.<br>
<h2><a name="pubinterfaces"></a>Public interface</h2>
<p>The semantics and syntax of the APIs and WSDL for the component,
along with descriptions of domain-specific structured interface data,
can be found in the <a href="../RFT_Public_Interfaces.html">public
interface guide</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Usage scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scenario 1: You have a large dataset and you want to make sure
all the files are transferred. RFT is used to reliably transfer the
data.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Scenario 2: RFT is also used to perform staging operations in
GRAM and to remove files and directories on a gridftp server.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="features"></a>Feature summary</h2>
<h2><a name="platforms"></a>Tested platforms</h2>
RFT is tested on Linux and is being tested on Windows and Mac OS X. <br>
<br>
<h2><a name="compatibility"></a>Backward compatibility summary</h2>
This version of RFT is not compatible with any previous versions
of&nbsp; RFT released with earlier versions of the toolkit.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="dependencies"></a>Technology dependencies</h2>
RFT depends on WS-Core, WS-Delegation service at compile time and
GridFTP servers at runtime.<br>
<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
Database configuration is most complicated and important part of RFT
setup. You can find more instrcutions on troubleshooting it <a
