<para>Other than bug fixes, no changes have been made to WS GRAM since 4.0.5.</para>
<para>However, WS GRAM users could benefit from the RFT connection caching improvement in this release.  
    For example, a Condor-G user submitting 1000 jobs that do file staging (no matter the file size) to the same WS GRAM service 
    would benefit from the RFT enhancement.  When submitting jobs with file staging or file cleanup directives, WS GRAM will use 
    RFT to get that work done.  If there are jobs for the same user that use the same two GridFTP servers, then RFT will cache that 
    connection and reuse it for multiple jobs.  This saves the effort of connecting, authenticating, authorizing for each file transfer.  
    Performance tests showed improvements of around 30% and improved reliability.  For this reason, 4.0.6 is highly recommended 
    for WS GRAM users that make use of file staging and cleanup directives.
