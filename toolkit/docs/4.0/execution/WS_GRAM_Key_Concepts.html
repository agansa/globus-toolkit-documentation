WS_GRAM provides a set of web services to submit, monitor, and cancel
jobs on Grid computing resources.  Jobs are computational tasks that
may perform input/output operations while running which affect the
state of the computational resource and its associated filesystems.
In practice, such jobs may require coordinated staging of data into
the resource prior to job execution and out of the resource following
execution.  Monitoring consists of querying and subscribing for status
information such as job state changes.

Grid computing resources are typically operated under the control of a
scheduler which implements allocation and prioritization policies
while optimizing the execution of all submitted jobs for efficiency
and performance.  WS_GRAM is not a resource scheduler, but rather a
protocol engine for communicating with a range of different local
resource schedulers using a standard message format.

To provide reliable and secure access to a range of schedulers in a
Grid setting, WS_GRAM integrates a range of concepts for secure web
messaging, data transfer, and local computer security management:

<ul>

<li>Secure job submission. Subject to appropriate authorization, and
insulated from malicous interference, a client is able to enter a new
job into the local scheduler via WS_GRAM.</li>

<li>Reliable job submission. WS_GRAM provides an "at most once" job
submission semantics, meaning that a client is able to check for and
resubmit jobs to account for transient communication errors without
risk of accidentally running more than one copy of the job.</li>

<li>Job cancellation. While many jobs are allowed to run to their
natural completion, WS_GRAM provides a mechanism for clients to cancel
(abort) their jobs at any point in the job lifecycle.</li>

<li>Reliable data staging. WS_GRAM provides for reliable,
high-performance transfers of files between the compute resource and
external (gridftp) data storage elements before and after the job
execution.</li>

<li>Output monitoring. WS_GRAM provides a mechanism for incrementally
transferring output file contents from the computation resource while
the job is running.</li>

<li>Credential delegation and management. A client may delegate some
of its rights to WS_GRAM services in order to facilitate the above
functions, e.g. rights for WS_GRAM to access data on a remote storage
element as part of the job execution. Additionally, the client may
delegate rights for use by the job process itself.</li>

<li>Local system protection domains. To protect users from each other,
jobs are executed in appropriate local security contexts, e.g. under
specific Unix user IDs based on details of the job request and
authorization policies.  Additionally, WS_GRAM mechanisms used to
interact with the local resource are design to minimize the priveleges
required and to minimize the risks of service malfunction or
compromise.</li>

<li>Audit. To assist with normal accounting functions as well as to
further mitigate risks from abuse or malfunction, WS_GRAM uses a range
of audit and logging techniques to record a history of job submissions
and critical system operations.</li>

</ul>
