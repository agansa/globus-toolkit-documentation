<para>The aggregator framework does not have its own service side configuration, although services which are based on the framework
  have their own service side configuration options (such as <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/index/">MDS Index</ulink> and 
  <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/trigger/">MDS Trigger</ulink>) which are documented in the per-service documentation.</para>
  
  <para>Registrations to a working aggregator framework are configured
    for the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/aggregator/re01.html">mds-servicegroup-add</ulink> tool. This tool takes an XML configuration file listing
    registrations, and causes those registrations to be made.</para>
    
<para> In general, configuration in WS MDS involves configuring the index service to [concise description] and configuring the trigger service to [concise description].
  The mechanism for doing both of these is defined by (inherited from) the aggregator framework and described in this section. </para>

<para>Configuring an Aggregating Service Group to perform a data
aggregation is performed by specifying an AggregatorContent object
as the content parameter of a ServiceGroup <emphasis><emphasis>add</emphasis></emphasis> method
invocation. An AggregatorContent object is composed of two
xsd:any arrays: AggregatorConfig and AggregatorData:</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><simpara>The AggregatorConfig xsd:any array is used to specify parameters that are to be
passed to the underlying AggregatorSource when the ServiceGroup
<emphasis>add</emphasis> method is invoked. These parameters are
generally type-specific to the implementation of the
AggregatorSource and/or AggregatorSink being used.</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>The AggregatorData xsd:any array is used as the storage
location for aggregated data that is the result of message
deliveries to the AggregatorSink. Generally, the
AggregatorData parameter of the AggregatorContent is not populated
when the ServiceGroup <emphasis><emphasis>add</emphasis></emphasis> method is invoked, but
rather is populated by message delivery from the
AggregatorSource.</simpara></listitem>
