<title> GT 4.0 WS MDS Aggregator Framework: Developer's Guide</title>
<titleabbrev>Developer's Guide</titleabbrev>

<section id="s-aggregator-developer-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
    <para>The aggregator framework allows pluggable data sources and sinks
    to be written and connected together. Generally a source collects
    data from or about a particular grid resource, and passes it to a
        sink which does something interesting with it.</para>
    
    <para>The aggregator sinks supplied with the toolkit implement the
    <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/index">WS MDS Index Service</ulink> and <ulink url=
        "http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/trigger">WS MDS Trigger Service</ulink>. The <glossterm linkend="aggregator-source">aggregator sources</glossterm>
    supplied with the toolkit collect information using resource
    property queries, subscription/notification, and execution of
        external programs.</para>
    
    <para>This document describes the programmatic interfaces to the
        aggregator framework. See also general Globus Toolkit <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/coding_guidelines.html">coding guidelines</ulink> and

<section><title>Creating WS MDS services</title>
<para>The aggregator framework is used to create MDS services by
linking an <emphasis>aggregator source</emphasis> (a java class that implements
the AggregatorSource interface to collect data) to an <emphasis>aggregator
sink</emphasis> (a java class that implements the AggregatorSink interface
to process data, e.g., by providing a service interface for it).
The AggregatorSource and AggregatorSink interfaces are documented
in the aggregator <ulink url=
"WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html">Public Interface
Guide</ulink>.</para>
