    and test a service (such as the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/index/">Index

Troubleshooting</title>
<para><emphasis>Problem: I was able to successfully register an aggregator
entry with <command>mds-servicegroup-add</command>, but the aggregator
    isn't collecting data for the registration.</emphasis></para> 
    
    <para>Solution: The fact that the registration was successful does not mean that there are
no errors in the registration parameters. Verify that details such
as resource EPRs, resource property names, and queries are
    accurate, and check the container logs for the <glossterm linkend="aggregator-services">aggregator service</glossterm>
        and (if applicable) the remote service for more information.</para>
    
<para><emphasis>Problem: I was able to successfully register an aggregator
entry with <command>mds-servicegroup-add</command>, and the aggregator
collected information for this entry for a while, but then the
    entry disappeared.</emphasis></para> 
    
    <para>Solution: make sure that
<command>mds-servicegroup-add</command> is still running. Registrations
time out; <command>mds-servicegroup-add</command> refreshes them
periodically.</para>
