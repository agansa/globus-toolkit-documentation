<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with WS MDS Aggregator. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation.</p>

<P> [put following paragraph in &lt;important&gt; element] <br>
This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the &lt;ulink
url=&quot;../../admin/docbook/&quot;&gt;GT 4.0 System Administrator's Guide&lt;/ulink&gt;. <br>
Read through this guide before continuing!</P>
<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>

<p>The aggregator  framework is built and installed as part of the standard
  <a href="../../../admin/docbook/">Globus Toolkit installation procedure</a>.


<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring</h2>
<?php
include_once( "./../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Interface_Config_Frag.html" );
?>
<p>The aggregator  framework does not have its own service side configuration,
  although services which are based on the framework have their own service side
configuration options, documented in the per-service documentation.</p>
<p>Registrations to a working aggregator framework are configured for the <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> tool,
  which is documented in the <a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#cmd">public
  interface guide</a>. This tool takes an XML configuration file listing registrations,
  and causes thoses registrations to be made.</p>
<p>The tool can be deployed at the aggregating service, at resource services,
  or at any other location. This allows registrations to be configured by the
  administrator of the aggregating service, or by the administrator of resources,
  by a third party, or by some combination of those.</p>
Three Aggregator Sources are included in the Globus Toolkit distribution:
<ul>
  <li> The <code>QueryAggregatorSource</code> gathers resource property values
    from the registered resource using one of the three WS-Resource Properties
    poll operations. .</li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>GetResourcePropertyPollType</code>; requests a single Resource
      Property from the remote resource. </li>
    <li><code>GetMultipleResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests multiple
      Resource Properties from the remote resource. </li>
    <li><code>QueryResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests a query be executed
      against the Resource Property Set of the remote resource. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <code>SubscriptionAggregatorSource</code> gathers resource property
    values from the registered resource using WS-Notification subscriptions. </li>
  <li>The <code>ExecutionAggregatorSource</code> gathers arbitrary XML information
    about a registered resource by executing an external script and passing registration
    as parameters. See the <a href="../developer/">developers guide</a> for details
    of this API. 
</ul>
<h2><a name="deploying"></a>Deploying</h2>
<p>This component is deployed as part of the standard toolkit installation.</p>
<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>
<p>The aggregator framework is a software framework used to create services.
To test that the aggregator framwork is working, deploy and test a service
(such as the <a href="../../index/">Index Service</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="security_considerations"></a>Security Considerations </h2>
<?php

<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><i>Problem: I was able to successfully register an aggregator entry
with <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code>, but the aggregator isn't
collecting data for the registration.</i> Solution: the fact that the
registration was successful does not mean that there are no errors in
the registration parameters.  Verify that details such as resource
EPRs, resource property names, and queries are accurate, and check the
container logs for the aggregator service and (if applicable) the
remote service for more information.</p>
<p><i>Problem: I was able to successfully register an aggregator entry
with <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code>, and the aggregator collected
information for this entry for a while, but then the entry
disappeared.</i> Solution: make sure that
<code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> is still running.  Registrations
time out; <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> refreshes them
periodically.</p>
