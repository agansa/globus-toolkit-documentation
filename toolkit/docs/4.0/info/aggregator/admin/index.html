<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The aggregator is a framework for services which collect information
from or about services or resources in a virtual organisation.</p>

<p>Two such services in the GT4 release are the 
<a href="../../index/">Index Service</a> and the 
<a href="../../trigger/">Trigger Service</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>

<p>The aggregator framework is built and installed as part of the standard
  <a href="../../../admin/index.html">Globus Toolkit installation procedure</a>.


<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring</h2>
<p>Information on configuration settings and environment variables can be found
  in the <a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
  guide</a>.</p>

<p>The aggregator framework does not have its own service side 
configuration, although services which are based on the framework 
have their own service side configuration options, documented in the
per-service documentation.</p>

<p>Registrations to a working aggregator are configured for the
<code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> tool, which is documented in the
<a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#cmd">public interface guide</a>. This tool takes an 
XML configuration file listing registrations, and causes thoses
registrations to be made.</p>

<p>The tool can be deployed at the aggregating service, at resource
services, or at any other location. This allows registrations to be
configured by the administrator of the aggregating service, or by
the administrator of resources, by a third party, or by some combination
of those.</p>

Three Aggregator Sources are included in the Globus Toolkit distribution:
<ul>
<li>
The <code>QueryAggregatorSource</code> gathers resource property values from 
the registered resource using one of the three WS-Resource Properties
poll operations.
.</li>
<ul>
<li><code>GetResourcePropertyPollType</code>; requests a single 
Resource Property from the remote resource.
</li>

<li><code>GetMultipleResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests multiple
Resource Properties from the remote resource.
</li>

<li><code>QueryResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests a query be
executed against the Resource Property Set of the remote resource.
</li>
</ul>
<li>The <code>SubscriptionAggregatorSource</code> gathers 
resource property values from
the registered resource using WS-Notification subscriptions.
</li>
<li>The <code>ExecutionAggregatorSource</code> gathers arbitrary
XML information about a registered resource by executing an
external script and passing registration as parameters. See the 
developers guide for details of this API. (TODO crosslink)
</ul>
Detailed information on how to configure aggregator services to use
each of these sources is available in the <a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#config">public interface guide</a>.
