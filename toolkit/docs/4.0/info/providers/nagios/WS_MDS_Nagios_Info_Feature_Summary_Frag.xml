      The Nagios MDS4 Information Provider gets its information
      directly from the Nagios v. 2.x status.dat file. (Support
      remains for the v 1.3 status.log file in the form of the
      alternate script globus-mds-cluster-nagios1.3) It includes
      some custom plugins that return the data in a format that the
      information provider can use.
