<para>

    Starting with version 4.0.5, this information provider is included in the GT4 toolkit and is used to gather data 
    from a Nagios system and publish it into the MDS4 in the standard GLUE schema.</para>

<para>The Nagios MDS4 Information Provider gets its information directly
from the Nagios v. 2.x status.dat file. (Support remains for the v 1.3
status.log file in the form of the alternate script
globus-mds-cluster-nagios1.3) It includes some custom plugins that
return the data in a format that the information provider can
use.</para>

<para>The official Nagios site states the following: &quot;Nagios is a host and
service monitor designed to inform you of network problems before your
clients, end-users or managers do. It has been designed to run under
the Linux operating system, but works fine under most *NIX variants as
well. The monitoring daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and
services you specify using external plugins which return status
information to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can
send notifications out to administrative contacts in a variety of
different ways (email, instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status
information, historical logs, and reports can all be accessed via a
    web browser.&quot;
