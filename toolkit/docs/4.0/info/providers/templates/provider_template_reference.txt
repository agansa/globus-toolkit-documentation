Security Considerations:
    
    <!-- DO NOT EDIT the following 2 paragraphs. This is the security consideration information that will be used for all info providers. -->
    
By default, the aggregator sources do not use authentication credentials -- they retrieve information using anonymous SSL authentication or no authentication at all, and thus retrieve only publicly-available information. If a user or administrator changes that configuration so that a service's aggregator source uses credentials to acquire non-privileged data, then that user or administrator must configure the service's aggregator sink to limit access to authorized users.

Additionally the user should consider that publishing system-specific
information as is the intention of this provider can have security 
ramifications.

    <!-- Add any other security considerations for your provider below. -->
