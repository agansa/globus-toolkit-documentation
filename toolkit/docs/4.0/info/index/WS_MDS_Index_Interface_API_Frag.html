<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>Index service queries are performed using resource property requests; consult
the <a href="../../common/javawscore">WS-Core documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>The contents of an index are maintained using the 
aggregator programming model, and
can receive data from any aggregator source.
Information about how to configure existing aggregator sources (such as the
aggregator sources distributed with the Globus Toolkit, which include one
that polls for resource property information, one that collects resource
property information through subscription/notification, and one that collects
information by executing an executable program) is found in the
<a href="../index/WS_MDS_Index_Public_Interfaces.html#config">MDS Index Public
Interface Guide</a>; information about how to create new aggregator
sources can be found in the
<a href="../aggregator/index.html">aggregator documentation</a>.
