aggregator sources (such as the aggregator sources distributed with
the Globus Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource
property information, one that collects resource property
information through subscription/notification, and one that
collects information by executing an executable program) is found
in the <ulink url=

create new aggregator sources can be found in the <ulink url=
