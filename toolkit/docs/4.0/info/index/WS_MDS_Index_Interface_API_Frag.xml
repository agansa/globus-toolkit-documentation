<para>The contents of an index are maintained using the aggregator
framework programming model, and can receive data from any
aggregator source. Information about how to configure existing
aggregator sources (such as the aggregator sources distributed with
the Globus Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource
property information, one that collects resource property
information through subscription/notification, and one that
collects information by executing an executable program) is found

create new aggregator sources can be found in the <ulink url=
