<p>[summary of major changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>changed 'aggregation services' back to 'aggregator services' </li>
  <li>changed 'monitored entity' to 'Grid resource' </li>
  <li>took out definition of &quot;information&quot;</li>
  <li>introducing term &quot;information flow&quot; to describe the path of info from grid
    resources to aggregator service (which corresponds with ben's deployment
    overview graphic] </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>aggregator service</h2>
<p>A service that collects information using the WS-MDS aggregator framework,
  and then does something with it.  WS-MDS includes two aggregator services:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>MDS-Index, which publishes information as service groups</li>
  <li>MDS-Trigger,
          which runs an arbitrary executable program, passing the information
    as input to that program</li>
</ul>
<p>A third aggregator service is planned: an MDS-Archive,
          which will maintain an archive of historical information. </p>
<h2>[information sources]</h2>
<p>Sources of information about a Grid resource you want to monitor. <em>Grid
    resources</em>  are essentially any entity in a virtual organization (VO)
    from which a user wants to obtain information: for
    example, a file, a program, a Web service, or another network-enabled service.
    Something can be both a Grid resource *and* an information source if it collects
    information about itself. The most common example in WS MDS is a WSRF service,
    which provides information about its own resource properties (WS-Resources.)
    Otherwise, an information source collects the information from the Grid resource
    and formats it so that it is compatible with WS MDS (for example, GridFTP
    servers do not routinely supply XML-formatted monitoring information, so
    an external information source is required to collect and format that information.)</p>
<p>[i'd still like examples of 'external information source' - wrapper program??] </p>
<h2>aggregator source</h2>
<p>An aggregator source collects  information from an information source and
  passes it to an aggregator service (usually an MDS-Index service). More specifically,
  an aggregator source is a java class that implements the AggregatorSource interface
  (in the Aggregator framework) to take information from
  an information source and pass it to an aggregator service in XML. The MDS-Index
  service calls the aggregator source to collect information. There are several
  kinds of aggregator sources. </p>
<p>
Several aggregator sources are included as part of the GT distribution, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;poll-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which polls WSRF services
    for resource properties</li>
  <li>&lt;subscribe-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which receives
    resource properties from WSRF services through subscription/notification</li>
  <li>&lt;executable-source-name&gt;, a non-WSRF aggregator source which runs
    an executable to acquire (or generate) information in some XML form.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information flow between Grid resources and aggregator services </h2>
<p>In theory, an aggregator source could simply generate information on its own;
  in practice, however, aggregator sources generally communicate with information
  sources. In turn, information sources can publish information about themselves
  (which also makes it a monitoring entity) but many times publishes information
  about a separate Grid resource. </p>
<p>To put it all together, the <em>information flow</em> describes how information
  sources and aggregator sources carry information from a Grid resource to an
  aggregator service. First we'll describe the relationship between these entities
  and then show a diagram of the flow. </p>
<p>The following table uses three different examples to describe the relationships:</p>

  represent examples. -- Cris] </p>
