    <para>The WS MDS Trigger Service collects information about Grid resources
and can be configured to execute a program if the collected data meets
        certain conditions.</para>
    
    <para>End-users will typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
        specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
        program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
        will later be read by some other program).</para>
