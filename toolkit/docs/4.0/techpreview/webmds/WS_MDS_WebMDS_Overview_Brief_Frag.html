WebMDS allows monitoring information to be presented to end users
through a standard web browser interface. This means that end users
do not need to install any software on their PC.  The WebMDS servlet
uses a plugin to gather monitoring information in XML form (such as
resource properties) and XSLT transformations to present the data
in a readable form.  Administrators can add additional plugins and transforms
and configure which ones are used.
