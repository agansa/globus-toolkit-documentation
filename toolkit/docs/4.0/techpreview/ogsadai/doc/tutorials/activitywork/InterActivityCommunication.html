<h1>How Activities Inter-communicate</h1>
<p>
Communication between activities within a request is done via pipes
(created by the engine) that link activities together. Blocks of data
are passed through these pipes from producer to consumer. These pipes
are made available to an activity via the context and are
retrieved when the activity is initialised. A pipe implements the
<span class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.BlockReader</span> and
<span class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.BlockWriter</span>
interfaces, used by the consumer and producer respectively. Any given
activity must use a pipe as either as a <span
class="java">BlockReader</span> or a <span 
class="java">BlockWriter</span>. 
</p>

<h2 id="Blocks">Blocks</h2>
<p>
The blocks of data that activities pass between them are represented
by Java objects. In consequence, any object in Java can be put into 
a <span class="java">BlockWriter</span> for consumption by another 
activity. Currently there is no type checking done between
activities. This means that it is possible to link two activities
together that do not have a common data type that they understand,
e.g. activity A provides <span class="java">org.w3c.dom.Element</span> 
objects to activity B and B expects to be reading in 
<span class="java">ByteArray</span> objects. This will result in a  
<span class="java">ClassCastException</span> being thrown by the
activity receiving the unknown type (activity B in this example). Each 
activity may do type checking, but this is not required. If a 
<span class="java">ClassCastException</span> is generated the 
engine will catch it and allow the request to fail gracefully,
returning a Response document containing the exception noted against
the activity it occurred in.  
</p>
<p>
There is currently no notion of block size beyond that which an
activity imposes itself. To elaborate, if a query activity defines a
block to be one row of output from some result set obtained from a
relational database then a block is one row. If that activity has a
configuration option to set the block size to ten rows then a block is
ten rows. However, both the single row and the ten rows block sizes
will be handled in exactly the same way by the 
engine. They are both passed between activities as a single Java
object by the engine. There is no mechanism provided for the consumer
to find out the block size that the producer was using. 
</p>

<h2 id="BlockWriter"><span class="java">BlockWriter</span></h2>  
<p>
<span class="java">BlockWriter</span>s are used by activities to write
blocks (<span class="java">Objects</span>) to an output. A <span
class="java">BlockWriter</span> normally is one side of a pipe; the
other side of which is a <span class="java">BlockReader</span>. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="java">BlockWriter</span> exposes the two methods:
</p>
<pre class="java">
public void put(Object)
public void close()
</pre>
<p>
To write an object to an output, simply pass it to the <span
class="java">put(Object)</span> method. Once there is nothing more to
write the pipe should be closed using the <span
class="java">close()</span> method, thereby notifying any consumers of 
the output that there are no more blocks.
</p>
 
<h2 id="BlockReader"><span class="java">BlockReader</span></h2>
<p>
<span class="java">BlockReader</span>s are used by activities to read
blocks from an input. The status of this class (either open for
reading or closed for reading) will track the status of the <span
class="java">BlockWriter</span> with which it is paired, if any. The
class exposes only one method: 
</p>
<pre class="java">
public Object next() throws NoSuchElementException
</pre>
<p>
The <span class="java">next()</span> method returns the next block
from its input. What constitutes a block is arbitrary and is
determined by whatever produced the <span class="java">Object</span> 
that has been published via the <span
class="java">BlockReader</span>. If the end of the input is reached
and there are no more blocks to consume then a <span
class="java">NoSuchElementException </span> is thrown.
</p>
<p>
A call to <span class="java">next()</span> may block the calling
thread until the source has produced a block to be consumed. Blocking
is the norm rather than the exception because the logic governing the
extent of internal caching is not yet implemented.
