<p> OGSA-DAI provides a pure Java data service framework for accessing and integrating
  data resources - such as files, relational and XML databases - on to grids.
  It is motivated by the need to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Expose intrinsic data resource capabilities - such as the ability to perform
    SQL queries on relational resources or evaluate XPath statements on XML collections
    - through web service based interfaces, thus allowing data resources to be
    easily incorporated as first class citizens in grids. </li>
  <li> Allows additional functionality to be implemented at the service - such
    as transformation of data coming out of a data resource - so as to avoid
    unnecessary data movement. </li>
  <li> Provides a compact way of handling multiple potential interactions with
    a service within a single request via an XML document, called a perform document,
    where data is pipelined between different set of activities that operate
    on a data stream coming out of, or going into, a data resource. </li>
  <li> The perform document, and underlying framework, are extensible allowing
    additional functionality to be added, or existing functionality to be customised,
    and still operate within the same framework. This allows developers to easily
    add or extend functionality within OGSA-DAI. </li>
  <li> Allows metadata about data and the data resources in which it is found
    to be queried via a service interface. </li>
  <li> Facilitates the provision of data integration capabilities from various
    sources to obtain the required information. </li>
</ul>
<p> This WS-RF distribution of OGSA-DAI has been designed to work with the Globus
  Toolkit 4 implementation of WS-RF; a WS-I distribution is also available from
  the OGSA-DAI web site, which is designed to work with the UK <a href="http://www.omii.ac.uk">OMII</a> web
  services infrastructure releases. Finally, an OGSI-based distribution of OGSA-DAI,
  designed to work with the GT3.2 releases, is also available from the project
  web site. Note: these releases are not designed to inter-operate. More information
  about these and OGSA-DAI in general is available from the project website at <a href="http://www.ogsadai.org.uk/">http://www.ogsadai.org.uk</a>. </p>
