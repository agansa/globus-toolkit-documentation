<para>As indicated in the release notes for the 4.0.1 release of the DRS, we have stabilized the interfaces to the service. The WSDL remains unchanged from the 4.0.1 release. The bug fixes for this release significantly improve the scalability of the service. We have tested concurrent operations and scalability and resolved problems in the DRS code as well as in its dependent components (Java WS Core and RFT) which affected DRS performance.</para>
