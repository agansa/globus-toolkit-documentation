      Normally in stream mode the destination is the pasv side for a third party
      transfer, and the server is the pasv side for two party (client->server)
      transfers. Two party transfers also had a failover mode where if the PASV
      command failed, it would automatically switch to PASV on the client end.
      This allows a server that knows it must connect out to disable the PASV
      command and all clients will work the way it wants. However, this
      auto-failover feature was not implemented for third party transfers. The
      auto-failover for third party transfers is available in this release.
