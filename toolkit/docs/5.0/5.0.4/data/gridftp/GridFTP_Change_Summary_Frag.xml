  <title>Summary of Changes in GridFTP</title>

      <simpara>
      Added globus-gridftp-server options -dc-default and -fs-default to make configurable the default xio driver stack for the network and filesystem.  Previously, only the client was able to set this in a session.  This makes it possible to always use drivers such as the rate limiting driver or the netlogger driver.
