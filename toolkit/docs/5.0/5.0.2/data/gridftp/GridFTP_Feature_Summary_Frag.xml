  <title>Feature Summary</title>
  <para>Features new in GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>:
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Improved failure restart capability in globus-url-copy:</simpara>
        <simpara>A new option to store untransferred urls for later restarting is available. In case of any failures, 
          this option allows users to restart transfers from a checkpoint rather than restarting from scratch.
          This option can be used for directory transfers, single file transfer or a list of files transfer.
          See <olink targetdoc="gridftpUser" targetptr="gridftp-user-advanced-failures"/> for more details.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Stall detection:</simpara>
        <simpara>It is possible that the transfer hangs due to filesystem errors, network errors or GridFTP server errors. 
          A new option is available in globus-url-copy to specify how long before canceling/restarting a transfer with 
          no data movement.
          See <olink targetdoc="gridftpUser" targetptr="globus-url-copy-reliability"/> for more details.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Client-side host aliasing:</simpara>
        <simpara>This allows <olink targetdoc="gridftpUser" targetptr="concurrent">concurrent transfers</olink> to be extended 
          to multiple different hosts rather than multiple connections to the same host, without relying on DNS.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>New options for the command line tool globus-url-sync:</simpara>
		<simpara>The "-g", or "-globus-endpoints", option is used to specify that output be formatted with endpoints, in place of the host portion of source and destination URLs.
	  </simpara>
	  <simpara>The "-n", or "newer" option is used to specify that files are to be transferred, if the source timestamp is newer than the destination timestamp.
	  </simpara>
	  <simpara>The "-o", or "older" option is used to specify that files are to be transferred, if the source timestamp is older than the destination timestamp.
	  </simpara>

        bottleneck detection for GridFTP transfers</simpara>
    </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>GSI security: This is the PKI based, de facto standard security system used in Grid
          applications. Kerberos is also possible but is not supported and can be difficult to use
          due to divergence in the capabilities of GSI and Kerberos.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Third-party transfers: Very common in Grid applications, this is where a
            <glossterm>client</glossterm> mediates a transfer between two servers (both likely at
          remote sites) rather than between the server and itself (called a <glossterm>client/server
            transfer</glossterm>).</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Cluster-to-cluster data movement or Striping: GridFTP can do coordinated data
          transfer by using multiple computer nodes at the source and destination. </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Partial file access: Regions of a file may be accessed by specifying an offset into
          the file and the length of the block desired.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Reliability/restart: The receiving server periodically (the default is 5 seconds,
          but this can be changed) sends &ldquo;restart markers&rdquo; to the client. This marker is
          a messages specifying what bytes have been successfully written to the disk. If the
          transfer fails, the client may restart the transfer and provide these markers (or an
          aggregated equivalent marker), and the transfer will pick up where it left off. This can
          include &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the file.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Large file support: All file sizes, lengths, and offsets are 64 bits in
        length.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Data channel reuse: Data channel can be held open and reused if the next transfer
          has the same source, destination, and credentials. This saves the time of connection
          establishment, authentication, and delegation. This can be a huge performance difference
          when moving lots of small files.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

        <simpara>Parallel transfers (Multiple TCP streams between a pair of hosts).</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>TCP Buffer size control (Protocol supports Manual and Automatic; Only Manual
          Implemented).</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Server-side computation (Extended Retrieve (ERET) / Extended Store (ESTO)
          commands).</simpara>

        <simpara>Based on Standards: RFC 959, RFC 2228, RFC 2389, IETF Draft MLST-16 , GGF
        GFD.020.</simpara>

  <para>Other Supported Features <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>On the client side we provide a scriptable tool called globus-url-copy. This tool
          can take advantage of all the GridFTP protocol features and can also do protocol
          translation between FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and POSIX file IO on the client machine. </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>We also provide a set of development libraries and APIs for developers wishing to
          add GridFTP functionality to their application.</simpara>
