        <simpara>A new tool <command>globus-gram-streamer</command> implements
        stdio streaming similar to gram2, for use with the grid-monitor.sh
        script from Condor. As a result, a Condor-G client which does not know
        about GRAM5 features will be able to submit many jobs to a GRAM5
        server.
