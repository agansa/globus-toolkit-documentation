  <title>Summary of Changes in GRAM5</title>
<indexterm type="gram5"><primary>change summary</primary></indexterm>
<itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
       <simpara>New RSL attribute <literal>save_job_description</literal>. If
       set to <literal>yes</literal>, the job manager will write a file in the
       HOME directory of the user containing the perl representation of the
       job. This can be used to debug LRM interface problems.</simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <simpara>Added command-line help for the
        <command>globus-job-manager-script.pl</command> command. To simplify
        debugging LRM interface problems.
        </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <simpara>A new tool <command>globus-gram-streamer</command> implements
        stdio streaming similar to gram2, for use with the grid-monitor.sh
        script from Condor. As a result, a Condor-G client which does not know
        about GRAM5 features will be able to submit many jobs to a GRAM5
        server.
        </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <simpara>Eliminated the need for a global Condor log file and SEG
        module to parse it. In this version, the Condor logs are per-job and
        removed automatically by the job manager when the job is cleaned up.
