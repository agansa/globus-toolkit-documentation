  <title>Summary of Changes in GRAM5</title>
<indexterm type="gram5"><primary>change summary</primary></indexterm>

   <para>GRAM5 represents a significant improvement from GRAM2 and GRAM4 service implementations.  GRAM2's limitation is scalability.  GRAM4's is reliability.  GRAM5 is both reliable AND scalable.  It is important to note that GRAM5 is GRAM2 compatible.  There are other improvements as well, like completely rewritten service logging based on the <ulink url="http://www.cedps.net/index.php/LoggingBestPractices">CEDPS logging best practices</ulink>, Teragrid Gateway Identity support for job auditing, support for job exit codes, and <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/5.0/5.0.0/execution/gram5/user/#gram5-usage-stats">usage stat support</ulink>.

   <para>
We have been very encouraged by our <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/5.0/5.0.0/execution/gram5/qp/#gram5-reports-throughput">performance results</ulink>, which shows greater than 10x scalability than GRAM2 and roughly 10x reduction in resource consumption on the service host.

We welcome your feedback as you integrate GRAM5 into your production grids.
