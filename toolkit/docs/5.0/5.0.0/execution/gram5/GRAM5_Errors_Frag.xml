  </entry>
  <entry>
Periodically, globusrun-ws will query the GRAM service to check on the job state.  The "End of file" indicates that the GRAM server dropped a connection when globusrun-ws tried to read a response.
This could be caused by temporary network issues between the client and service, or possibly caused by an overloaded service host.
