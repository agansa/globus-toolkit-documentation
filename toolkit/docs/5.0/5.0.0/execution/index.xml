      <para>Execution management tools are concerned with the initiation, monitoring, management,
            scheduling, and/or coordination of remote computations (or jobs). GT5 supports the Grid
            Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM) interface as a basic mechanism for these
            purposes. Other tools are available as described in the table below.</para>
      
      <para>GT5 includes two different GRAM implementations: <itemizedlist>
