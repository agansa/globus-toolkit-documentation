        <title>Ways to configure your server</title>
        <para>As discussed in <olink targetdoc="gridftpAdmin"
	targetptr="gridftp-config-types"/>, there are three ways to configure your GridFTP server: the default configuration (like any normal FTP server), 
        separate (split) process configuration and striped configuration. The latter two provide greater levels of security as described <olink targetdoc="gridftpAdmin" targetptr="gridftp-config-types">here</olink>.</para>

                <simpara><emphasis role="strong">The classic installation.</emphasis> This is the default and is 
                    equivalent to any FTP server you would normally install. It is run as a root
                    setuid process. Once the user is authenticated, the process does a setuid to the
                    appropriate non-privileged user account.</simpara>

                                external user connects to) runs as a non-privileged user (typically
                                the <computeroutput>globus</computeroutput> user). </simpara>

                                access the file system and moves the data) runs as a root setuid
                                program as before but is only contacted by the control channel
                                process from a local machine. This means an external user is never
                                connected to a root running process and thus minimizes the impact of
                                an exploit. This does, however, require that a copy of the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" targetptr="gtadmin-basic-host">host cert and host key</olink> be owned by the non-privileged user. If
                                you use this configuration, the non-privileged user should not have
                                write permission to executables, configuration files, etc.</simpara>
