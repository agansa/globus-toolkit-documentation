        <title>If you are building from the source installer</title>
        <para>If you are building from a source installer, both threaded and non-threaded flavors of
          server and client will be built by default. By default, the server executable in <filename
            >$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin</filename> and the client executable in <filename
            >$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</filename> are non-threaded.</para>

          server and client binaries in <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/[flavor]/shared</filename>
          and <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/[flavor]/shared</filename>. To use those flavors by
          default, simply copy those binaries to <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin or
            $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</filename>.</para>

        <para>If you are using a binary installer, it will only have
	non-threaded GridFTP server and

          installer.</para>
