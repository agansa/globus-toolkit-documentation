          <para>Streamlined startup for RLS.</para>
		  <para>When the RLS server was started, initialization previously took anywhere from several seconds to minutes, depending on the number of entries in the RLS database. During this time, users could not issue queries to the RLS database.</para>
		  <para>The streamlined startup feature allows users to issue read-only queries to the RLS, during initialization. This is achieved by creating Bloom filters during the initialization, in a seperate thread, and disallowing queries that update the database, so as not to interfere with the Bloom filter creation.</para>
