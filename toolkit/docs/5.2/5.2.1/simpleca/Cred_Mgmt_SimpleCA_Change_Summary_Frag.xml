  <title>Summary of Changes in SimpleCA</title>

  <para>The Globus Toolkit <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>
  version of SimpleCA significantly changes the procedure for creating
  and distributing CA packages. In particular, the GPT setup package method
  of creating a package is removed. In its place are the 
  <olink targetdoc="simplecaAdmin" targetptr="grid-ca-create"/> and
  <olink targetdoc="simplecaAdmin" targetptr="grid-ca-package"/> tools.
  </para>

  <para>
  This version also provides native RPM and Debian packages for a range
  of Linux systems, as well as support for creating native packages from
  CA configuration files to make it easier to manage a distribution of
  CAs.
