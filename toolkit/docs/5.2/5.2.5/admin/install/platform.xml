            <para>The libtool library is no longer distributed with
                  MacOS in Mountain Lion. Install the latest libtool from
                  the 
                  <ulink
                  url="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libtool/">GNU libtool source mirror</ulink>
                  prior to building Globus from the
                  source installer. To do so in a way that will work, you'll
                  need to configure libtool with 
                  <command>--program-prefix=g</command> to cause the libtool
                  script to be named <command>glibtool</command> to avoid
                  conflicts with the OS X libtool program which provides
                  different functionality than GNU libtool.

                  If you install libtool in a directory other than your Globus
                  installation directory, you'll need to add it to your
                  build environment, by adding
                  <literal>CPPFLAGS="-I<replaceable>LIBTOOL-INSTALLDIR/include</replaceable>"</literal>
                  and 
                  <literal>LDFLAGS="-L<replaceable>LIBTOOL-INSTALLDIR/lib</replaceable>"</literal>
                  to your environment when compiling with the installer.
