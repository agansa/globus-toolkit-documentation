    <section><title>Security</title>
    <para>
    GRAM requires a host certificate and private key in order for the
    <command>globus-gatekeeeper</command> service to run. These are typically
    located in <filename>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</filename>
    and <filename>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</filename>, but is
    configurable in the gatekeeper configuration file. The key must
    be protected by file permissions allowing only the root user to read it.
    </para>

    <para>
    GRAM also (by default) uses a <filename>grid-mapfile</filename> to authorize
    Grid users as local users. This file is typically located in
    <filename>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</filename>, but is configurable
    in the gatekeeper configuration file.
    </para>

    <para>
    Problems in either of these configurations will show up in the gatekeeper log
    described below.  See the <olink targetdoc="gsic">GSI</olink> documentation
    for more detailed information about obtaining and installing host
    certificates and maintaining a
    <filename>grid-mapfile</filename>.
    </para>

    </section>

    <section><title>Verify that Services are Running</title>
    <para>
    GRAM relies on the <command>globus-gatekeeper</command> program and (in
    some cases) the <command>globus-scheduler-event-generator</command>
    programs to process jobs. If the former is not running, jobs request will
    fail with a connection refused error. If the latter is not running, GRAM jobs
    will appear to "hang" in the <literal>PENDING</literal> state.
    </para>

    <para>
    The <command>globus-gatekeeper</command> is typically started via an init script
    installed in <filename>/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper</filename>. The command
    <command>/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper status</command> will indicate whether the
    service is running. See the
    <olink targetdoc="gram5Admin">GRAM Administrator's Guide</olink> for more information
    about starting and stopping the <command>globus-gatekeeper</command> program.
    </para>

    <para>
    If the <command>globus-gatekeeper</command> service fails to start, the output of the
    command <command>globus-gatekeeper -test</command> will output
    information describing some types of configuration problems.
    </para>

    <para>
    The <command>globus-scheduler-event-generator</command> is typically
    started via an init script installed in
    <filename>/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator</filename>. It is only needed
    when the LRM-specific "setup-seg" package is installed. The command
    <command>/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator status</command> will
    indicate whether the service is running. See the
    <olink targetdoc="gram5Admin">GRAM Administrator's Guide</olink> for more information
    about starting and stopping the <command>globus-scheduler-event-generator</command> program.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section>
    <title>Verify that LRM packages are installed</title>
    <para>
    The <command>globus-gatekeeper</command> program starts the
    <command>globus-job-manager</command> service with different command-line
    parameters depending on the LRM being used. Use the command
    <command>globus-gatekeeper-admin -l</command> to list which LRMs the gatekeeper is
    configured to use.
    </para>

    <para>
    The <command>globus-job-manager-script.pl</command> is the interface between the 
    GRAM job manager process and the LRM adapter. The command
    <command>globus-job-manager-script.pl -h</command> will print the list of
    available adapters.
    </para>

    <para>
    The <command>globus-scheduler-event-generator</command> also uses an LRM-specific
    module to generate scheduler events for GRAM to reduce the amount of resources
    GRAM uses on the machine it is running on. To determine which LRMs are installed
    and configured, use the command
    <command>globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
    If any of these do not show the LRM you are trying to use, install the
    relevant packages related to that LRM and restart the GRAM services. See the
    <olink targetdoc="gram5Admin">GRAM Administrator's Guide</olink> for more information
    about starting and stopping the GRAM services.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section>
    <title>Verify that the LRM packages are configured</title>
    <para>
    All GRAM LRMs have a configuration file, typically located in
    <filename>/etc/globus/gram-<replaceable>LRM</replaceable></filename>. These contain
    some site-specific information, such as queue names, paths to executables needed to 
    interface with the LRM, etc. Check that the values in these files are correct.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section id="gram5-troubleshooting-gatekeeper-log">
    <title>Check the Gatekeeper Log</title>
    <para>
    The <filename>/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log</filename> file 
    contains information about service requests from clients, and will be useful when
    diagnosing service startup failures, authentication failures, and
    authorization failures. 
    </para>

    <section>
    <title>Authorization failures</title>
    <para>
    GRAM uses GSI to authenticate client job requests. If there is a problem
    with the GSI configuration for your host, or a client is trying to connect
    with a certificate signed by a CA your host does not trust, the job request
    will fail. This will show up in the log as a "GSS authentication failure". See the
    <olink targetdoc="gsicAdmin">GSI Administrator's Guide</olink> for information about
    diagnosing authentication failures.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section>
    <title>Gridmap failures</title>
    <para>
    After authentication is complete, GRAM maps the Grid identity to a local user
    prior to starting the <command>globus-job-manager</command> process. If this fails,
    an error will show up in the log as "globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization".
    See the 
    <olink targetdoc="gsicAdmin">GSI Administrator's Guide</olink> for information about
    managing gridmap files.
    </para>
    </section>
    </section>

    <section id="gram5-troubleshooting-jobmanager-log">
    <title>Job Manager Logs</title>
    <para>
    A per-user job manager log is typically located in
    <filename>/var/log/globus/gram_<replaceable>$USERNAME</replaceable>.log</filename>. This
    log contains information from the job manager as it attempts to execute GRAM jobs via
    a local resource manager. The logs can be fairly verbose. Sometimes looking for log entries
    near those containing the string "level=ERROR" will show more information about what
    caused a particular failure.
