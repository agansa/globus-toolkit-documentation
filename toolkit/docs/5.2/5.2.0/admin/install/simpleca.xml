	<title>Installing SimpleCA</title>

	<para>The following are instructions for how to use SimpleCA to set up certificates
		for a GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> installation. </para>
	<para>SimpleCA provides a wrapper around the OpenSSL CA functionality and is sufficient
		for simple Grid services. Alternatively, you can use OpenSSL's <command>CA.sh</command> command
		on its own. SimpleCA is suitable for testing or when a certificate authority
		(CA) is not available. You can find other CA options in
		<olink targetdoc="gtadmin" targetptr="gtadmin-basic-host"/>. </para>

	<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-users" xreflabel="Creating users"><title>Create users </title>
		<para>Make sure you have the following users on your machine:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>Your <emphasis>user</emphasis> account, which will be used to run the client programs.
			</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>A generic <emphasis>globus</emphasis> account, which will be used 
					to perform administrative
				tasks.
				This user will also be in charge of managing the SimpleCA. To do this, make
				sure this account has read and write permissions in the 
				<filename class="directory">$<envar>GLOBUS_LOCATION</envar></filename> directory.

	</section>
	<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-setup" xreflabel="Create your SimpleCA"><title>Create your Simple CA</title>
		<para>A script was installed to set up a new SimpleCA. You only need to run this
			script <emphasis>once</emphasis> per Grid. </para>
		<para>Run the script:</para>
		<screen>/usr/bin/grid-ca-create 
		</screen>
		<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-subjectname" xreflabel="Configure the subject name"><title>2.1 Configure the subject name</title>
			<para>This script prompts you for information about the CA you wish to create:</para>
			<screen>
The unique subject name for this CA is:
cn=Globus Simple CA, ou=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov, ou=GlobusTest, o=Grid

Do you want to keep this as the CA subject (y/n) [y]:</screen>
			<para>where:</para>
			<table>
				<title>CA Name components</title>
				<tgroup cols="2">
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>cn</entry>
							<entry>Represents "common name".  Identifies this particular
								certificate as the CA certificate within the 
								"GlobusTest/simpleCA-hostname" domain,
								which in this case is Globus Simple CA.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>ou</entry>
							<entry>Represents "organizational unit".  Identifies this CA from other
								CAs created by SimpleCA by other people. The second "ou" is
								specific to your hostname (in this cases GlobusTest).</entry>

		<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-email" xreflabel="Configure the CA's email"><title>Configure the CA's email</title>
			<para>The next prompt looks like:</para>
			<screen>
Enter the email of the CA (this is the email where certificate
requests will be sent to be signed by the CA):</screen>
			<para>Enter the email address where you intend to receive certificate requests.
				It should be your real email address that you check, not the address of the
				globus user.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-expiration" xreflabel="Configure the expiration date"><title>Configure the expiration date </title>
			<para>Then you'll see: </para>
			<screen>
The CA certificate has an expiration date. Keep in mind that 
once the CA certificate has expired, all the certificates 
signed by that CA become invalid.  A CA should regenerate 
the CA certificate and start re-issuing ca-setup packages 
before the actual CA certificate expires.  This can be done 
by re-running this setup script.  Enter the number of DAYS 
the CA certificate should last before it expires.
[default: 5 years (1825 days)]:</screen>
			<para>This is the number of days for which the CA certificate is valid. Once this
				time expires, the CA certificate will have to be recreated, and all of its
				certificates regranted. </para>
			<para>Accept the default (recommended). </para>
		</section>
		<section id="gtadmin-simpleca-passphrase" xreflabel="Enter a passphrase"><title>Enter a passphrase</title>
			<para>Next you'll see: </para>
			<screen>
Enter PEM pass phrase:</screen>
			<para>The passphrase of the CA certificate will be used only when signing certificates
				(with <command>grid-cert-sign</command>). It should be hard to guess, as its compromise
				may compromise all the certificates signed by the CA.</para>
			<para>Enter your passphrase. </para>

		<para>You must request and sign a host certificate and then copy it into the appropriate

		<title>Configure SimpleCA for multiple machines </title>
		<para>So far, you have a single machine configured with SimpleCA
			certificates. Recall that in <olink targetptr="gtadmin-simpleca-confirmcert"/>
				 an RPM Source tarball
			CA package was created as <filename>globus_simple_ca_HASH.tar.gz</filename>in your current directory..
			If you want to use your certificates on another machine, you
			must install that CA package on that machine.             
		</para>
		<para>To create an RPM to install on a second machine, run:
			<screen> rpmbuild -ta ./globus_simple_ca_HASH.tar.gz </screen>
		</para>
		<para>This will create a ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/globus_simple_ca_HASH-1.0-1*.rpm which you can copy to your
			second machine and install using the standard RPM commands.
		</para>
		<para>Build files are also included for creating Debian packages for your SimpleCA.</para>
		<para>If you are going to run services on the second host, it will need
			its own <olink targetptr="gtadmin-simpleca-hostcert"/>
	  		and grid-mapfile (as described in the basic configuration instructions
			in <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" targetptr="gtadmin-basic-gridmap"/>).
		</para>
		<para>You may re-use your user certificates on the new host. You will
			need to copy the requests to the host where the SimpleCA was
			first installed in order to sign them.
