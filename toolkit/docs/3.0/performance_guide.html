<h2>Startup and Initialization</h2>





<p>There are a number of initialization operations that can slow down the first

invocation on a service. The container activates all its services on first use,

unless they are explicitly configured to be activated on startup. The first

activation of a service in a JVM is going to be slow since typically a whole set

of jars need to be loaded into memory at that point. The same goes for the a

client application and its first use of a client stub. When factories are

activated, meta data configured for the services are dynamically loaded into

memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To decrease the startup time of a service container you can start it up using

the -lazy argument. This will suppress the default behavior of querying the

container for all its registered services.</p>

<h2>Memory Usage</h2>







<p>A service takes up something in the order of 40kB in active state. In order

to minimize the footprint of the server you can configure your services to be

deactivated when not used. The service will be deactivated after a configurable

TTL value (in seconds) specified in the deployment descriptor of the factory like below:</p>







<p> &lt;parameter name="lifecycleMonitorClass" value="org.globus.ogsa.repository.DefaultServiceDeactivator"/><br>

  &lt;parameter name="instanceDeactivation" value="10000"/>

</p>







<p>Note that even if you deactivate a service some meta data will be available

in order to be able to quickly activate the service again. If you don't want the

container to keep any meta data at all for deactivated services you need to use

a ServiceLoader that minimally needs to recover the handle and the timeout of a

service. Look at the samples/counter/deactivation/CounterFactoryService service

for an example. Note that the ServiceLoader implementation is only used for demo

purposes, so you would need to plug in your own ServiceLoader.</p>







<h2>Invocation Overhead</h2>







<p>On an IBM ThinkPad T22, Pentium II, running Windows 2000 we have seen basic

local machine roundtrip invocation overhead in the order of 5-10ms, and for

basic service creation calls the overhead is around 25-30ms. Activation of a

factory service takes about 130-140ms. Note these numbers should only be used as

ballpark figures when profiling your services built on top of the framework.</p>







<h2>Service Container Profiling</h2>







<p>For programmatic ways to instrument your services look at the <a href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's

Guide</a>.&nbsp; To run an hprof instrumented service container with Suns JDK

you can do as follows:</p>

<p>From the root of the distribution run ant -f build-services.xml

profileContainer. Now you can run clients against the container that exercise

the service you want to profile.</p>

<p>When you are done with profiling you can stop the container using ant

stopContainer. On exit a profile log will be dumped into profile.txt. Note that

the container will run much slower when instrumented.</p>

<p>If you have a source distribution you can test the performance on your

machine using the ant tasks: stressFactory, stressService, and stress&lt;|Coustom|Int|String|&gt;Serialization.

Make sure to run ant buildTest and start up a service container before running

the tests.</p>

<p>The timestamps used in these tests are all based on java System millisecond

probes, and thus different accuracy levels will be available on different

platforms as described at: <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-01/01-qa-0110-timing.html" EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-01/01-qa-0110-timing.html.</a></p>

<h2>Service Container Scalability</h2>







<p>Under heavy load the thread pool in the standalone service container might

need to be customized. </p>

<p>If the server is overloaded you tend to get errors like:<br>

java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out.<br>

To change the timeout value see:<br>

<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout" EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout<br>

<br>

</a>However this does not solve the scalability problem, it just avoids timing

out. You can increase the thread pool size in the container using the global <b>containerThreads</b>

setting in server-config.wsdd. It defaults to 5. The max number of threads then

defaults to 4 * that setting.<br>

Other threading related configs:<br>

<b>containerThreadsMax</b> - max number of threads<br>

<b>containerThreadsHighWaterMark</b> - when the thread pool should start

shrinking (if number of idle threads exceeds this number)<br>

<b>containerThreadsReapInterval</b> - how often killed threads should be cleaned

up</p>

<p>Note these configurations only apply to our standalone container. If you use

a Servlet engine like Tomcat the thread pool features depend on the web

server/servlet implementation.</p>
