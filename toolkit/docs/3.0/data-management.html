<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>Data Management in the Globus Toolkit consists of the following
pieces:</p>

<p><a href="gridftp/">GridFTP</a></p>

<p>GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer
protocol optimized for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The GridFTP
protocol is based on FTP, the highly-popular Internet file transfer
protocol. We have selected a set of protocol features and extensions
defined already in IETF RFCs and added a few additional features to meet
requirements from current data grid projects.</p>

<p><a href="rft/">RFT</a></p>

<p>The Reliable File Transfer Service (RFT) is an OGSA based service that
provides interfaces for controling and monitoring 3rd party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfer
is hosted inside of a grid service so it can be managed using the soft
state model and queried using the ServiceData interfaces available to
all grid services. It is essentially a reliable and recoverable version
of the GT2 globus-url-copy tool and more.</p>

<p><a href="rls/">RLS</a></p>

<p>The Replica Location Service (RLS) maintains and provides access to
mapping information from logical names for data items to target names.
These target names may represent physical locations of data items, or an
entry in the RLS may map to another level of logical naming for the data
item.</p>
