<h2>Identity Determination
</h2>
<p>To determine the identity returned from the GSI libraries, the proxy
certificate chain is walked from PC to EEC (i.e., &quot;first certificate&quot;
is the proxy certificate not CA certificate):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note identity of first certificate that is either not a proxy or whose policy is not
    'impersonation' or 'gt2-limited impersonation, the identity of that proxy is the identity returned by
    GSI.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Note any occurrences of 'gt2-limited impersonation' in chain before certificate with returned identity. If any of these policies
    occur, mark proxy as limited.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>Given the following chain the identity returned should be the identity of the
EEC:</p>
<p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Impersonation) -&gt; Proxy 2 (Impersonation)</p>
<p>Given the following chain, the identity returned should be the identity of
proxy #2:</p>
<p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Impersonation) -&gt; Proxy 2 (Independent)
-&gt; Proxy 3 (Impersonation)</p>
<p>Given the following chain, the identity returned should be the identity of
proxy #1:</p>
<p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Unrecognized policy) -&gt; Proxy 2
(Impersonation)</p>
