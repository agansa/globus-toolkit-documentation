<h2><a name="prereq"></a>Prerequisites </h2>
<p>Before you can install CAS, you must have the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>GT3 Core distribution </li>
  <li> A JDBC compliant database Install </li>
  <li> CAS distribution </li>
</ul>
<p> The CAS service needs to be deployed in some hosting
 environment. The GT3 Core has a stand alone hosting environment that
 may be used. As an alternative, Jakarta Tomcat server maybe used to
 host the service in which case the GT3 Core and the CAS service
 needs to be deployed. Once the CAS service has been deployed and the
 hosting environment has been started up, the service is available for
 use.
   
<p> Typically, a privilege user, say <i>casadmin</i>, owns the
 database, installs GT3 core, deploys the CAS service, bootstraps it
 with data and starts up the service. The URL of the CAS service
 instance is published for the users to contact the service. This
 document describes the instructions to do the same. </p>
   
<p> GT3 install location is referred to as GLOBUS_LOCATION in this
document.

<p> There are two ways the CAS distribution can be obtained and
installed. 
<ul>
<li> As a part of the toolkit release installer. In this case the
Sections <a href="#gt3Core">One</a> and <a href="#casInstall">Two</a>
that describe install of GT3 core and CAS from source can be skipped.
<li> Source distribution of GT3 and CAS installed separately. Section
<a href="#gt3Core">One</a> and <a href="#casInstall">Two</a> describes
the steps for installing this. The CAS install location is referred to
as CAS_HOME in this document. 
</ul>

The instructions from Section Three and later are common to both
types of install.
<h2> <a name="gt3Core"> 1. GT3 Core Install </a> </h2>

Instructions for downloading, installing and configuring GT3 core can
be found <a
href="../../../downloads/3.0.1/">here</a>. More
detailed instructions including required tools and their installation
instructions maybe found <a
href="../admin/">here</a>.


<p>Listed below are commands to build and run container from GT3 core
source distribution. <b>But these may have changed and the documentation
in GT3 core would be the best reference for the same.</b>
 
<p> To build GT3 core,
   
<pre>  casadmin$ cd ogsa/impl/java<br>  casadmin$ ant<br>  casadmin$ ant setup</pre>
   
<h2> <a name="casInstall">2. CAS Install (from source) </a> </h2>

 To check out the source code for CAS from CVS:

<ol>
 <li> To login, 
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/gridservices login</pre> </li>

 <li> At password prompt, hit enter.
 
 <li> To check out trunk code:
<pre> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/gridservices co cas</pre>
</ol>

The top level directory in this check out is referred to as CAS_HOME
in this document.

 The CAS distribution has code for the service, command line clients
 to access the service, tests for backend database access code and
 frontend service, and sample properties files. This section has
 instructions to build and deploy the CAS server into a GT3 container.

<h3> 2.1 Deploying CAS into GT3 container. </h3>

<p> The CAS_HOME/build.properties file needs to be modified or the
 properties need to be overridden with each ant command. The properties
 relevant to deployment are,
   
<ul>
    <li><i>ogsa.root</i>: GT3 core install path.(GLOBUS_LOCATION)  </li>
</ul>
      
<p> The following command in CAS_HOME will build the service and
deploy server side of CAS into the GT3 core. Note, if the container is
already running, it needs to be restarted after the deploy, for the
service to be visible.

<p> For tests also to be deployed, <a
href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">Junit</a> needs to be
installed. The build script requires that &quot;junit.jar&quot; be on
the classpath for the tests to be compiled and deployed. Typically
this is placed in the &quot;lib&quot directory of the Ant install
   
<pre>  casadmin$ ant deployAll <br></pre>

<p> The above target deploys server, client and tests. It also
generates all client scripts and places them in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to be added to the PATH to
be able to execute these scripts from other locations.

<p> To deploy only the client side of CAS, from CAS_HOME 

<pre>  casadmin$ ant deployClient<br></pre>

<p> To deploy only the server, from CAS_HOME 

<pre>  casadmin$ ant deployGar<br></pre>

<h3> <a name="casCreds"> 2.2 Obtaining credentials for CAS server </a> </h3>

<p> The CAS service could run with its own set of credentials. Instructions
 to obtain service credentials may be found <a
 href="../../2.2/admin/guide-user.html#ldapcert">here</a>.

<p> The standard administrator clients that come with the
 distribution can be used to perform host authorization and expect
 that the CAS service have credentials that have service name
 "cas". The command in the above mentioned webpage maybe altered as
 follows,
   
<pre>  casadmin$ grid-cert-request -service <i>cas</i> -host FQDN<br></pre>
      
<p> In this document, the location of certificate and key files is
referred to as CAS_CERT_FILE and CAS_KEY_FILE respectively.

<h2> <a name="dbInstall">3. Database Install and Configuration </a> </h2>
  
CAS uses a backend database to store all user data. Any JDBC compliant
database may be used. This section describes briefly the installation
of such a database and the creation of database using schema required
for CAS backend.

<h3> 3.1 Installing Database </h3>

Any JDBC compliant database may be used. PostgreSQL has been used for
development and testing. The drivers for the same are included in the
distribution. If a different database is used, the corresponding
driver should be added to GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib

<p> Brief instructions to install a JDBC compliant database and
specifically PostGres can be found <a
href="../admin/installation.html">here</a>. For more detailed instructions, please refer to specific database
documentation.

<h3> 3.2 Creating CAS database </h3>

<p> The schema of the database that needs to be created for CAS can be
 found at:
   
<p> GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/databaseSchema/cas_database_schema.sql 
   
<p> To create a database, for example <i>casDatabase</i>, on a PostgreSQL
install on local machine,
    
<pre>  casadmin$ createdb casDatabase <br>  casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/databaseSchema/cas_database_schema.sql</pre>

<p> On running the above command, a list of notices will be seen on
the screen. Unless any of them say "ERROR", these are just output for
information.

<h3><a name="dbConfig"> 3.3 Database configuration file </a></h3> 

 CAS server requires to be configured with a properties file with
 database configuration information. A sample file has been provided
 in the distribution, GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casDBProperties. The values
 need to be modified to suit the particular database install.

 <ul>
     <li><i>dbDriver</i>: Name of the JDBC driver that will be used by
      the CAS install. The default value,
      <i>org.postgresql.Driver</i>, has been set to work with
      PostgreSQL and the driver is shipped with the distribution.
   </li>
     <li><i>dbConnectionURL</i>:   The  URL   to  make   the  database
       connection. For the example,
        <i>jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/casDatabase</i></li>
     <li><i>dbUsername</i>: User name for database access. In this
     example, <i>casadmin</i></li>
     <li><i>dbPassword</i>: Password for the above user</li>
 </ul>
      
<b>Note: Since this file contains the database access username and
password, set appropriate permissions to protect the file. </b>

<h2> <a name="casConfig">4. CAS Configuration </a> </h2>

The CAS service deployed has default values set. Prior to using the
service these values need to be altered to suit the specific install. The
properties described below need to be altered in
GLOBUS_LOCATION/server-config.wsdd

<p> <b>CAS configuration properties:</b>  
   
<ul>
    <li><i>dbPropertiesFilename</i>: Path to file with database
    properties configuration. Details about the file can be found <a
    href="#dbConfig">here</a>.
    <li><i>voDescription</i>: String describing the VO this CAS server is a 
    part of. This is exposed as service data </li>
    <li><i>maximumAssertionLifetime</i>: This value determines the
    maximum lifetime that of the CAS Assertions generated by this
    server can have. It is in seconds. If this property is not set,
    then default value of 24hours is used.  
</ul>

<p> <b>GT3 Core configuration properties:</b> There are quite a few
features supported by GT3 core for service configuration. Two that are
relevant to this service are listed below and are used to configure
the service with credentials of its own as described in <a
href="#casCreds">Section 2.2</a> If these two properties are removed
from the configuration, default credentials are used.

<ul>
    <li><i>serviceCert</i>: Certificate file (CAS_CERT_FILE) </li>
    <li><i>serviceKey</i>: Key file (CAS_KEY_FILE) </li>
</ul>

Refer to <a
href="../gsi/">GT3
Security documentation</a> for more details.

<h2><a name="startHostEnv">5. Starting hosting environment</a></h2>
    
<p> Now the CAS service has been deployed and configured. The hosting
environment needs to be started up. If GT3 standalone container is
used, instructions to start it up are given below. <b>But these may
have changed and the documentation in GT3 core would be the best
reference for the same.</b> If Tomcat or any other hosting environment
is used, refer to specific documentation to start it up.

<p>Prior to running these commands, an environment variable
<i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i> needs to be set to point to GT3 install
location. (GLOBUS_LOCATION in this document)

<p> To <b>start a container</b> on local machine on port number 8888 say, in
 GLOBUS_LOCATION, the following command maybe used.
   
<pre>  casadmin$ bin/globus-start-container -p 8888<br></pre>

If <i>-port</i> is not used, then a container is started up port 8080.

<p> When the <b>container needs to be stopped</b>, the following maybe
 used. If the container is running on local machine on port number
 8888 say, in GLOBUS_LOCATION, the following command maybe used. The
 "hard" option forcefully will shut down the container even if there
 are errors. For more options, use "-help".
   
<pre> casadmin$ bin/globus-stop-container -secure hard http://localhost:8888<br> </pre>

Now, on starting up the container into which the deployment was done,
the CAS service becomes available. If GT3 standalone container was
used, it displays a list of services that have been deployed at
startup. If the CAS service was deployed fine, the CAS URL will be
displayed as described below.

<p>If <i>GT3Host</i> and <i>GT3Port</i> stand for the host and port on
which the container is running, then the URL looks like

<pre>
  http://<i>GT3Host</i>:<i>GT3Port</i>/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService
</pre>

<p> As an example, if the container is running on localhost and port
8888, then the instance URL will look like
<pre>
  http://localhost:8888/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService
</pre>

<p> This instance URL needs to be published for the users to be able to
contact the CAS service. 


<h2> <a name="testing">6. Testing CAS install </a> </h2> 

This is an optional step and if skipped, proceed to section 7, <a
href="#casBootstrap">Bootstrap</a>.

<p>The CAS distribution has two sets of tests built using Junit. For
these test to have been compiled and deployed, Junit needs to be
installed. If you installed usin source distribution, refer to <a
href="#casInstall">section 2</a> of the install. If you used an
installer, ensure that &quot;junit.jar&quot; is on your classpath at
install time.

<ul> 
 <li>Tests for the backend database access functionality.  </li> 
 <li>Tests for the CAS service frontend </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.1 Tests for the backend database access functionality. </h3>

This test does not need any service set up and only requires that a <a
href="#dbInstall">database set up</a> and a file with <a
href="#dbConfig">database configuration</a>. The target used to run
the tests picks up the path to the database configuration file from
the property <i>cas.db.properites</i>. If not overridden with
<i>-Dcas.db.properties</i> option while running the test, the value
defaults to GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casDBProperties.

<p>The database needs to be empty for this test. To delete any
existing entries in the database, a script has been provided in the
distribution. For a PostGres install, the command would be

<pre> casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/database_delete.sql<br></pre>

The following command runs the test,

<pre>  casadmin$ ant -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/cas-build.xml runDatabaseTests<br></pre>

There might some lines output on the screen which start with "ERROR",
but they are not any indication of failure of the test. At the end of
the run, a summary message will be printed indicating number of tests
run and number that failed.  Test report will be generated in
GLOBUS_LOCATION/cas-test-reports. The file will be named
TEST-org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.server.databaseAccess.test.PackageTests.xml

<h3> 6.2 Tests for the CAS service frontend </h3>
    
These tests are targeted at testing the frontend CAS server capability
and also can be used to simulate multi user scenario. <br>

<b><a name="testParams">Test properties:</a></b> It is required that the
CAS service be <a href="#casInstall">deployed</a> and a GT3 container
<a href="#startHostEnv">started</a> up. The tests pick up the host and
port of the GT3 container from following properties:

<ul>
 <li>GT3Host : Host name of the machine on which GT3 container will be
               run for tests. Default, 127.0.0.1
 <li>GT3Port : Port number on which the GT3 container will be run for
              tests. Default, 8080.
</ul>

If in any of the Ant commands below, you are accessing a container not
running in the above said default, use the -D flag in Ant to override
the variable as shown.

<pre> ant &lt;targetName&gt; -DGT3Host="your host name" -DGT3Port="your port number"</pre>

<p>There are two test targets that have been set up which can be run
with different user proxies.  The first test target tests all self
operations and sets up the database for the second user. The second
test target, run with another user's proxy then ensures that the set up
was done correctly. While the first test only requires that the cas
database is bootup with implicit objects only, the second test
requires that the first test to have successfully run.

<p> The steps outlined below also describe how two sets of proxies
(one being an independent proxy) can be generated from one set of
credentials.

<p>Other than the <a href="#dbConfig"/>database configuration file</a>
described for the previous test, this test also uses a test properties
file that is picked up by the target using the property
<i>cas.test.properties</i>. If not overridden with
<i>-Dcas.test.properties</i> it defaults to
GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casTestProperties. The following properties need
to be set in that file,

<ul>
 <li><i>user1SubjectDN: </i> The subject in the proxy that will be used to
 run the first set of tests.</li>
 <li><i>user2SubjectDN: </i> The subject in the proxy that will be used to
 run the second set of tests.</li>
 <li><i>serverDN: </i> The subject DN of the credential used by CAS server</li>
 <li><i>maxAssertionLifetime:</i> The value set as the maximum
 assertion lifetime in server-config.wsdd as shown <a
 href="#casConfig">here</a> 
</ul>
   
<p> <b>Steps to test the CAS install</b>
<p>Ensure cog-jglobus.jar is on the classpath. This jar can be found in
GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib. This can be placed in the classpath by using the
GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.csh script (or bat script in the case of
windows)

<pre>  casadmin$ source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.csh </pre>
<ol>
    <li> In the test properties file, set <i>user2SubjectDN</i> to be
    the subject in your regular proxy. The following returns the
    appropriate string
    <pre>  casadmin$ java org.globus.tools.CertInfo -subject -globus</pre>
    </li>

    <li> Generated an independent proxy using the following
     command. 
    
    <pre>  casadmin$ java org.globus.tools.ProxyInit -independent<br></pre>
  </li>

    <li> Set the identity in the proxy generated from the above step
    as <i>user1SubjectDN</i> in the test properties file. The
    following command will return the relevant string.

    <pre>  casadmin$ java org.globus.tools.ProxyInfo -subject -globus</pre>
    </li> 

    <li> Delete all data from database. The following command would do
    it for a PostGres install with database name <i>casDatabase</i>
    and database username <i>casadmin</i>
    
    <pre> casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/database_delete.sql<br></pre></li>

    <li> Now the database needs to be populated with CAS server
    implicit data for these tests to run. This maybe done using the
    following command. The <i>-d</i> option takes a path to a file
    with database configuration needs to be set as described <a
    href="#dbConfig">here</a>. (If prior steps we done, the file in
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casDBProperties should be set with requires
    values.)

    <pre>  casadmin$ $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/cas-server-bootstrap -d $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casDBProperties -implicit </pre>
    </li>

    <li> Start a GT3 container as described <a
    href="#startHostEnv">here</a>. <pre></pre></li>

    <li> The following command, runs tests for self permissions and
    sets up the database for user with subjectDN that is
    user2SubjectDN. If you are not running container on default
    host/port, set properties as shown <a href="#testParams">here.</a>
            
    <pre>  casadmin$ ant -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/cas-build.xml serverTestsUser1 <br></pre>

    Test report will be generated in
    GLOBUS_LOCATION/cas-test-reports. The file will be named
    TEST-org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.server.test.PackageTests.xml

    </li>

    <li> To test as the second user, generate proxy for the subject DN
    specified for the second user.
    <pre>  casadmin$ java org.globus.tools.ProxyInit <br></pre></li>

    <li> To test as second user, run the following. If you are not
    running container on default host/port, set properties as shown <a
    href="#testParams">here.</a>

    <pre>  casadmin$ ant -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/cas-build.xml serverTestsUser2<br></pre>

    Test report will be generated in
    GLOBUS_LOCATION/cas-test-reports. The file will be named
    TEST-org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.server.test.PostPackageTests.xml
</li>
   
</ol>

After these tests, the CAS database needs to be reset. The following
command will delete all entries from the database.

<pre> casadmin$ psql -U casadmin -d casDatabase -f GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/database_delete.sql<br></pre>

<h2> <a name="casBootstrap">7. CAS Server Bootstrap </a> </h2> 

A client to bootstrap the CAS backend database is in
GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin.

<pre> casadmin$  cas-server-bootstrap [options] -d dbPropFile [ <i>-implicit</i> | -b bootstrapFile]</pre>

where
 
<ul>
<li> options : <ul> <li> -help Prints usage message
                    <li> -debug Runs client with debug trace
	       </ul>
<li> -d dbPropFile : This option specifies a properties file that has
                     database configuration information. The format
                     and properties in the file are described <a
                     href="#dbConfig">here.</a>

<li> -implicit : This option inserts data inherent to the CAS
                 server. It also adds service/action and namespace
                 that can be used with FTP.

<li> -b bootstrapFile : This option adds user specified data to the
                        database. "bootstrapFile" is the path to the
                        file with user data. The user data should have
                        the format specified in
                        GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/bootstrapTemplate. A
                        sample bootstrap file is in
                        GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/bootstrapSample

</ul>

<p><b>Steps to bootstrap the database</b>

<ol>
<li> Copy GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/cas/bootstrapSample to <i>bootstrap</i>
<li> Edit the file <i>bootstrap</i>. This file is used to grant super
user permissions to a CAS user and provide details about the user.

<p>For example say a user with nickname "superUser" using a subject DN
"/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=something/CN=someone" and in a user group called
"suGroup" needs to be added. Moreover say, the user's trust anchor is
"someTrustAnchor" with "X509" as authentication method and a DN
"/C=US/O=something/CN=Some CA". The bootstrap file should look like,

<pre>
ta-name=someTrustAnchor
ta-authMethod=X509
ta-authData=/C=US/O=something/CN=Some CA
user-name=superUser
user-subject=/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=something/CN=someone
userGroupname=suGroup
</pre>

<li>The following command from GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin should populate the
database with data in bootstrap file and implicit data, provided
<i>casDbProperties</i> is configured as described <a
href="#dbConfig">here</a>.

<pre>  casadmin$ cas-server-bootstrap -d GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/casDbProperites -implicit -b bootstrap </pre></li>
</ol>

<b> Now the CAS service has been successfully installed and can be
used.</b> For the users to be able to contact the CAS service, the
instance URL needs to be made available. If the hosting environment in
which the installation was done is up and running on <i>localhost</i>
port <i>8888</i>, then the instance URL will be <pre>
http://localhost:8888/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService </pre>
