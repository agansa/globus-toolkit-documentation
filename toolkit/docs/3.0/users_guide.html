<h2>

1&nbsp;<a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>





<p>This User's Guide describes how to setup the toolkit, and how to run the 
  
samples.
  
For a detailed description of how to write a
  
Grid service please refer to the <a 

href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's
  
Guide.</a> The current implementation is based on
  
the GGF <a href="http://www.ggf.org/ogsi-wg/">Open Grid Services Infrastructure
  
v1.0</a> specification ( Draft 29,&nbsp; released on April 5, 2003).
  
The toolkit comes both in a source-, and a binary distribution.
  
The source distribution contains source for the core framework as well as all
  
samples, whereas the binary distribution only has the source for the samples.
  
When downloading the source you can easily build your own binary distribution
  
to work with. The build and development environment is largely the same
  
in both distributions. For consistency this guide assumes you have a binary
  
distribution (either downloaded from the web, or created from a source cvs
  
checkout) unless otherwise stated. The binary distribution does not require
  
you to download any external tools to run the samples (apart from a Java
  
VM), we however recommend that you also in this case download the build
  
system we are using (ant), in order to make it easier to build, and deploy
  
the samples, as well as writing your own services. </p>
<p>Document conventions:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;ogsa root&gt; refers to the location where you unpacked the distribution </li>
  <li>&lt;ogsa java root&gt; refers to the java root of the distribution. In
        
the source distribution case this is &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java and in the
        
binary distribution it is the same as &lt;ogsa root&gt;
        
</li>
  <li>&lt;source dir&gt; this is the directory where the source resides, so
          
in the binary distribution it will be 'samples', and in the source distribution
          
it will be 'src'. </li>
</ul>

2.3 Distributed Tools</h3>





<p>Our framework ships with a number of external tools. They are automatically
  
picked up, so in general you don't have to worry about these. We mention
  
the tools here for reference purposes, it is <b>not</b> recommended to
  
replace any of these tools by another version you may already have.

<h3>

2.4 Quick Start</h3>





<p>If you have a binary distribution, and you just want to test and run the
  
demo and samples quickly (without downloading any external tools) then
  
you can do the following:
  
</p>
<ol>





<li>

Start the grid service container by typing: globus-start-container -p 8080

(Starts up a server on port 8080)</li>



<li>

Run the demo client by typing: globus-service-browser <a 

href="http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/core/registry/ContainerRegistryService?WSDL">http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/core/registry/ContainerRegistryService</a></li>

</ol>





<p>For a guide on how to use the ServiceBrowser demo see section 3
  
</p>
<h3>

2.5 Installing the Build System</h3>





<p>In order to build the source distribution or the samples in the binary
  
distribution you would need to download Jakarta Ant. We also use Ant as
  
a scripting tool to simplify testing and deployment.
  
</p>
<ol>





<li>

Download Ant 1.5 distribution from <a 

href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant</a></li>



<li>

Unzip ant into your preferred location and set the ANT_HOME environment

to point to this location</li>



<li>

Put junit.jar (download from <a href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>)

into ANT_HOME/lib (only

necessary if you want to run the tests in the source distribution)</li>



<li>

Add ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH environment</li>

</ol>







<h3>

2.6 Creating a Binary Distribution from a Source Distribution</h3>







<ol>





<li>

Go to the &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java directory</li>



<li>

type: ant dist</li>



<li>

A binary distribution will be placed in &lt;ogsa 

root&gt;/impl/java/build/ogsa-&lt;version&gt;</li>

</ol>







<h3>

2.7 Running the Samples using Ant</h3>







<ol>





<li>

Run the standalone service container by typing: ant startContainer 

[-Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt;]</li>



<li>

Run the demo client by typing: ant gui [-Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt;]</li>

</ol>





<p>Note, you can set the service.port property in the &lt;ogsa java 
  
root&gt;/ogsa.properties
  
file to change the port the service container will listen on (default is
  
8080). Alternatively you can pass in -Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt; on the command
  
line. To stop the container use ant stopContainer or send it a kill
  
signal.. </p>
<h3>

2.8 Tomcat Installation</h3>





<p>You can run the entire framework and all the samples inside of the standalone
  
service container we provide. However it was mainly designed for testing
  
purposes, so the framework can&nbsp; also be deployed in tomcat. </p>
<ol>





<li class="MsoNormal" style="">

Type ant -Dtomcat.dir=&lt;tomcat root&gt; deployTomcat</li>



<li class="MsoNormal" style="">

Add .wsdl and .xsd MIME types to Tomcat server edit &lt;tomcat 

root&gt;/conf/web.xml

file and add the following (anywhere in the web-app):</li>

</ol>







<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mime-mapping&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension&gt;gwsdl&lt;/extension&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mime-type&gt;text/xml&lt;/mime-type&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/mime-mapping&gt;</pre>







<pre>    &lt;mime-mapping&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension&gt;wsdl&lt;/extension&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mime-type&gt;text/xml&lt;/mime-type&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/mime-mapping&gt;</pre>







<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mime-mapping&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&lt;extension&gt;xsd&lt;/extension&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&lt;mime-type&gt;text/xml&lt;/mime-type&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/mime-mapping&gt;</pre>





<p>When using the Sun Java Hotspot VM you may also want to increase your heap
  
space for the tomcat engine.
  
  <br>
  

  
You can do this by setting the -Xmx flag to for instance -Xmx128m (128
  
MB max heap) in the CATALINA_OPTS environment.
  
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a known problem with the

AxisServlet in Tomcat causing an empty document to be returned with a successful

HTTP status if the tomcat configuration is broken. To debug it further

please check the tomcat logs in &lt;tomcat root&gt;/logs/ or the log4j logs

in the server (see section 7). The error returned to the client will be

a SaxException and look something like: 'Line=1: The root element is required

in a well-formed document'.

</p>



<p>By default the ogsi servlet runs in the ogsa/services app, and the schemas

are picked up from the ROOT context (&quot;/&quot;). In order to change this you

can modify the WEB-INF/web.xml file, for example:&nbsp;

</p>



<pre>&lt;servlet&gt;

  &lt;servlet-name&gt;OgsiServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;

  &lt;display-name&gt;OGSI Container Servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;

  &lt;servlet-class&gt;

    org.globus.ogsa.server.OgsiServlet

  &lt;/servlet-class&gt;

  &lt;init-param&gt;

    &lt;param-name&gt;ogsiLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;

    &lt;param-value&gt;ogsa-test/services/&lt;/param-value&gt;

  &lt;/init-param&gt;

  &lt;init-param&gt;

    &lt;param-name&gt;schemaContext&lt;/param-name&gt;

    &lt;param-value&gt;ogsa-test&lt;/param-value&gt;

  &lt;/init-param&gt;

&lt;/servlet&gt;</pre>



<p><code>ogsiLocation</code> specifies the new path to the web app, and <code>schemaContext </code>specifies
  what context should be used to pick up the schema files.</p>



<h2>

3&nbsp;<a name="Samples"></a>Samples</h2>







<h3>

3.1 Sample Code</h3>





<p>The sample WSDL and XML Schemas are located in &lt;ogsa root&gt;/schema/samples.
  
The source code is located in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source 
  
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/impl/samples.
  
In the binary distribution source dir is 'samples', and in the source 
  
distribution
  
it is 'src'. To build the samples type: ant samples. Many samples have
  
simple command line client demos in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source 
  
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/impl/samples/&lt;sample&gt;/client
  
and gui clients in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source 
  
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/gui. </p>

<h3>

3.3 Service Browser GUI</h3>





<p>The service browser gui is designed using the Web Browser metaphor. You
  
can type in a URL (which is a GSH) to inspect and use a remote service,
  
which will be rendered in the GUI. The GUI framework retrieves the WSDL
  
document for the GSH (displayed in the WSDL tab) and maps Port Types exposed
  
by this WSDL to GUI panes. If an appropriate GUI pane cannot be matched
  
with a given Port Type, a dynamic pane can be used which shapes itself
  
according to the methods exposed by the Port Type. Note in this case you will
  
need to add type mappings explicitly to client-config.wsdd if you use complex
  
types. The encoded counter sample can be used to showcase this with the dynamic
  
gui if you enable client deployment in the build-samples.xml file.
  
</p>
<p>Look for a ServiceGroup Inspection pane to get a list of services exposed

by an ServiceGroup service. The entries in this list can be viewed as service

links, and by double clicking on the entries you follow the link and render

the target service interface in the GUI.

</p>



<p>If a factory service is rendered, you can create new transient service

instances that will be introspected the same way as described above.

</p>

<h2>

5&nbsp;<a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>





<p>This sections described the OGSA extensions to the server-config.wsdd file
  
used by Apache Axis.
</p>
<h3>Global options </h3>
<p>Global Options are defined&nbsp; in the &lt;globalConfiguration&gt; element.

The configuration item (in bold) corresponds to the 'name' attribute in

a parameter sub element, and the value is put as a 'value' attribute within

the same parameter element:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>  <b>schemaRoot </b>&lt;url&gt;</dt>
  <dd>You can use this option if you want
      
the container to read it's schema from a remote server (this can be useful
      
especially for clients so that you don't have to copy around the whole
      
schema directory to the location where you run the client) </dd>
  <dt>  <b>containerThreads </b>&lt;number of threads&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Sets the number of
        
threads used in the standalone container.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>&lt;protocol&gt;Port </b>&lt;port&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Port used to expose services 
          
running
          
a particular protocol, e.g httpPort or httpgPort. In general the port is 
          
determined 
          
dynamically but in certain cases it must be defined explicitly (e.g. when 
          
deploying to Tomcat).</dd>
  <dt>  <b>logicalHost</b> &lt;hostname&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Hostname to use instead of default
            
local host, can be both FQDN and just hostname.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>publishHostName</b> &lt;true/false&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If true (case insensitive)
              
the hostname will be published instead of the IP.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>domainName</b> &lt;domain name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Domain name to append to host
                
name if publishHostName is set and logicalHost is not qualified by a domain.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>disableDNS</b> &lt;true/false&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If true (case insensitive) no
                  
DNS lookups will be attempted and the logicalHost or 'localhost' will be
                  
published.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Persistent Services options</h3>
<p>Persistent Services Options are defined in a &lt;service&gt; tag:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>  <b>persistent </b>&lt;true/false&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Flag indicating whether to treat
      
this service as a persistent grid service, i.e it will be instantiated
      
at container start-up. </dd>
  <dt>  <b>schemaPath</b> &lt;path&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Path inside of http server where wsdl
        
for the persistent service is defined.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>sweepDelay </b>&lt;delay in milliseconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Delay between factory
          
sweeps to destroy timed out service instances.</dd>
  <dt>  <b>handleProtocol</b> &lt;protocol&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Protocol used to publish handles.
            
Note, that if a non default (http is default) protocol is selected, it
            
is recommended to accompany this configuration with a global configuration
            
of &lt;protocol&gt;Port. See above. Only https and http are allowed in the
            
current OGSA specification. </dd>
  <dt>  <b>lifecycle</b> &lt;true/false&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Flag indicating whether
              
instances are to be checkpointed into the deployment descriptor to maintain
              
state between server lifecycles. <br>
    <br>
    If instance- is prepended to the property name
      it will configure the
    
instances of the configured service (in case of a factory service) as opposed
      to
    
the service itself. For a further discussion of configuration variables see the 
    
<a href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's
    
Guide</a> or look at the properties defined in org.globus.ogsa.ServiceProperties
    
in the API documentation.
    
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Java System options </h3>
<p>In the case of the standalone container some java System properties can be
  
set to customize where the schemas will be picked up:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <b>-Dorg.globus.ogsa.schema.root</b></dt>
  <dd>Tells the process what remote url can
      be
    used to fetch the schemas.</dd>
  <dt>
    <b>-Dorg.globus.ogsa.server.webroot</b></dt>
  <dd>Tells the standalone http server
      where
    in the file system the HTTP GET requests should be redirected&nbsp; (must
    be
absolute path).</dd>
</dl>
<h2>

6&nbsp;<a name="Logging and Debugging"></a>Logging and Debugging</h2>



<H3>Overview</H3>

<p>Logging in the Globus Toolkit is based on the Jakarta Commons Logging architecture.
  
Commons Logging provides a consistent interface for instrumenting source code while  
  
at the same time allowing the user to plug-in a different logging implementation.
  
The Globus Toolkit implements the Commons Logging interface and provides the logging implementation.
  
</p>
<P>

In addition the Globus Toolkit provides a logging Grid Service with the following features:

<UL>

<LI>Dynamically change the runtime logging characteristics of both the hosting environment 

and the services running in it.

<LI>Change the persistent logging configuration.

<LI>Query or subscribe to a rolling window of the log entries as service data.

<LI>Query transient and persistent attributes as service data.

<LI>Access to and management of logging as a Grid Service.

</UL>



<H3>Logging Configuration</H3>

<p>Basic logging is automatically configured and enabled during installation.
  
No additional configuration is needed to enable logging.
  
This section is provided so that administrators can change the logging configuration if needed.    
  
</p>
<P>

This section describes only the static configuration of logging.

The OgsiLogging service can be used to dynamically change the logging configuration and options at runtime.

This can done using the service interface from a Grid Service client application.

A panel is provided as part of the ServiceBrowser as an exmaple.

For details see the logging service detailed specification.

<P>

The following files are used to configure logging:

<UL>

    <LI>commons-logging.properties 

    <LI>ogsilogging_parms.properties

    <LI>ogsilogging.properties

</UL>



<H4>commons-logging.properties</H4>

This file is used by Jakarta Commons to find the LogFactory to use when creating Loggers.

It must be in the classpath.   This is the entire content:

<XMP>

    org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory=org.globus.ogsa.impl.core.logging.OGSALogFactory

</XMP>

<p>If the commons-logging.properties file is not found, 
  
and assuming a factory was not specified in the system properties,
  
the behavior of commons LogFactory is to dynamically discover built-in supported
  loggers. 
If the log4j-core.jar file is found in the classpath, log4j will be used. 
  
See the commons Logging LogFactory javadoc for details regarding LogFactory implementation
  lookup.
  

  
  </p>
<H4>ogsilogging_parm.properties</H4>



<p>This file contains 2 parameters: 
  
</p>
<p>

1. <i>persistentAttributeLocation</i> contains the name of the file which contains the detailed logging configuration.

It can be fully qualified or relative to the current directory.

In this example the file is located in the current directory.

<XMP>

    persistentAttributeLocation=ogsilogging.properties 

</XMP>

<p>

2. <i>logDestinationBasePath</i> contains the base path of log files for any logger with a file

desination.

The default setting is blank, which means the current working directory. 

In the default Globus Toolkit container, this defaults to the <CODE>&lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java/</CODE> directory.

<XMP>

    logDestinationBasePath=

</XMP>

 

<H4>ogsilogging.properties</H4>



<p>This file contains the detailed logging settings for a Globus Toolkit installation.
  
</p>
<p>

There is one and only one default setting, which has the following format:

<XMP>

    default=destination,level,group

</XMP>

The  "default" entry provides logging settings for any logger that is not explicitly 

defined elsewhere in the ogsilogging.properties file.



<P>In addition to the default entry, there are configuration entries for individual loggers.

Individual Logger entries have the following format:</p>
 
<pre>logger_name=destination,level,group</pre>
<P>

  <i>Logger name</i>

  <BR>

logger_name is a string that matches what the log generating application used to define it's logging entries.

It is typically the class name of the application generating the log information, but it can be

any name that binds a set of contributors to an identified log stream. 

<p>

<i>Level</i>

<BR>

The level is the key log-filtering item.

There are two views of level: the application view, and the administrative view.

From the standpoint of the log generating application,

it selects one of the following levels indicating the log message priority:

<UL>

<LI>DEBUG

<LI>TRACE

<LI>INFO

<LI>WARN

<LI>ERROR

<LI>FATAL

</UL>



<p>From the administrative view, the level attribute contained in this file is used for the hierarchical filtering of log message flows.
  
Valid level attributes, in hierarchical order are:
  
</p>
<UL>

<LI>ALL or DEBUG

<LI>TRACE

<LI>INFO

<LI>WARN

<LI>ERROR

<LI>FATAL

<LI>OFF

</UL>

<p>The administrator will set a level associated with a logger name from one of the above.
  
The selection of a particular level enables all log filters below it.
  
For example, setting level to ALL or DEBUG  causes all messages to be logged.
  
Setting the level to TRACE also causes INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL level messages to be logged.
  
Setting level to  INFO causes  WARN, ERROR, FATAL level messages to be logged, and so on.
  
</p>
<P>Setting level to "OFF" disables all log messages for this logger.

<p>

<i>Destination</i>

<BR>

The destination field is either "CONSOLE" or filename.

The filename is relative and will be pre-pended by the logDestinationBasePath.

<p>

<i>Group</i>

<BR>

This is an unmanaged tag, which can be used in group wide operations.

An attribute can only belong to one group.

Group is useful when programmatically changing the logging settings for a group of loggers.


<H4>Configuring The Logging Service</H3>

The OgsiLogging Grid Service is defined in the server-config.wsdd.

Following are the configurable parameters:

</h4>

<P><I>logBufferSize</I> defines the number of entries in the log messages buffer.

The log message buffer is a rolling (FIFO) list of the latest log messages. 

<xmp>

  <parameter name="logBufferSize" value="12"/>

</XMP>

<P><I>logBufferSizeMax</I> defines the maximum size of any change in log buffer size.

<XMP>

  <parameter name="logBufferSizeMax" value="1000"/>

</XMP>



<H4>Underlying Log Engine</H4>



<p>Ogsi Logging uses Log4j in it's implementation.
  
The log4j-core.jar file should be in the classpath.
  
</p>
<P>

Any application using log4j directly instead of using commons APIs will NOT be supported from a logging management standpoint.

Any discovered log4j.properties file will be in effect for direct users.

Commons users will have OGSI Logging Management prevail and existing log4j.properties files will have no effect.

For example, if a category logger is defined in log4j as DEBUG

but is defaulted by an ogsilogging.properties as WARN, then WARN is the designated log level.





<H4>Logging in Tomcat</H4>

<P>

The deployTomcat target takes care of all the required logging setup in the Tomcat

application server environment.



<H4>Tracing SOAP messages</H4>

<p>Three methods for tracing SOAP messages are described.
  
</p>
<p>1. To trace SOAP messages on the wire you can use TcpMon from Apache

Axis. After setting the environment using <a href="#Setenv">setenv scripts</a> you can run:

<xmp>

    java org.apache.axis.utils.tcpmon [listenPort targetHost targetPort]

</XMP>

<p>If no arguments are used, you have to fill out these values in the GUI.



<p>2. One method for logging SOAP messages is to add the

<CODE>org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler</CODE> to the request or response chain

in the server-config.wsdd or client-config.wsdd files. For example:

</p>



<pre>&lt;requestFlow&gt;

  ...

  &lt;handler type=&quot;java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler&quot;/&gt;

  ...

&lt;requestFlow&gt;</pre>

<P>3. Another method for tracing SOAP messages is to enable logging for selected Axis classes.

Add the following lines to the ogsilogging.properties file:

<XMP>

    org.apache.client.Call=console,debug

    org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender=console,debug

</XMP>

This will cause axis client side calls and Axis HTTP messages to be logged.

7&nbsp;<a name="Security Support"></a>Security Support</h2>





<p>

We support both transport level and message level security based on GSI, and

WS-Security. For more details look at a description of the current <a href="security.html">security

support</a>.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>

8&nbsp;<a name=".NET Support"></a>.NET Support</h2>





<p>The .NET code is only available in the source distribution, and it only
  
supports OGSA clients. It makes use of the exact same WSDL and XML Schemas
  
as the Java implementation for all the samples and core infrastructure
  
components. The wsdl.exe tool is used for proxy generation and the xsd.exe
  
tool is used to compile the XML Schemas into C# types.
  
</p>
<p>In &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/dotnet/client there are some experimental .NET

SDK Framework clients. When building the clients, WSDL is inspected from

a web server pointed to by the OGSA_SERVER environment variable (run setenv.bat

to get default value). Type nmake to build the clients, and nmake test

to run some tests against a server running an OGSA container.

</p>



<p>&lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/dotnet/client/gui also contains a simple ServiceBrowser

developed in Visual Studio .NET. Note, you have to build the client dlls

described in the previous step before building the gui.

</p>



<p>The Grid Computing Group at the University of Virginia provides GSI extension

to our code and a technology preview of an OGSI hosting environment for the .NET
  platform. Please visit: <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~humphrey/GCG/ogsi.net.html">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~humphrey/GCG/ogsi.net.html</a>

for more details.</p>



<h2>

9&nbsp;<a name="Web Start Support"></a>Web Start Support</h2>





<p>You can create a Java Web Start
  
enabled proof of concept distribution of ogsa core and samples by doing the
  
following:
  
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using the source distribution compile using the &quot;ant webstart&quot; command.</li>
  <li> Copy the directory &quot;ogsaweb&quot; to the web server you wish to
    host the
implementation. (if you use our standalone server you can skip this step and
    go
directly to step 4)</li>
  <li> Ensure the the mime type &quot;application/x-java-jnlp-file jnlp&quot; exists
    
in your target web server configuration (on Apache - /etc/mime.types)</li>
  <li> Edit the ogsa.jnlp file to include the web server host address and
    the
address where you have deployed the ContainerRegistryService (this is the last
      
host configuration in the file).</li>
  <li> Edit the bc.jnlp file to include the web server host address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before running the container startup script you need to set&nbsp; -Dorg.globus.ogsa.server.webstart=enable

in your OPTIONS shell environment variable (see section 11 command line clients

for details).</p>
<p>You should now be able to point your browser at &lt;web server host&gt;/ogsaweb/ogsa.jnlp

to start the ServiceBrowser GUI client from a remote machine not configured to

use OGSA.. We have tested the web start sample with JDK 1.3.1, and WebStart

1.0.1.</p>

<h2>

10&nbsp;<a name="EJBServices"></a>EJB Services</h2>





<p>We provide a code generator that allows you to expose already existing
  
Enterprise Java Beans, EJBs (both Session Beans and Entity Beans), as Grid
  
services inside of an EJB container in a J2EE Application server. For more
  
details on how to use the code generator see [<a href="ejb_services.html">ejb
  
code gen</a>].</p>
<h2>11 <a name="CommandLineClient"></a>Command Line Clients</h2>

<p>We provide a minimal set of generic command line clients that can be used to

test your grid services. The command line clients for core are implemented in

the org.globus.ogsa.client package. </p>

<p> To generate the command-line scripts for your target platform,

type <b>ant setup</b>. The scripts are generated in the bin/ directory.

For a given command-line tool, the corresponding script takes care

of setting the classpath and specifying the Java class name. You need to set the

GLOBUS_LOCATION variable in your shell. Note for Windows users it may happen

that you run out of environment variable character length. If you do you can use

the <b>subst</b> command to map the actual GLOBUS_LOCATION to a volume (e.g. subst f:

&lt;your globus location&gt;). On Unix/Linux you can use similar workarounds

using <b>ln -s</b>, if the problem occurs.

<h2>12 <a name="ScriptGeneration"></a>Command Line Script Generation</h2>

<p>

It is sometimes needed to launch a Java class from the command-line. 

Bourne Shell and Windows batch scripts can be automatically generated

in order to hide from the user the setting of the classpath and the

specification of the Java class.

An example of this is the generation of the

<a href="#CommandLineClient">command-line clients</a> provided with

the platform.

</p>

<p>

To provide automatic generation of a client script, write an ant target

that calls the <i>generateLauncher</i> ant target in build-client.xml.

The following properties/parameters must be specified:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>${launcher-name}</i>: base name of script to generate.</li>

<li><i>${class-name}</i>: name of Java class the script must call.</li>

</ul>

<p>

For instance:

</p>

<pre>

    &lt;ant antfile=&quot;build-client.xml&quot; target=&quot;generateLauncher&quot;

         dir=&quot;${ogsa.root}&quot;&gt;

        &lt;property name=&quot;launcher-name&quot; value=&quot;myClient&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;property name=&quot;class-name&quot; value=&quot;org.mypackage.MyClient&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;/ant&gt;

</pre>

<p>It is also possible to specify defaults JVM options and command-line
  
using the <i>${default.jvm.options}</i> and <i>${default.cmd.line}</i> ant
  
properties.
  

  
</p>
<h2>13 <a name="Setenv"></a>Setenv Scripts</h2>



<p>The setenv scripts can be used to set the proper classpath environment variable
  in order to launch a Java class from the command-line. To run the setenv script
  you must first set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable. The GLOBUS_LOCATION
should be set to the location of the GT3 distribution. </p>
<p>To set the classpath
on Windows execute:</p>
<pre>%GLOBUS_LOCATION%\setenv.bat</pre>
<p> On Unix/Linux machines
    execute:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>for bash/sh</p>
  <pre>. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setenv.sh</pre>
    <p>for csh/tcsh</p>
  <pre>source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setenv.csh</pre>
