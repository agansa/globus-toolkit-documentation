<h1>Resource Management (GRAM)</h1>

<p>The Globus Toolkit includes a set of service components collectively
referred to as the Globus Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM).   GRAM
simplifies the use of remote systems by providing a single standard
interface for requesting and using remote system resources for the
execution of "jobs".  The most common use (and the best supported use)
of GRAM is remote job submission and control.  This is typically used
to support distributed computing applications.</p>

<p>For most Grid-based projects, we recommend using GRAM as a project-wide
standard for remote job submission and resource management.</p>

<p>GRAM is designed to provide a single common protocol and API for
requesting and using remote system resources, by providing a uniform,
flexible interface to, local job scheduling systems. The Grid Security
Infrastructure (GSI) provides mutual authentication of both users
and remote resources using GSI (Grid-wide) PKI-based identities. GRAM
provides a simple authorization mechanism based on GSI identities and
a mechanism to map GSI identities to local user accounts.</p>

<p>GRAM reduces the number of mechanisms required for using remote
resources (such as remote compute systems).  Local systems may use a
wide variety of management mechanisms (schedulers, queuing systems,
reservation systems, and control interfaces), but users and application
developers need to learn how to use only one (*GRAM*) to request and
use these resources. This capability is consistent with the "hourglass"
role played by most of the Globus Toolkit's components: GRAM is the neck
of the hourglass, with applications and higher-level services (such as
resource brokers or metaschedulers) above it and local control and access
mechanisms below it, as shown in the below figure. Both sides need work
only with GRAM, so the number of interactions, APIs, and protocols that
need to be used are greatly reduced.</p>

<p>We expect GRAM to continue evolving rapidly within the OGSI setting
(GT3 GRAM), as its protocol is standardized, and as richer job description
and resource provisioning capabilities are added.</p>

<p>GRAM does not provide scheduling or resource brokering capabilities.
A wide variety of metaschedulers and resource brokers that leverage
GRAM mechanisms have been developed by other projects for the GT2 GRAM.
Due to its recent June/July release, GT3 GRAM may not yet have been
integrated into the various metaschedulers and resource brokers.  However,
we expect these applications will be updated to use GT3 GRAM.</p>

<p>GRAM does not provide accounting and billing features.  It is assumed
that these features-if needed-are being supplied by local management
mechanisms such as a queuing system or scheduler.</p>

<h2>GT3 3.0 GRAM Docs</h2>

<p>The Globus Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM) is the lowest level of
Globus resource management architecture. GRAM allows you to run jobs
remotely, using a set of WSDL/OGSI client interfaces for submitting,
monitoring, and terminating a job. Job requests are written by the user
in the Resource Specification Language (RSL) and processed by the
ManagedJobService as part of the job request.</p>
