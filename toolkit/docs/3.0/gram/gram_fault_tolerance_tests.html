Kill Master = ctrl-c in Master terminal
Kill UHE = 2 methods are possible:
                call admin service shutdown
                kill -9 UHE process
job completes = client receives DONE notification
submit a job = managed-job-globusrun -factory xxx -file yyy
submit a batch job = managed-job-globusrun -batch -factory xxx -file yyy
FSD = FindServiceData call; managed-job-globusrun -status <job contact>
job contact = GSH returned from managed-job-globusrun -batch

The below set of tests cases should be done for both fork and a scheduler 
(e.g. pbs, lsf).
<br> All these test were done on code from cvs trunk as of Nov 11, 2003.

<b>test case 1 - Only MHE crash:</b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - Submit a job (UHE starts up)
  - Job completes
  - Kill Master
  - Restart Master (UHE still active)
      (Ping is failing even though UHE is up: Ravi investigating)
      -- This is fixed and committed to Trunk
      (Ping should not fail if UHE is active)
  - Submit a job
  - Job completes
  -- This test was tested and found to work with Fork.

<b>test case 2 - Both MHE and UHE crash:</b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - Submit a job (UHE starts up)
  - Job completes
  - Kill Master
  - Kill UHE
  - Restart Master (UHE is restarted)
  - Submit a job
  - Job completes
-- This case is tested and found to work 

<b> test case 3 - UHE crash; no jobs: </b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - UHE is killed (no jobs at the time)
  - Restart handler in MHE restarts UHE
  - Submit a job (UHE starts up)
  - Job completes
--This case is found to work fine.

The UHEActivity Sweeper task does not seem to work.So UHEs going away after a
period of 2 hours of inactivity is br0ken.This needs to be fixed which will be 
done as part of making changes that were prompted by Sam's changes to Admin 
Service. So all through the following tests the UHE will be killed by the 
handler after a period of 15 mins for testing recovery of jobs.


<b> test case 4 - UHE crash, long job, subscribe:</b>
----------------------------------
I configured the UHESweeperTask ( that periodically sweeps all the uhes and pin
gs whether they are active or not ) to sweep the uhes every 5 seconds. I killed
the UHE by fishing out its pid from ps -efwww | grep <port> of uhe process.

- Master is up
  - Submit a long running sleep job
     Waits for DONE notification
  - UHE is killed (1 active job)
  - Restart handler in MHE restarts UHE
  - job completes on service side
  - Client receives DONE

This case works fine 
<b>test case 5 - UHE crash, long job, FSD: </b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - Submit a long running sleep job - batch
  - UHE is killed (1 active job)
  - Restart handler in MHE restarts UHE
  - client does a FSD with job contact (GSH) and gets ACTIVE
  - job completes on service side
  - client does a FSD with job contact (GSH) and gets DONE

  This case is similar to case 4.I verified that UHE is restarted and notificat
  ions from UHE reach the client fine.

<b>test case 6 - UHE inactivity shutdown 1:</b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - Submit a simple /bin/date job
  - Job completes
  - UHEActivitySweeper shuts down UHE
  - Submit a simple /bin/date job
    + verifies UHE startup works after shutdown
-- This works too.

<b>test case 7 - UHE inactivity shutdown 2:</b>
----------------------------------
  - Master is up
  - Submit a simple /bin/date job
  - Job completes
  - do FSD to UHE MJFS to keep UHE up even though there are no more instances
  - stop doing FSD allowing the UHEActivitySweeper to shut down UHE
  - Submit a simple /bin/date job
    + verifies UHE startup works after shutdown
-- As i mentioned earlier the Task that shuts down inactive uhe needs more work
to make it work as we wanted it to ( which would also include incorporating Sam
's changes ).I made the UHE shutdown itself after some time and submitted a jobi
which restarts the UHE and jobs go through fine.
