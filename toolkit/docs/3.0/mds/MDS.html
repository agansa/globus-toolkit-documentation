<p>MDS, the Monitoring and Discovery Service, has been a major 
component of the Globus Toolkit since its inception.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With GT3, MDS  changes in 
fundamental ways, but Information Services still remain a key part of the 
toolkit.&nbsp; Some MDS functionality is subsumed by the OGSI core framework, 
some information sources are merged with domain-specific resource-layer 
services, and some of MDS manifests as higher-level services, such as a 
collective-layer Index Service similar to an MDS2 GIIS.</p>
<h2><b>
Connectivity Layer Behavior</b></h2>
<p>The OGSI core in GT3  provides 
a generic interface for mapping <b>Service Data</b> queries and <b>subscriptions</b> for 
Service Data notification to service implementation mechanisms.&nbsp; In essence, 
this subsumes the role of the GRIS backend server module in MDS, while relying 
on more basic OGSA binding mechanisms for secure access to the query interface 
in place of the GSI-enabled LDAP protocol.&nbsp; The OGSA subscription mechanism is an 
enhancement over the polling query model of MDS, comparable to an LDAP extension 
called “persistent query.”</p>
<p>The OGSI core Service Data query 
behavior is exposed as a set of optional, higher-level, programming APIs within 
the GT3 service development environment.&nbsp; A service implementation can use as 
much, or as little, of the generic data-handling behavior as the designer 
chooses.</p>
<h2>
<b>Resource Layer Behavior</b></h2>
<p>GT3 base service implementations such as 
GRAM and RFT provide relevant Service Data.&nbsp; These Service Data sources within 
the base service implementations subsume the role of per-component information 
providers (such as the GRAM reporter) in MDS.</p>
<p>The base service implementations  expose status 
information as well as probed, measured, or discovered platform information 
according to well-defined <b>Service Data Descriptions</b> in their Service Type WSDL.&nbsp; These Service Data Descriptions in the WSDL, used to standardize the information 
exchange between providers and consumers within specific service domains, 
subsume the role of MDS schema written in the RFC2252 LDAP schema format.</p>
<h2>
Collective Layer Behavior</h2>
<p>The Index 
Service components in GT3 provide the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>A generic 
framework for aggregation of Service Data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>A specific 
instance of an Index Service representing multiple resources</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To present the generic aggregation framework, the logical 
structure of the Index Service can be described by the following diagram:</p>

    <p>The <b>Resource</b> Layer consists of 
    one or more Grid Services that produce Service Data, which can be sent by 
    subscription to an <b>Aggregator</b> mechanism in the Index Service (which 
    is a Collective Layer service).&nbsp; All of the Services at the Resource Layer 
    must be able to perform <b>notifications</b> per the OGSI standard.</p>
    <p>While information received by the Index 
    Service is represented externally as Service Data in typical OGSI fashion, 
    the components at the <b>Collective</b> Layer represent Index Service 
    enhancements to the standard OGSI behavior.&nbsp; There is typically one Index 
    Service per Virtual Organization or resource site.&nbsp; When there is a large VO 
    that consists of multiple large sites, then often each site will run its own 
    Index Service that will index the various resources available at that site.&nbsp; 
    Then each of those Index Services would be included in the VO’s Index 
    Service.</p>
    <p>Service Data is cached as part of the 
    Aggregator mechanism.&nbsp; The <b>Provider</b> mechanism of the Index Service 
    allows you to generate Service Data using Java-based or other executable 
    information provider programs.</p>
    <p>Users can access Service Data from the 
    Aggregator or Provider mechanisms through subscriptions, <br>
    ogsi-find-service-data 
    queries, or both.</p>
<h2>Basic Differences Between MDS2 and the GT3 Index Service</h2>
<p>In GT2, MDS provides the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
<p>acquire information about resources and publish them to an 
information service using a standard interchange format (Lightweight Directory 
Interchange Format, or LDIF);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
<p>maintain information in soft-state fashion using TTL data 
provided with incoming information;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
<p>deliver information in response to client queries using a 
standard protocol (the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
<p>create a hierarchy of information indexes supporting client 
queries at all levels.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
<h3>
Data Format</h3>
<p>In MDS2, data is stored in an in-memory LDAP repository 
in native LDIF format.&nbsp; LDIF is also the format for data delivered to, and 
received from, MDS.</p>
<p>In GT3, data is received, stored, and delivered in XML 
format in any of several Service Data containers,&nbsp; including an XML database and an in-memory cache.</p>
<h3>
Data Structure</h3>
<p>A standalone Index Service, or a hierarchy of them, can 
aggregate data in the MDS2 sense.</p>
<p>Host information is represented by default 
in the GLUE schema, by default using a scripted provider mechanism similar to 
that in MDS2.</p>
<h3>
Data Sources</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, 
platform data  normally originates from GLUE providers.&nbsp; In addition, because 
of the nature of Service Data in the OGSA model embodied by GT3, an Index 
Service is able to hold the Service Data of any <b>Service Instance</b> to which it has 
access. This means that in GT3, the Index Service monitors not only 
computer platforms but the Services running within the Grid as well.</p>
<h3>
Query Mechanisms</h3>
<p>MDS2 restricts clients to 
using the LDAP query language, 
which forces the clients to download a lot of information and do subsequent 
client-side processing to find the desired data.</p>
<p>MDS3  supports both simple and complex queries.&nbsp;The OGSA framework allows you to implement your own application- or domain-specific 
query types, in addition to XPath and query-by-name capabilities.&nbsp; </p>
