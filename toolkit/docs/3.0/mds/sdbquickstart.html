<p>This document is intended to give you a quick introduction
to the  Service Data Browser, which is the graphical user interface to service
 data within the Globus Toolkit® Version
 3.0.&nbsp; 
        The Service Data Browser allows you to view the details of the Grid 
        services available to you from a Registry configured by your 
        administrator.&nbsp; Service data can be viewed in various formats, 
        depending on your requirements.
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>This document assumes that the
        Globus Toolkit 3.0 has been installed and 
        configured for your particular computing environment, and that the Service
        Data Browser has  been appropriately configured as well, as described
        in 
        <a href="sdbconfig.html">GT3 Service 
        Data Browser Configuration</a>. </p>
        <h2>About the Service 
        Data Browser</h2>
        <p>All Grid services expose service data.&nbsp; 
        The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) standard protocol and 
        standard service data interface used by the Browser make it easy to 
        display the service data and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) of 
        any Grid service.</p>
        <p>When the Browser 
        starts, and periodically through subscription/notification, it obtains
          a  list of existing services from the Registry.&nbsp; The Browser 
        allows the user to bind any frame to the service data of any known 
        service.</p>
        <h2>Starting the 
        Service Data Browser</h2>
        <p>To start the Service Data Browser, 
        enter the following command at the system prompt from within the bin 
        directory in your GT3 installation directory:</p>
        <p>
        globus-sdb</p>
        <p>This starts the Service Data Browser 
        and connects to the Registry specified in the Service Data Browser 
        configuration file (globus-sdb.conf, 
        described in 
        <a href="sdbconfig.html">GT3 Service Data Browser Configuration</a>).</p>
        <p>The Service Data Browser window then 
        opens as follows:&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The initial service list displayed 
        inside the Browser frame (and any ensuing frames you might open from
          New  Frame on the File menu) allows you to select any of the Grid services
           located in the configured Registry service.&nbsp; When you select
           a  service from a frame, you are connecting the frame to that service.&nbsp; 
        Once a frame is connected to a service instance, the name of the frame
         will change to reflect that service.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Using the Service 
        Data Browser</h2>
        <p>Once you open the Service Data Browser, 
        you can use it for the following functions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
        <p>
        Select a service from the 
        Registry.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p>
        Select and use an existing
        Visualizer to display service data in 
        various views.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The remainder of this document 
        describes and illustrates these functions in detail.</p>
        <h3>1.&nbsp; Select a 
        Service From the Registry</h3>
        <p>The “Select a service…” pull-down menu 
        in a Browser frame displays all of the Grid services available to you 
        from the configured Registry.&nbsp; For this example, we will be working 
        with an Index Service instance called “instance1,” which shows system 
        information.&nbsp; Scroll down in the “Select a service…” menu and 
        select “Index Service Instance – instance1,” as follows:</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>2.&nbsp; Select and 
        Use an Existing Visualizer</h3>
        <p>After you select “Index Service 
        Instance – instance1” in the Browser frame, click on OK and the 
        following window appears.&nbsp; You can select a 
        Visualizer from the pull-down menu.</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape
 id="_x0000_s1027" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="" style='width:432.6pt;height:291pt'>

</v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=721 height=485

        <p>A Visualizer 
        uses an open API that allows you to display service data in any desired 
        way, such as graphically as the data changes.&nbsp; The
        Visualizer determines the type, amount, and 
        format of the data displayed.&nbsp; The Known 
        Visualizers menu allows you to choose a defined
        Visualizer to view the service. </p>
        <p>The Service Data Browser provides four 
        default Visualizers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p>
        Raw Service Data</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p>
        Tree Service Data</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p>
        Raw WSDL</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p>
        Tree WSDL</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these 
        Visualizers are generic; that is, they will work for all 
        services.&nbsp; As described in
        <a href="sdbconfig.html"> GT3 Service Data Browser 
        Configuration</a>, you can create and add your own 
        Visualizers for specific service data.</p>
        <p>The default 
        Visualizers in the pull-down menu are described in the following 
        sections.</p>
        <h2>Raw Service Data 
        Visualizer</h2>
        <p>Select the Raw Service Data
        Visualizer from the Known
        Visualizers pull-down menu and click on OK.&nbsp; 
        A new tab appears in the service frame, which contains the Raw Service 
        Data as follows:</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape
 id="_x0000_s1028" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="" style='width:432.6pt;height:291pt'>
 <v:imagedata src="sdbquickstart_files/image007.png" o:title=""/>
</v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=721 height=485
src="image008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1028"><![endif]></p>
        <p>This raw data view provides all of the 
        XML details for the selected service instance.&nbsp; This data can be 
        used as desired for developing other Visualizers.</p>
        <p>To keep this view available and return 
        to the Known Visualizers menu, click on the 
        Known Visualizers tab.&nbsp; To close this 
        view and return to the Known Visualizers 
        menu, click on the “x” at the right of the Raw Service Data tab.</p>
        <h2>Tree Service Data 
        Visualizer</h2>
        <p>The Tree Service Data
        Visualizer displays the data in a 
        hierarchical representation that can be expanded or collapsed.&nbsp; 
        This Visualizer displays only the name on 
        the top level of the service data. </p>
        <p>Select the Tree Service Data
        Visualizer from the Known
        Visualizers pull-down menu and click on OK.&nbsp; 
        A new tab appears in the service frame, which contains the Tree Service 
        Data.&nbsp; The following is the tree data view of our “instance1” 
        example, with some of the items expanded:</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape
 id="_x0000_s1029" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="" style='width:432.6pt;height:291pt'>

src="image010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1029"><![endif]></p>
        <p>Note that the “instance1” service 
        instance for this example was created to use an information provider 
        program called “SystemInformation,” which 
        returns system configuration details.&nbsp; This information is visible 
        in the Tree Service Data view above.</p>
        <p>To keep this view available and return 
        to the Known Visualizers menu, click on the 
        Known Visualizers tab.&nbsp; To close this 
        view and return to the Known Visualizers 
        menu, click on the “x” at the right of the Tree Service Data tab.</p>
        <h2>Raw WSDL 
        Visualizer</h2>
        <p>The Raw WSDL 
        Visualizer displays the WSDL of the selected service instance – 
        definitions, bindings, port types, handles, and so forth.&nbsp; This 
        data can be used by other programs (like a GT3 component or any 
        user-developed software) to access the functions of this service 
        instance.</p>
        <p>Select the Raw WSDL
        Visualizer from the Known
        Visualizers pull-down menu and click on OK.&nbsp; 
        A new tab appears in the service frame, which contains the raw WSDL 
        data.&nbsp; The following is the raw WSDL view of our “instance1” 
        example:&nbsp;</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

        menu, click on the “x” at the right of the Raw WSDL tab.</p>
        <h2>Tree WSDL 
        Visualizer</h2>
        <p>The Tree WSDL 
        Visualizer displays a hierarchical representation of the raw WSDL 
        data.&nbsp; The view can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the 
        items in the tree.</p>
        <p>Select the Tree WSDL
        Visualizer from the Known
        Visualizers pull-down menu and click on OK.&nbsp; 
        A new tab appears in the service frame, which contains the tree WSDL 
        data.&nbsp; The following is the tree WSDL view of our “instance1” 
        example, with some of the items expanded:</p>
        <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

        menu, click on the “x” at the right of the Tree WSDL tab.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Adding a 
        Visualizer</h2>
        <p>You can add a 
        Visualizer to the Service Data Browser as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p>
        Either obtain an existing
        Visualizer and add it to the Browser, or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p>
        Create a new
        Visualizer for your specific service data 
        and the way in which you want it&nbsp; displayed, and
        then add it to the Browser.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding a 
        Visualizer is described in more detail in
        <a href="sdbconfig.html"> GT3 Service 
        Data Browser Configuration</a>.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Service Data 
        Browser Display Options</h2>
        <p>The Service Data Browser allows you to 
        vary the appearance and display order of your frames.</p>
        <p>To change appearance, select Set Look 
        And Feel from the Tools menu.&nbsp; This gives you three appearance 
        options: Windows, Metal, and Motif.&nbsp; Metal is the option used for 
        the examples in this document and is the default.</p>
        <p>To change the arrangement of the frames 
        on the screen, select one of the options on the Windows menu: Tile 
        Horizontally, Tile Vertically, or Cascade.</p>
