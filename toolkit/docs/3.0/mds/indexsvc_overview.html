        <h2><a name="ISandGT">The Index Service 
        and the Globus Toolkit</a></h2>
        <p>Let’s begin by putting the Index 
        Service in the perspective of computational Grids, the Globus Project<code>™</code>,
         and the Globus Toolkit.</p>
        <p>Computational Grids are environments 
        that enable software applications to integrate instruments, displays,
         computational resources, and information resources that are managed
        by  diverse organizations and widespread locations.&nbsp; Grid applications
        often  involve large amounts of data and/or computing and are not easily
         handled by today’s Internet and web infrastructures.</p>
        <p>Grid technologies enable large-scale 
        sharing of resources within groups of individuals and/or institutions.&nbsp; 
        In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and monitoring of 
        resources, services, and computations are challenging problems due to 
        the considerable diversity, large numbers, dynamic behavior, and 
        geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be 
        interested.&nbsp; Consequently, information services are a vital part of any 
        Grid software or infrastructure, providing fundamental mechanisms for 
        discovery and monitoring, and hence for planning and adapting 
        application behavior.</p>
        <p>The Globus Project is developing the 
        fundamental technologies needed to build these computational Grids.&nbsp; 
        Globus research focuses not only on the issues associated with building 
        computational Grid infrastructures, but also on the problems that arise 
        in designing and developing Grid-based applications.</p>
        <p>The Globus Project provides software 
        tools that make it easier to build computational Grids and Grid-based 
        applications.&nbsp; These tools are collectively called the Globus Toolkit.&nbsp; 
        The Toolkit is used by many organizations to build computational Grids 
        that can support their applications.</p>
        <p>The composition of the Globus Toolkit 
        can be pictured as the following three pillars.&nbsp; Security is the 
        foundation common to all three pillars.</p>

        <p>The first pillar of the Globus Toolkit 
        provides Resource Management, which involves the allocation of 
        Grid resources.&nbsp; It includes such packages as the Globus Resource 
        Allocation Manager (GRAM) and Globus Access to Secondary Storage (GASS).</p>
        <p>The second pillar of the Globus Toolkit 
        is for Information Services, which provide information about Grid 
        resources and are the focus of this document.&nbsp; Such services include the 
        GT3 Index Service.</p>
        <p>The third pillar of the Globus Toolkit 
        is for Data Management, which involves the ability to access and 
        manage data in a Grid environment.&nbsp; This involves such utilities as 
        GridFTP and the Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service, which are used to 
        move files between Grid-enabled devices.</p>
        <p>In the context of the Globus Toolkit, 
        Information Services have the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A basis for configuration and 
          adaptation in heterogeneous environments</li>
          <li> 
          Uniform, 
          flexible access to static and dynamic information</li>
          <li> 
          Scalable, efficient access to data</li>
          <li> 
          Access to multiple information sources</li>
          <li> 
          Decentralized maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of this information 
        infrastructure, the Index Service uses an extensible framework for 
        managing static and dynamic data for Grids built using the Globus 
        Toolkit 3.0.&nbsp; The functionality provided includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic service data creation and 
          management via Service Data Provider programs</li>
          <li> 
          Aggregation of service data from 
          multiple instances</li>
          <li> 
          Registration of Grid service instances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Globus Toolkit 3.0 is based on Open 
        Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) mechanisms.&nbsp; OGSA integrates Grid 
        computing and Web services technologies by using the Web Services 
        Description Language (WSDL) to achieve self-describing, discoverable 
        services and interoperable protocols, with extensions to support 
        multiple coordinated interfaces and change management.&nbsp; Within OGSA, 
        everything is represented as a Grid service: a Web service that 
        provides a set of well-defined interfaces and that follows specific 
        conventions.&nbsp; The interfaces address discovery, dynamic service 
        creation, lifetime management, notification, and manageability; the 
        conventions address naming and upgradeability.</p>
        <p>These Grid services are not only a 
        static set of persistent services; they can also be transient service
           instances such as a query against a database, a data mining operation,
          a  network bandwidth allocation, a running data transfer, and an advance
           reservation for processing capability.&nbsp; There may be one or more 
        instances of a particular Grid service.</p>
        <h2><a name="ISuses">Uses/Benefits of 
        the Index Service</a></h2>
        <p>Each Grid service instance has a set of 
        service data associated with it, and this data is represented in a 
        standardized way.&nbsp; There is also a standard operation for retrieving 
        this service data from individual Grid service instances, as well as 
        standard interfaces for registering information about Grid service 
        instances.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Discovery often requires 
        instance-specific, perhaps dynamic information.&nbsp; Service data offers a 
        general solution in that every service must support some common service 
        data, and may support any additional service data desired.</p>
        <p>The Index Service does not beget 
        specific data types.&nbsp; The types of data available from the Index Service 
        for queries instead depend on how the Service is configured; that is, 
        what sorts of Service Data Provider programs it uses to aggregate data.
        </p>
        <p>The Index Service provides the 
        following key capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An interface for connecting external 
          Service Data Provider programs to service instances</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Index Service provides a standard 
          mechanism for dynamic generation of service data via external 
          programs.&nbsp; These external provider programs can be the core providers 
          that are part of GT3 or user-created, custom providers. </p>
        </blockquote>

          <li>

          A generic framework for aggregation of 
          service data</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Service data coming in from various 
          Service Data Provider programs can be aggregated in different ways and 
          indexed to provide efficient query processing.&nbsp; The Index Service also 
          provides a standard mechanism for registration, polling, and 
          notification/subscription of service data.</p>
</blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <p>A 
            Registry of Grid services</li>
          </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A set of available Grid services is 
          maintained in a Registry.&nbsp; A Registry allows for soft-state 
          registration of Grid services, in that a set of services can be 
          registered and periodically updated as required.&nbsp; A Registry then can 
          be used to support query or other operations on a given service.<br>

        <h2>
        <a name="ISinfomodel">Index Service 
        Information Model</a></h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, each Grid service 
        instance has a particular set of service data associated with it.&nbsp; The 
        essence of the Index Service is to provide an interface for operations 
        accessing, aggregating, generating, and querying this data.</p>
        <p>This section presents a brief overview 
        of OGSA and Globus Toolkit 3.0 concepts and terminology as related to 
        the Index Service.&nbsp; More information on OGSA and GT3 can be found in the 
        publications listed in the 
        <a href="#RelatedDocuments">Related Documents</a> section.</p>
        <p>The OGSA model comprises persistent 
        services (typically a few) and transient services (potentially many).&nbsp; 
        All services adhere to specified Grid service interfaces and behaviors.&nbsp; 
        The interfaces correspond to WSDL portTypes and are used for managing 
        the Grid service instances.&nbsp; The GridService portType is used to 
        query and update the service data of a Grid Service instance and control 
        the lifetime of the instance.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The interfaces and functions most 
        relevant to the Index Service can be summarized as follows:</p>

        <p>To summarize, a Grid service instance 
        is created by the Factory interface, which returns a GSH to identify the 
        service.&nbsp; The GSH is converted to a GSR (which includes binding 
        information) so that the service can be used.&nbsp; Service instances can be 
        identified in a Registry, which can be used to support query or other 
        operations on a given service.&nbsp; The Notification interface provides for 
        subscription to and delivery of notification messages regarding 
        service-related events.<br>

        <p>Data discovery often requires 
        instance-specific, sometimes dynamic information.&nbsp; So far in this 
        document, we’ve seen that each Grid service instance has a particular 
        set of service data associated with it.&nbsp; This service data offers a 
        general solution to the issues of discovery, in that every service must 
        support some common service data, and may support any additional service 
        data desired, such as metadata and instance state data.</p>

        notification, etc.</p>
        <p>Both subscription and FindServiceData 
        are forms of query against the service data of an instance.&nbsp; 
        FindServiceData is a simple synchronous query (pull), while a 
        subscription notification is a persistent query, with asynchronous 
        response (push).</p>
        <p>The Registry interface supports 
        discovery by returning the GSHs of a set of Grid services.&nbsp; The
        Registry  allows for soft-state registration of Grid services, in that
        a set of  Grid services can periodically register their GSHs into a Registry
         service, to allow for discovery of services in that set.</p>

        <a name="UserInterface">User Interface</a></h2>
        <p>In GT3, there are presently two ways in 
        which you can access the service data aggregated by the Index Service:&nbsp; 
        the GT3 Service Data Browser and the 
        <code>
        ogsi-find-service-data</code>
command.</p>
        <h3>GT3 Service Data 
        Browser</h3>
        <p>The Service Data Browser is the GUI to 
        service data within GT3.&nbsp; The Browser allows you to view the details
        of  the Grid services available to you from a Registry configured by
        your  administrator.&nbsp; These services include, but are not limited
        to, the  Index Service.&nbsp; Service data can be viewed in various formats,
        depending  on your requirements.&nbsp; Refer to 
        <a href="sdbquickstart.html">GT3 Service Data Browser Quick 
        Start</a> for details on and examples of using the Browser.</p>
        <h3>ogsi-find-service-data 
        Command</h3>
        <p>The 
        
        ogsi-find-service-data command provides a 
        command-line interface for querying the service data available to you 
        from the Index Service or any Grid service.</p>
        <p>The 
        
        ogsi-find-service-data command allows you 
        to perform the following types of queries:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By specifying a Grid service and one 
          or more Service Data Element names.</li>
          <li> 
          By specifying an XPath expression in 
          addition to the above.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can specify the 
        
        ogsi-find-service-data command output as 
        raw XML or as an easy-to-read outline format. </p>
        <p>Refer to

        <h2>
        <a name="Security">Security</a></h2>
        <p>The security mechanism used by the 
        Globus Toolkit is the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), which enables 
        the use of certificates and various files to provide authentication and 
        authorization services.&nbsp; GSI is described in more detail in 
        <a href="../gsi/">
        GSI Security Infrastructure</a>. </p>
        <p>GSI is a library for providing generic 
        security services for applications that will be run on the Grid.&nbsp; GSI 
        provides programs to facilitate login to a variety of sites, while each 
        site has its own flavor of security measures. </p>
        <p>GSI provides a single sign-on 
        authentication service, to identify a user for access to multiple Grid 
        resources via one sign-on procedure.&nbsp; GSI also provides local control 
        over access rights and mapping from global to local user identities.</p>
        <p>OGSA provides two different GSI 
        implementations.&nbsp; One is based on message-level security, and the other 
        on transport-level security, as known from Version 2 of the Globus 
        Toolkit (GT2).&nbsp; Transport-level security is supported in order to be 
        backwards compatible with GT2, and also to simplify integration with 
        hosting environments without message-level security support.&nbsp; GSI 
        defines protocols for mutual authentication, credential delegation, 
        proxy signing, message protection, and authorization, and typically sits 
        on top of a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) 
        implementation.</p>
        <p>For more information on GT3/OGSA 
        security, refer to
