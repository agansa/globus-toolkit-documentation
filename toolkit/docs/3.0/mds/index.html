        <p>Note:&nbsp; This 
        page contains information and document links for MDS3, the latest 
        version of MDS.&nbsp; MDS2 information is now available at 
        <a href="../../2.4/mds/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/2.4/mds/</a>.</p>
        <p>The Information Services component 
        framework of the Globus Toolkit Version 3.0 (GT3) provides information 
        about Grid resources for use in resource discovery, selection, and 
        optimization.&nbsp; This information is critical to the operation of the Grid 
        and construction of applications.</p>
        <p>In the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) 
        on which GT3.0 is based, everything is represented as a Grid service.&nbsp; 
        These Grid services can be a static set of persistent services as well 
        as transient services.&nbsp; There may be one or more instances of a 
        particular Grid service.&nbsp; Each Grid service expresses its state in a 
        standardized way as Service Data Elements (SDEs).</p>
        <p>Information Services provides the 
        functionality within which Service Data can be collected, aggregated, 
        and queried; data feeds can be monitored; and Service Data can be 
        created dynamically on demand.</p>
        <p>The Information Services component is 
        therefore a broad framework that includes any part of GT3.0 that 
        generates, registers, indexes, aggregates, subscribes, monitors, 
        queries, or displays Service Data in some way.</p>
        <h2>
        The Monitoring and Discovery Service</h2>
        <p>The features provided 
        in GT2 by the Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS2) are now provided 
        by the GT3.0 Information Services component, which is now also known as 
        MDS3.&nbsp; 
        When used in conjunction with standard Open Grid Services 
        Infrastructure (OGSI)
        mechanisms that provide a 
        consistent way of querying any Grid service about its configuration and 
        status information, these services provide all of the capabilities of 
        MDS2 and more, all within a OGSA-compliant environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The GT3.0 Index Service provides an information 
        aggregation service that is more extensible than the GT2 GIIS.&nbsp; In GT3, the need for a separate GRIS goes away as OGSA-standard 
        Service Data Elements and Service Data interfaces enable any GT3.0 OGSA 
        service to act as its own GRIS.&nbsp; OGSI itself provides an important 
        addition to these services: a consistent mechanism for notifying 
        services of changes in Service Data Elements, allowing data to be pushed 
        or pulled into indexes.</p>
        <p>
        To simplify the development of Service Data 
        Providers, GT3.0 provides a pluggable information provider architecture 
        similar to the one used in GT2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard GT3.0 components such as GRAM 
        have been designed to provide Service Data Elements whose information is 
        similar to the existing GT2 MDS data.</p>
        <p>
        Note that GT2 MDS clients will not be able to 
        communicate with GT3.0 Index Services or use GT3.0 Service Data features
           without modification.&nbsp; GT3.0 Index Service data is available only
           in XML  form, whereas a GT2 GIIS expects LDIF.&nbsp; However, existing
           GT2  information providers can be ported into GT3.0 as described in
           the
        <a href="porting_guide.html">Porting
         Guide</a> linked below.</p>
        <h2>
        Information Services 
        Documentation</h2>
        <p>The documents linked 
        from this page describe GT3.0 Information Services overall, the Index
           Service and its related components, the creation and porting of service
           data providers, and tools for browsing and querying service data.&nbsp; These
            tools can be used with any Grid service.&nbsp; As 
        development of GT3.0 continues past this release, these documents 
        will expand to include more information and this page will link to 
        additional documents that will describe other aspects of GT3.0 Information
             Services.

        that documentation for MDS2 is available at
