    This guide will talk about how to install, configure, and initialize
    the Globus Replica Location Service (RLS) software.  It includes
    instructions for the RLS client API and server bundles, both source
    and binary.  The server bundles include the client bundles,
    you do not need to install a client bundle separately if installing
    a server bundle.  The following sections exist in this guide.

    <p>
    The RLS server depends on an ODBC interface to a Relation Database
    Server (RDBMS).   RLS was originally developed using MySQL and MyODBC (now
    called Connector/ODBC), however due to licensing restrictions with
    MyODBC RLS now uses PostgreSQL.  Either RDBMS may be used (or any
    RDBMS that supports ODBC).  The iODBC package is used to interface
    to the ODBC layer of whatever RDBMS you choose.  The ODBC driver
    for PostgreSQL is a separate package called psqlODBC.  If you use
    PostgreSQL you'll need both PostgreSQL and psqlODBC, if you use
    MySQL you'll need both MySQL and MyODBC (Connector/ODBC).

    packages:
    </p>

    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.iodbc.org">iODBC</a></li>
      <br><br>
      <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL ODBC Driver</a></li>
      <br><br>
      <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com">MyODBC</a></li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
    Any RDBMS that supports an ODBC interface should work, instructions
    for both PostgreSQL and MySQL are provided.
    </p>

    <p>
    The location of iODBC and the odbc.ini file must be specified
    before installing the RLS server.  Also if you're using MySQL its
    top level installation directory must be specified.
    By default these are assumed to be in $GLOBUS_LOCATION.  The following
    environment variables can be used to override the default locations.
    These should be set prior to installing the RLS server.  In addition if
    you're building from source and wish to build the client Java API
    (included in the server bundles) you need to set the path to the Java
    Development Toolkit (JDK) version 1.4 or later.
    </p>

    You can use the following commands to set these variables.  You only need
    to set these variables for RLS installation, they are not used when
    running RLS.  This document assumes you are using the <i>csh</i> shell or
    one of its variants, if you're using <i>sh</i> or something similar
    (eg <i>bash</i>) you should change the <b>setenv</b> commands to
    <b>export variable=value</b>.

    <h2><a name="dbsoftware">RLS Server Database Software</a></h2>
    
    <p>
    The RLS server was originally developed using MySQL and MyODBC.  However
    due to licensing restrictions with MyODBC it is now developed using
    PostgreSQL and psqlODBC.  You may use either set of packages.  In either
    case you need iODBC, which provides a generalized ODBC interface to the
    ODBC drivers provided with Postgres or MySQL.
    </p>

    <p>
    This document does not purport to be an installation guide for iODBC,
    PostgreSQL, psqlODBC,  MySQL or MyODBC.  Please check the relevant web
    sites for complete documentation.  The procedures followed by the RLS
    developers is briefly covered here.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="iodbcinstall">iODBC Installation</a></h3>

    <p>
    The following commands were used during RLS development to install iODBC
    version 3.0.5.  $IODBCSRC is the directory where you untarred the
    iODBC sources, and $ODBCINIDIR is the directory where you plan to install
    the <b>odbc.ini</b> file.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      cd $IODBCSRC
      </li>

      <li>
      ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_IODBC_PATH --disable-gtktest --with-pthreads --disable-gui --with-iodbc-inidir=$ODBCINIDIR
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake install
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You must now create the <i>odbc.ini</i> file, in $ODBCINIDIR.  The contents
    should include the path to where you intend to install the ODBC driver
    for your RDBMS (eg psqlodbc.so or libmyodbc3.so).  The following is
    an example that should work with psqlODBC, it assumes
    you will name your LRC and RLI databases "lrc1000"and "rli1000".
    Note you do not need an RLI database if you plan to use Bloom
    filters for LRC to RLI updates (Bloom filters are kept in memory),
    in this case you can omit the RLI entries below.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is apparently a bug in psqlODBC, it will not find a Data Source
    Name (DSN) in the system <i>odbc.ini</i> file <i>$ODBCINIDIR/odbc.ini</i>.
    It will find DSNs in the user's <i>odbc.ini</i> file if it exists
    <$HOME/.odbc.ini).   One work around is to copy or symlink the system
    <i>odbc.ini</i> file to each user's home directory.  psqlODBC does find
    system DSNs in a file called <i>odbcinst.ini</i>, which is looked for in
    the etc subdirectory where iODBC was installed
    <i>$GLOBUS_IODBC_PATH/etc/odbcinst.ini</i>.  So another
    option besides creating user <i>.odbc.ini</i> files is to copy or symlink
    the system odbc.ini file to <i>$GLOBUS_IODBC_PATH/etc/odbcinst.ini</i>.
    Someone who understands this better may have a better answer.

    <p>
    If you're using MySQL and changed how how MySQL clients connect to the
    MySQL server in <i>my.cnf</i> (eg the port number or socket name) then you
    should set option 65536 in <i>odbc.ini</i> for each database, this tells
    MyODBC to read the client section of <i>my.cnf</i> to find the changed
    connection parameters.
    </p>

    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h3><a name="postgresinstall">PostgreSQL Installation</a></h3>
    <p>
    The commands used to install Postgres 7.2.3 on the RLS development system
    were as follows.  $POSTGRESSRC is the directory where the PostgreSQL
    source was untarred.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      cd $POSTGRESSRC
      </li>

      <li>
      ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake install
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The following commands can be used to initialize PostgreSQL and start
    the server (the "-o -F" flags to postmaster disable fsync() calls after
    transactions which improves performance but risks DB corruption):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      initdb -D /path/to/postgres-datadir
      </li>

      <li>
      postmaster -D /path/to/postgres-datadir -i -o -F
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The following command will create the database user (called "dbuser") and
    password that RLS will use:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      createuser -P dbuser
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Please be sure to do periodic <b>vacuum</b> and <b>analyze</b> commands
    on all your Postgres databases.  The Postgres documentation recommends
    doing this daily from cron.  Failure to do this can seriously degrade
    performance, to the point where routine RLS operations (eg LRC to RLI
    softstate updates) timeout and fail.  Please see the Postgres documentation
    for further details.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="psqlodbcinstall">psqlODBC  Installation</a></h3>

    <p>
    The following commands were used to install psqlODBC 7.2.5.  Note
    the configure script that comes with psqlODBC supports a
    <i>--with-iodbc</i> option, however when the RLS developers used
    this it resulted in RLS servers with corrupt memory that would
    dump core while opening the database connection.  It seems to work
    fine (with iODBC) without this option.  $PSQLODBCSRC
    is the directory where you untarred the psqlODBC source:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      cd $PSQLODBCSRC
      </li>

      <li>
      setenv CPPFLAGS -I$(IODBC_INSTALLDIR)/include
      </li>

      <li>
      ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --enable-pthreads
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake install
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="mysqlinstall">MySQL Installation</a></h3>

    <p>
    The RLS server depends on transaction support in the RDBMS.  If you're
    using MySQL it supports transactions beginning in version 4.0.1 or later.
    The commands used to install MySQL 4.0.2-alpha on the RLS development
    system were as follows.  $MYSQLSRC is the directory where you untarred
    the MySQL source.  Note there may be a bug in the debugging code of
    MySQL, it should be configured with <b>--without-debug</b>.  There
    is definitely a bug in the MyODBC debugging code (see below).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      setenv CFLAGS -g
      </li>

      <li>
      setenv CXX gcc
      </li>

      <li>
      setenv CXXFLAGS "-g -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"
      </li>

      <li>
      cd $MYSQLSRC
      </li>

      <li>
      ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --localstatedir=$GLOBUS_MYSQL_PATH/var/db --without-berkeley-db --with-pthread --enable-assembler --enable-thread-safe-client --without-debug
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake install
      </li>

      <li>
      scripts/mysql_install_db
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    MySQL is configured via a file called <i>my.cnf</i>.  There are sample
    configuration files for configuring small, medium, large and huge
    databases provided with the MySQL distribution in the <i>support-files</i>
    directory.  Your <i>my.cnf</i> file should be installed in the directory
    specified by <b>localstatedir</b> when you configured MySQL.
    Some Linux systems come with MySQL already installed.  These typically
    have a global <i>my.cnf</i> file installed in <i>/etc/my.cnf</i>.  If you
    choose to install MySQL yourself you should remove or rename that file
    so that it doesn't conflict with your new <i>my.cnf</i> file, or you
    can start the MySQL server with the <b>--default-file</b> option
    set to the path to your <i>my.cnf</i>file.
    You should make the following changes for RLS:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      Uncomment all the innodb options.  RLS depends on the innodb
      table type since it's the only one that supports
      transactions.
      </li>

      <li>
      Set the <b>innodb_data_home_dir</b>, <b>innodb_log_group_home_dir</b>
      and <b>innodb_log_arch_dir</b> options to the directory(s) where you
      want the innodb data files to reside.  On the development systems
      these were set to the same value as <b>localstatedir</b> specified
      to <i>configure</i>.
      </li>

      <li>
      You may want to change the size of your database, by changing
      the sizes on the data files in the <b>innodb_data_file_path</b> option.
      A very rough rule of thumb for RLS is to set this to at least 1000
      times the maximum number of Logical File Names you expect to have in
      your database.  There may be more than one data file, the total
      size of all the files should be at least 1000 times the maximum number
      of LFNs.
      </li>

      <li>
      You may want to set the <b>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</b>
      option to 0, this can improve update performance dramatically, at the
      cost of small extra risk of a corrupt database should your host crash
      during an update.  For example on a Linux host the time to
      create 1,000,000 entries in an RLS database decreased from over 10 hours
      to 20 minutes by turning this option off.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Once you've installed and configured MySQL you must start the database
    server and create the database user/password that RLS will use to
    connect to the database.  To start the database server:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      mysqld_safe [--defaults-file <i>path to your my.cnf file</i>]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    To create the database user and password that RLS will use you must
    run the MySQL command line tool <b>mysql</b>, and specify the following
    commands.  These commands assume the username you will create for RLS is
    <b>dbuser</b> with password <b>dbpassword</b>, and the database(s) you
    will create for your LRC and/or RLI server are <b>lrc1000</b> and
    <b>rli1000</b>.  Creation of the LRC and/or RLI databases is covered
    below in the section <a href="#dbconfig">RLS Server Database Configuration</a>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <b>mysql></b> use mysql;
      <br>
      <b>mysql></b> grant all on lrc1000.* to dbuser@localhost identified by 'dbpassword';
      <br>
      <b>mysql></b> grant all on rli1000.* to dbuser@localhost identified by 'dbpassword';
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="myodbcinstall">MyODBC Installation</a></h3>
    <p>
    There is a bug in MyODBC version 3.51.05 and earlier.  The debug
    code is not thread safe, and the RLS server will get a segmentation
    violation and die if this code is enabled.  In versions 3.51.05 and
    later the debug code can be disabled with the configure option
    <b>--without-debug</b>, in earlier versions it is disabled by defining
    DBUG_OFF, eg:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      setenv CFLAGS -DDBUG_OFF
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The following commands are what the RLS developers used to install MyODBC
    version 3.51.03.  $MYODBCSRC is the directory where you untarred the
    MyODBC sources.  The following commands install MyODBC in
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION, you may choose a different directory if you wish, by
    changing the <i>--prefix</i> option to <i>configure</i> below.  It also
    assumes that iODBC was installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION, this may be changed
    by changing the <i>--with-iodbc-includes</i> and <i>--with-iodbc-libs</i>
    options.  $ODBCINIDIR is the directory where you created the
    <b>odbc.ini</b> file.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      cd $MYODBCSRC
      </li>

      <li>
      ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --with-mysql-libs=$GLOBUS_MYSQL_PATH/lib/mysql --with-mysql-includes=$GLOBUS_MYSQL_PATH/include/mysql --with-iodbc-includes=$GLOBUS_LOCATION/include --with-iodbc-libs=$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib --with-odbc-ini=$ODBCINIDIR
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake
      </li>

      <li>
      gmake install
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="serverinstall1">RLS Server Installation</a></h2>

    <p>
    To install the RLS server source bundle use the following commands:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      gpt-build globus-rls-server-1.1-src_bundle.tar.gz gcc32dbgpthr
    </li>
    <li>

    </ul>

    <p>
    To install the binary bundle do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      gpt-install globus-rls-server-1.1-i686-pc-linux-gnu-bin.tar.gz
    </li>
    <li>
      gpt-postinstall
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="dbconfig">RLS Server Database Configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
    RLS server configuration is specified in
    <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</b>, please see the man
    page <i>globus-rls-server(8)</i> for complete details.  Some of the
    configuration options (eg database user/password) are mentioned below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once the DBMS is installed and running, you should create a database user
    that the RLS server will use to connect to the DBMS.  The database user
    and password you pick must be specified in the RLS server configuration
    file, as well as the name of the database(s) you will create (see below).
    </p>

    <ul>
      db_user <i>dbuser</i>
      <br>
      db_pwd <i>dbpassword</i>
      <br>
      lrc_dbname <i>lrc1000</i> # optional (if LRC server)
      <br>
      rli_dbname <i>rli1000</i> # optional (if RLI server)
    </ul>

    <p>
    You will also need to create the database(s) that the RLS server will use.
    If the RLS server is a Local Replica Catalog (LRC) server you will need to
    create the LRC database.  If the server is a Replica Location Index (RLI)
    server, you may need to create a RLI database.  An RLI server can receive
    updates from LRC servers in one of two forms, as LFN lists (in which case
    the RLI database must be created), or highly compressed Bloom filters.
    Since Bloom filters are so small they are kept in memory and no database is
    required.  An RLS server can be configured as both an LRC and RLI
    server.
    </p>

    <p>
    The installation process installs the schema files for the LRC and RLI
    databases in <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus</b>.  There are separate
    files for PostgreSQL and MySQL:
    </p>

    <ul>
      globus-rls-lrc-postgres.sql

    You may need to edit these files to set the name of the database user
    you created for RLS, and the names of the databases configured in
    <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</b>.  By default the
    database user is <i>dbuser</i>, the LRC database name is <i>lrc1000</i>
    and the RLI database name is <i>rli1000</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once the schema files are as you want them, you can create the databases
    with the following commands (note once again that you do not need to
    create an RLI database if you are configuring an RLI server updated by
    Bloom filters):
    </p>

    <p>
    Use these commands for PostgreSQL:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>createdb -O <i>dbuser</i> -U <i>dbuser</i> -W <i>lrc1000</i></li>
      <li>createdb -O <i>dbuser</i> -U <i>dbuser</i> -W <i>rli1000</i></li>
      <li>psql -W -U <i>dbuser</i> -d <i>lrc1000</i> -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/globus-rls-lrc-postgres.sql</li>
      <li>psql -W -U <i>dbuser</i> -d <i>rli1000</i> -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/globus-rls-rli-postgres.sql</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Use these commands for MySQL:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>mysql -p -u <i>dbuser</i> < $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/globus-rls-lrc-mysql.sql</li>
      <li>mysql -p -u <i>dbuser</i> < $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/globus-rls-rli-mysql.sql</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="serverconfig">RLS Server Configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
    You should review the server configuration file
    <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</b> and change any options
    you want.  The server man page <i>globus-rls-server(8)</i> has complete
    details on all the options, a minimal configuration file for both
    an LRC and RLI server would be:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    # Configure the database connection info
    <br>
    db_user dbuser
    <br>
    db_pwd dbpassword
    <br>
    <br>
    # If the server is an LRC server 
    <br>
    lrc_server true
    <br>
    lrc_dbname lrc1000
    <br>
    <br>
    # If the server is an RLI server
    <br>
    rli_server true
    <br>
    rli_dbname rli1000	# Not needed if updated by Bloom filters
    <br>
    <br>
    # Configure who can make requests of the server
    <br>
    acl .*: all # RE matching grid-mapfile users or DNs from x509 certs
    </ul>

    <p>
    The server uses a host certificate to identify itself to clients.
    By default this certificate is located in the files
    <i>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</i> and
    <i>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</i>.  Host certificates have a
    distinguished name of the form <b>/CN=host/<i>FQDN</i></b>.  If the host
    you plan to run the RLS server is on does not have a host certificate you
    must obtain one from your Certificate Authority.  The RLS server must be
    run as the same user who owns the host certificate files (typically root).
    The location of the host certificate files may be specified in
    <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</i>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      rlscertfile path-to-cert-file # default /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
    <br>
      rlskeyfile path-to-key-file # default /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
    </ul>

    <p>
    It is possible to run the RLS server without authentication, by starting
    it with the <i>-N</i> option, and using URL's of the form
    <i>rlsn://server</i> to connect to it.  If authentication is enabled
    RLI servers must include <b>acl</b> configuration options that match
    the identities of LRC servers that update it, that grant the
    <b>rli_update</b> permission to the LRCs.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="serverstartup">RLS Server Startup</a></h2>

    <p>
    The script <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXrls</b> may be used to start or
    stop the server, eg
    </p>

    <ul>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXrls start
      <br>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXrls stop
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="mdsconfig">RLS Server MDS Configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
    The server package includes a program called <b>globus-rls-reporter</b>
    that will report information about an RLS server to MDS.  To enable MDS
    reporting please add the contents of the file
    <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/rls-ldif.conf</i> to the MDS configuration
    file <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-resource-ldif.conf</i>.  You will
    probably need to set your VO name in rls-ldif.conf, the default is
    <b>local</b>.  The VO name is referenced twice, on the lines beginning
    <b>dn:</b> and <b>args:</b>.  You must restart your MDS (GRIS) server
    after modifying <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-resoruce-ldif.conf</i>,
    you can use the following commands to do so:
    </p>

    <ul>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXgris stop
      <br>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXgris start
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="servertest">RLS Server Testing</a></h2>

    <p>
    To test that your RLS server installation is correct you may start
    the server in debug mode with the command:
    </p>

    <ul>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-rls-server -d [-N]
    </ul>

    <p>
    The <i>-N</i> option is helpful if you do not have a host certificate
    for the server host, or a user certificate for yourself, it disables
    authentication.  The programs <b>globus-rls-admin</b> and
    <b>globus-rls-cli</b> can be used to test functionality, please see their
    respective man pages for details on their use.  The simplest
    test is to ping the server:
    </p>

    <ul>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-rls-admin -p rls://serverhost
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you disabled authentication (by starting the server with the
    <i>-N</i> option), then use this command:
    </p>

    <ul>
      $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-rls-admin -p rlsn://serverhost
    </ul>

    <p>
      The RLS source bundle includes a test subdirectory (see the
      BUILD/globus_rls_server-<b>version</b>/test directory).  This includes
      a script called <b>runtests</b> that invokes a program called
      <b>globus-rls-test</b> to thoroughly test an RLS server.  You will
      need to edit the config file <i>test.conf</i> to set the name
      of the database user and password (and possibly the path to your
      odbc.ini file if you have a non-standard odbc.ini).  <b>runtests</b>
      will create databases called lrctest and rlitest, start up
      an RLS server, and run <b>globus-rls-test</b>.
      You may need to grant access to the test databases
      to the database user using <b>grant</b> commands similar to what
      you used to create your production database(s).  See
      <a href="#mysqlinstall">MySQL Installation</a>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="clientinstall">RLS Client Installation</a></h2>

    <p>
    The server bundles (source and binary) include the RLS client bundles,
    you do not need to install the RLS client bundle separately if you've
    installed an RLS server bundle.
    </p>

    <p>
    The RLS client bundles include a Java version of the RLS API (implemented
    as JNI wrappers to the C API).  If you're building from source and wish
    to build the Java API you will need to set the environment variable
    <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to the directory where the Java Development Toolkit
    (JDK) version 1.4 or later is installed on your system before building
    the RLS client.  The command to build the RLS client source bundle is:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      gpt-build globus-rls-client-1.1-src_bundle.tar.gz gcc32dbgpthr
    </li>
    <li>
      gpt-postinstall
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    To install the binary bundle do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      gpt-install globus-rls-client-1.1-i686-pc-linux-gnu-bin.tar.gz
    </li>
    <li>
      gpt-postinstall
    </li>
    </ul>
