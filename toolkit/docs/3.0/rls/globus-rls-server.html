<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The RLS server <b>globus-rls-server</b> supports both a Location Replica Catalog
  (LRC) server, which manages Logical FileName (LFN) to Physical FileName (PFN)
  mappings in a database, and a Replica Location Index (RLI) server, which manages
  mappings of LFNs to LRC servers. <b>globus-rls-server</b> may be configured
  as either an LRC or RLI server, or both. If it's configured as an LRC server
  the RLI servers that it sends updates to should be added to the database using
globus-rls- admin(8).</p>
<p>Clients wishing to locate 1 or more physical filenames associated with a logical
  filename should first contact an RLI server, which will return a list of LRCs
  that may know about the LFN. The LRC servers are then contacted in turn to
  find the physical filenames. Note that RLI information may be out of date,
  so clients should be prepared to get a negative response when contacting an
LRC (or no response at all if the LRC server is unavailable).</p>
<p><b>globus-rls-server</b> uses syslog(3) to log errors and other information
  (facility LOG_DAEMON) when it's running in normal (daemon) mode. If the -d
option (debug) is specified then log messages are written to stdout.</p>
<h2>LRC to RLI
Updates</h2>
<p>Two methods exist for LRC servers to inform RLI servers of their LFNs. By
  default the LFNs are sent from the LRC to the RLI. This can be time consuming
  if the number of LFNs is large, but does give the RLI an exact list of the
  LFNs known to the LRC, and it allows wildcard searching of the RLI. Alternatively
  Bloom filters may be sent, which are highly compressed summaries of the LFNs,
  however they do not allow wildcard searching, and they will generate more &quot;false
  positives&quot; when querying an RLI. Please see below for more on Bloom filters.
  The program <i>globus-rls-admin(8)</i> can be used to manage the list of RLIs
  that an LRC server updates, this includes partitioning LFNs amongst multiple
RLI servers.</p>
<p>A softstate algorithm is used in both update modes, periodically the LRC server
  sends its state (LFN information) to the RLI servers it updates. The RLI servers
  add these LFNs to their index, or update a timestamp if the LFNs were already
  known. RLI servers expire information about LFN,LRC mappings if they haven't
been updated for a period longer than the softstate update interval.</p>
<p>Options that can be configured to control the softstate algorithm when an
LRC updates an RLI by sending LFNs are include:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>rli_expire_int (seconds)</b></dt>
  <dd>How often an RLI server will check for stale entries in its database.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_expire_stale (seconds)</b></dt>
  <dd>How old an entry must be in an RLI database before it's considered stale.
    This value should be no smaller than <b>lrc_update_ll.</b> Note if the LRC
    server is responding this value is not used, instead the value of <b>lrc_update_ll</b> or <b>lrc_update_bf</b> is
  retrieved from the LRC server, multiplied by 1.2, and used as the value for <b>rli_expire_stale.</b></dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_ll (seconds)</b></dt>
  <dd>How often an LRC server does a LFN list softstate update.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_bf (seconds)</b></dt>
  <dd>How often an LRC server does a Bloom filter softstate update.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Updates to an LRC (new LFNs or deleted LFNs) normally don't propagate to RLI
  servers until the next softstate update (controlled by <b>lrc_update_ll</b> and <b>lrc_update_bf).</b> However
  by enabling &quot;immediate update&quot; mode an LRC will send updates to an
  RLI within <b>lrc_buffer_time</b> seconds. Immedate updates are enabled by
  setting <b>lrc_update_immediate</b> to true. If updates are done with LFN lists
  then only the LFNs that have been added or deleted to the LRC are sent, if
Bloom filters are used then the entire Bloom filter is sent.</p>
<p>When immediate updates are enabled the interval between softstate updates
  is multiplied by <b>lrc_update_factor</b> as long as no updates have failed
  (LRC and RLI are considered to be in sync). This can greatly reduce the number
  of softstate updates an LRC needs to send to an RLI. Incremental updates are
  buffered by the LRC server until either 200 udpates have accumulated (when
  LFN lists are used), or <b>lrc_buffer_time</b> seconds have passed since the
last update.</p>
<p>A Bloom filter is an array of bits. Each LFN is hashed multiple times and
  the corresponding bits in the Bloom filter are set. Querying an RLI to verify
  if an LFN exists is done by performing the same hashes, and checking if the
  bits in the filter are on. If not then the LFN is known not to exist, however
  if they're all on then all that's known is that the LFN probably exists. The
  size of the Bloom filter (as a multiple of the number of LFNs) and the number
  of hash functions, control the false positive rate. The default values of 10
  and 3 give a false positive rate of approximately 1%. The advantage of Bloom
  filters is their efficiency. For example, if the LRC has 1,000,000 LFNs in
  its database, of average length 20 bytes, then 20,000,000 bytes must be sent
  to an RLI during a softstate update (assuming no partitioning). The RLI server
  must perform 1,000,000 updates to its database to create new LFN,LRC mappings,
  or update timestamps on existing entries. With Bloom filters only 1,250,000
  bytes are sent (10 x 1,000,000 bits / 8), and there are no database operations
  on the RLI (Bloom filters are maintained entirely in memory). A comparison
  of the time to perform a 1,000,000 LFN update took 20 minutes sending all the
  LFNs, and less than 1 second using a Bloom filter. However as noted before
wild card searches of an RLI are not supported with Bloom filters.</p>
<p>The options that control Bloom filter updates are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>rli_bloomfilter true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>RLI servers must have this set to accept Bloom filter updates.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_bloomfilter_dir none|default|pathname</b></dt>
  <dd>Bloom filters saved in this directory and read at start time if not &quot;none&quot;.
    See CONFIGURATION for details.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_bloomfilter_numhash N</b></dt>
  <dd>Number of hash functions, an integer from 1 to 8. The default is 3.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_bloomfilter_ratio N</b></dt>
  <dd>Size of the Bloom filter as a multiple of the number of LFNs in the LRC database.
    Too small a value will generate too many false positives, too large wastes
  memory and network bandwidth.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_bf seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Interval between RLI updates when using Bloom filters. This can be much smaller
    than the interval between updates without using Bloom filters <b>(lrc_update_ll).</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note an LRC server can update some RLIs with Bloom filters, and others with
LFNs. However an RLI server can only be updated using one method.</p>

<h2>Signals</h2>
<p>The server will reread its configuration file if it receives a HUP signal.
  It will wait for all current requests to complete and shut down cleanly if
sent a INT, QUIT or TERM signal.
  </p>
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>If the configuration file is not specified on the command line (see the -c
  option) then it's looked for in <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf,</i> or <i>/usr/local/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</i> if
GLOBUS_LOCATION is not set.</p>
<p>Most command line options may also be set in the configuration file, however
  command line options always override items found in the configuration file.
  The configuration file is a sequence of lines consisting of a keyword, whitespace,
and a value. Comments begin with a # and end with a newline.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>acl user: permission [permission]</b></dt>
  <dd><i>user</i> is a regular expression matching distinguished names (or local
    usernames if a gridmap file is used) of users allowed to make calls to the
    server. Permission is one or more of <i>lrc_read, lrc_update, rli_read, rli_update,
    admin, stats,</i> and <i>all.</i> There may be multiple <i>acl</i> entries,
    the first match found is used to determine a user's privileges. The <i>admin</i> privilege
    is necessary to update an LRC's list of RLIs to send updates to. The <i>stats</i> privilege
  allows a client to read performance statistics.<br>
  <br>
  A gridmap file may also be used
    to map DNs to local usernames, which in turn are matched against the regular
    expressions in the <i>acl</i> list to determine
  the user's permissions.<br>
  <br>
  <i>acl</i> entries may be a combination of DNs and local
  usernames. If a DN is not found in the gridmap file then it is used to search
  the <i>acl</i> list.</dd>
  <dt><b>authentication true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable or disable GSI authentication. The default is true. If authentication
    is enabled clients should use the URL schema &quot;rls:&quot; to connect to
  the server, if disabled &quot;rlsn:&quot;.</dd>
  <dt><b>db_pwd password</b></dt>
  <dd>Password to use to connect to MYSQL server, default is <i>changethis.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>db_user databaseuser</b></dt>
  <dd>Username to use to connect to MYSQL server, default is <i>dbperson.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>idletimeout seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Seconds after which idle connections closed, default is <i>900.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>loglevel N</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets loglevel to N (default is 0). Higher levels mean more verbosity.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_bloomfilter_numhash N</b></dt>
  <dd>Number of hash functions to use in Bloom filters. The default is 3. Possible
    values are 1 to 8. This value, in conjunction with <b>lrc_bloomfilter_ratio,</b> will
    determine the number of false positives that may be expected when querying
    an RLI that is updated via Bloom filters. The default values of 3 and 10 give
  a false positive rate of approximately 1%.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_bloomfilter_ratio N</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets ratio of bloom filter size (in bits) to number of LFNs in the LRC catalog.
    Only meaningful if Bloom filters are used to update an RLI. The default is
  10.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_buffer_time N</b></dt>
  <dd>LRC to RLI updates are buffered until either the buffer is full or this much
    time has elapsed since the last update. Default is 30 seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_dbname</b></dt>
  <dd>Name of LRC database, default is <i>lrcdb.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_server true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>True if LRC server, default is <i>false.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_bf seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Interval between LRC to RLI updates when the RLI is updated by Bloom filters.
    The default is 300 seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_factor N</b></dt>
  <dd>If <i>lrc_update_immediate</i> mode is on, and the LRC server is in sync with
    an RLI server (an LRC and RLI are synced if there have been no failed updates
    since the last full softstate update), then the interval between RLI updates
  for this server ( <i>lrc_update_ll</i> ) is multipled by <i>lrc_update_factor.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_immediate true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>Turn LRC to RLI immediate mode updates on or off. Default is false.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_ll seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Seconds between lfn-list LRC -&gt; RLI updates, default is <i>86400</i> seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>lrc_update_retry seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Seconds to wait before an LRC server will retry to connect to an RLI server
    that it needs to update. Default is 300.</dd>
  <dt><b>maxbackoff seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Max seconds to wait before retrying listen in the event of an I/O error, default
    is <i>300.</i></dd>

  <dd>URL of server. Default is <i>rls://&lt;hostname&gt;:port</i></dd>
  <dt><b>odbcini filename</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets environment variable ODBCINI. If not specified, and ODBCINI is not already
    set, then defaults to <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/odbc.ini.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>pidfiledir directory</b></dt>
  <dd>Directory where pid file should be written, default is /var/run.</dd>
  <dt><b>port N</b></dt>
  <dd>Port server listens on, default is <i>39281.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>result_limit limit</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the maximum number of results returned by a query. If a query request
    includes a limit greater than this value an error (GLOBUS_RLS_BADARG) is returned.
    If the query request has no limit specified then at most <b>result_limit</b> records
  are returned by a query. A value of zero means no limit, this is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_bloomfilter true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>If true then only Bloom filter updates are accepted from LRCs, otherwise full
    LFN lists are accepted. Note if Bloom filters are enabled then the RLI does
  not support wildcarded queries.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_bloomfilter_dir none|default|pathname</b></dt>
  <dd>If an RLI is configured to accept bloom filters (rli_bloomfilter true) then
    bloom filters may be saved to this directory after updates. This directory
    is scanned when an RLI server starts up and is used to initialize Bloom filters
    for each LRC that updated the RLI. This option is useful when it is desired
    that the RLI recover its data immediately after a restart rather than wait
    for LRCs to send another update. If the LRCs are updating frequently this option
    is unnecessary, and may be wasteful in that each Bloom filter is written to
  disk after each update.<br>
  <br>
  If <i>rli_bloomfilter_dir</i> is set to the string &quot;none&quot; then
  Bloom filters are not saved to disk, this is the default. If &quot;default&quot; then
    the default directory is used, which is $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/rls-bloomfilters
    if GLOBUS_LOCATION is set, else /tmp/rls-bloomfilters. Any other string is
    used as the directory name unchanged. The Bloom filter files in this directory
    have the name of the URL of the LRC that sent the Bloom filter, with slashes
  (/) changed to percent signs (%), and &quot;.bf&quot; appended.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_dbname database</b></dt>
  <dd>Name of RLI database, default is <i>rlidb.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>rli_expire_int seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Interval between RLI expirations of stale entries. Default is <i>28800</i> seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_expire_stale seconds</b></dt>
  <dd>Interval after which entries in the RLI database are considered stale (presumably
    because they were deleted in the LRC). Default is <i>86400</i> seconds. Stale
  RLI entries are not returned in queries.</dd>
  <dt><b>rli_server true|false</b></dt>
  <dd>True if RLI server, default is <i>false.</i></dd>
  <dt><b>rlscertfile filename</b></dt>
  <dd>Name of X.509 certificate file identifying server, set by setting environment
    variable X509_USER_CERT.</dd>
  <dt><b>rlskeyfile</b></dt>
  <dd>Name of X.509 key file for server, set by setting environment variable X509_USER_KEY.</dd>
  <dt><b>startthreads N</b></dt>
