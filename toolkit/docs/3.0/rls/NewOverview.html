<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

    <p>The <i>replica location service (RLS)</i> maintains 
    and provides access to mapping information from logical names for
    data items to target names.  
</p>
    <p>  The RLS implementation is currently available as 
	part of the Globus Toolkit Version 3 release. The distributed RLS replaces the centralized Globus replica catalog available in
    earlier releases of GT2.x.  The distributed RLS provides 
    higher performance, reliability and scalability.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Replication of data items can reduce access latency, 
    improve data locality, and increase robustness, scalability and performance 
    for distributed applications. An RLS typically does not operate in 
    isolation, but functions as one component of a data grid architecture.&nbsp; 
    (Other components include services that provide reliable file transfers, 
    metadata management, reliable replication and workflow management.)</p>
    <p>Our RLS 
    implementation is based on the following mechanisms:&nbsp; </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>
            <i>Consistent local state maintained in 
      Local Replica Catalogs (LRCs).&nbsp; </i>Local catalogs maintain mappings 
      between arbitrary logical file names (LFNs) and the physical file names (PFNs) 
      associated with those LFNs on its storage system(s).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p>
      
      <i>Collective state with relaxed consistency 
      maintained in Replica Location Indices (RLIs).</i> Each RLI contains a set 
      of mappings from LFNs to LRCs.&nbsp; A variety of index structures can be 
      defined with different performance characteristics, simply by varying the 
      number of RLIs and amount of redundancy and partitioning among the RLIs<i>.<br>
&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li>
      <p>
      
      <i>Soft state maintenance of RLI state. </i>
      LRCs send information about their state to RLIs using soft state 
      protocols.&nbsp; State information in RLIs times out and must be periodically 
      refreshed by soft state updates.</li>
    <p>
      
      <i>Compression of state updates. </i> This optional compression uses
Bloom Filters to summarize the content of a Local Replica Catalog
before sending a soft state update to a Replica Location Index Node.  <br>
&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li>
<p>
      
      <i>Membership and partitioning information maintenance. </i>  The
current RLS implementation maintains static information about the LRCs
and RLIs participating in the distributed system.  As new
implementations of the RLS are developed, they will use OGSA
mechanisms for registration of services and for service lifetime
management.  
</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Relationship to Earlier Globus Replica Management Software</h2>

    <p> 
 
    The Replica Location Service replaces replica management tools available in earlier versions
    of the Globus Toolkit, incuding the Replica Catalog API and the
    Replica Management API.  &nbsp; The RLS differs from these earlier
    components in several important ways.  
    As a distributed system, the RLS is designed to provide greater 
    reliability by avoiding single points of failure as well as providing better 
    load balancing, performance and scalability. The RLS implementation is based 
    on open source relational database technology. Finally, the RLS strictly 
    separates replication information from other types of metadata; unlike the 
    original replica catalog, the RLS does not include information about logical 
    collections, but assumes such information is stored in a separate metadata 
    service.</p>
