<section id="gtadmin-makefile"><title>The makefile</title>
<para>
You do not have to build every subcomponent of this release.  The
makefile specifies subtargets for different functional subpieces.
</para>

<itemizedlist><title>Makefile targets</title>

<listitem><simpara>gram: GRAM5
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>gridftp: GridFTP
</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Note that all of these targets require the "install" target also.
So, for instance, to build GridFTP alone, you would run:

<screen>
$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
$ make gridftp install
</screen>

    <title>Linking with Globus Toolkit Libraries</title>
    <para>
        
        Since GT 2.0, the toolkit has included a script called globus-makefile-header that can be used to assemble the 
        cflags and link line information when linking a program with libraries included in the toolkit.  This script 
        would walk the package metadata dependency tree to ensure that all needed flags were included, without duplicates.
        This method worked, and continues to work in GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>, but we consider it to be obsolete, as we have added support 
        for using <ulink url=" http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config">pkg-config</ulink>
    </para>
    <para>
        
        Pkg-config is very similar in concept to globus-makefile-header, but it has gained widespread adoption across a range of unix platforms.
    </para>
    <para>
        To get the cflags and link line information to link to the globus-ftp-client library, for example, you could
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt><userinput>pkg-config --cflags --libs globus-ftp-client</userinput></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
        Each Globus Toolkit library has a pkg-config metadata file that is installed as part of its devel package. 
    </para>
    <para>
        For more information about pkg-config, please see <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config">the pkg-config homepage.</ulink>

<section><title>The Grid Packaging Toolkit</title>
<para>
The Globus Toolkit is packaged using the Grid Packaging Toolkit (GPT).
The GPT provides a way for us to version packages and express dependencies
between packages.  The Makefile for the installer is automatically
generated based on the GPT dependencies expressed in CVS.  GPT versions
also allow us to release update packages for small subsets of our code.
For more information on the GPT, you may see its
<ulink url="http://gridpackagingtools.com/book/latest-stable/index.html">
website</ulink>.

<section><title>Picking a flavor for a source installation</title>
<para>
If you're building on a platform that is not auto-detected by the configure
script, you will be prompted to specify a flavor for the <option>--with-flavor=</option> option.  Typically "gcc32dbg" will work as a flavor to build 32-bit
binaries using gcc.  If you want to force a 64bit build, "gcc64dbg" should work.</para>
<para>
Some platforms have better support from their native compilers, so you can use "vendorcc32dbg" to build using the native cc.  Similarly, "vendorcc64dbg" will force a 64bit build instead.
