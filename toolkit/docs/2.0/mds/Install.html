      <p>Installation
      and configuration of the MDS 2.1 release requires the following
      basic steps:</p>

      <p>1.&nbsp; Install MDS as directed by the Globus
      Toolkit 2.0 instructions<br>
      2.&nbsp; Obtain required certificate<br>
      3.&nbsp; Start MDS<br>
      4.&nbsp; Send a test query to GRIS and GIIS</p>
      <p>These steps are described in detail in the
      following paragraphs.</p>
      <p><b>1. Install MDS as directed by the Globus
      Toolkit 2.0 release instructions.</b></p>
      <p>MDS 2.1 is included with the Globus Toolkit
      2.0&nbsp; release. Therefore, MDS should be installed as described in the
      Globus Toolkit 2.0 installation instructions. Click <a href="../install/">here</a> 
      for information on how to get and install the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release.</p>
      <p><b>2. Obtain required certificate.</b></p>
      <p>MDS requires an X.509-compatible LDAP server
      certificate.</p>
      <p>The LDAP server certificate can be obtained by using
      the grid-cert-request command,
      as described in the <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>
      about MDS 2.1.
      This server certificate requires a certificate key. Only anonymous bind
      works without this certificate. You can install the certificate later,
      restart the service, and then test with authentication.</p>
      <p>The LDAP server certificate is located by MDS
      based on the GSI installation and configuration.</p>
      <p>The server certificate is set by default in
      GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/grid-info-slapd
      to GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/server.cert and server.key. This is where the
      CA signing policies and trusted CA certificates must be.</p>
      <p>Normal GSI functions determine this location,
      which involves the X509_CERT_DIR environment variable. Refer to the GSI
      documentation (<a href="../../../security/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security/</a>)
      for more information.</p>
      <p>Note that grid-info-slapd is a script called when
      MDS is started with the SXXgris start command, as described below.</p>
      <p><b>3. Start MDS.</b></p>
      <p>Start MDS 2.1 with the following command:</p>
      <p>{GLOBUS_LOCATION}./sbin/SXXgris start</p>
      <p>This command calls the grid-info-slapd script,
      which sets up the MDS environment variables such as those for the server
      certificate and key. This script then calls the slapd server, which reads
      the grid-info-slapd.conf file and determines all the other configuration
      files to read.&nbsp; Refer to
      <a href="../../2.2/mds/Config.html">MDS Configuration Files</a> for more details.</p>
      <p>The SXXgris start command does not require environment variables (GLOBUS_LOCATION).</p>
      <p>Note that there is no longer an SXXgiis start.
      There is a single slapd instance for both GRIS and GIIS.</p>
      <p>There is an issue with a cryptic SASL error
      message. If you get an error message that includes &quot;SASL local bind
      error&quot; (or something similar), confirm that GSI is functioning
      properly. Test GSI with non-MDS commands, confirm that GSI is properly
      configured, and retry. Consult the GSI documentation (<a href="../../../security/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security/</a>).</p>
      <p>The SXXgris start command is sensitive to the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>X509_CERT_DIR</li>
        <li>X509_USER_PROXY</li>
        <li>user proxy in /tmp</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The X509_CERT_DIR environment variable should
      point to the directory where the CA certificates and signing policy files
      are kept in your specific environment. (Typically this is put in
      /etc/grid-security/certificates.)</p>
      <p>X509_USER_PROXY usually should not be set unless
      you are an expert. There should be no user proxy in /tmp if you are
      running slapd (SXXgris, daemon). Refer to the GSI documentation (<a href="../../../security/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security/</a>)
      for more information on certificates and user proxy.</p>
      <p><b>4. Send a test query to GRIS and GIIS.</b></p>
      <p>Send a test query to GRIS on a local host, with
      the following command:</p>
      <p>{GLOBUS_LOCATION}./bin/grid-info-search -anonymous
      -L</p>
