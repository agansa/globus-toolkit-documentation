<p>There are several issues of note when starting/running the OpenLDAP
2.0 slapd server for the GRIS used by MDS.</p>

<p>These issues are the following:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>These issues are described in detail below.</p>

      <h2>Certificate and Proxy Locations</h2>

      <p>As described in
      <a href="Install.html">MDS 2.1 Installation and
      Configuration</a>,
      you start MDS with the following command:</p>

      <code>
      <p>{GLOBUS_LOCATION}./sbin/SXXgris start</p>
</code>
      <p>This command starts the OpenLDAP 2.0 slapd server
      for the GRIS. The command does not require environment variables (GLOBUS_LOCATION).</p>
      <p>The SXXgris start command is sensitive to the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>X509_CERT_DIR</li>
        <li>X509_USER_PROXY</li>
        <li>user proxy in /tmp</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The X509_CERT_DIR environment variable should
      point to the directory where the CA certificates and signing policy files
      are kept in your specific environment. (Typically this is put in
      /etc/grid-security/certificates.)</p>
      <p>X509_USER_PROXY usually should not be set unless
      you are an expert. There should be no user proxy in /tmp is you are
      running SLAPD (SXXgris, daemon). Refer to the GSI documentation (<a href="../../../security/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security/</a>)
      for more information on certificates and user proxy.</p>

     

      <h2>Port Assignments</h2>

      <p>Earlier versions of MDS required that a GRIS be
      configured for the IANA-approved port 2135, while each instance of a GIIS
      on that same server operate on a different port, leaving the system
      administrator with the task of selecting appropriate port(s) for the GIIS
      service(s). With MDS 2.1, MDS introduces a consolidated slapd
      instance for all GRIS and and GIIS services on a given machine, thus
      requiring only a single port, which should be 2135. It is highly
      recommended that port 2135 be used for all MDS services. However,
      alternate ports can be selected by editing all the 2135 occurrences in
      install/etc/*.conf.</p>

      <h2>SASL Dynamic Libraries</h2>

      <p>MDS 2.1 requires SASL, which requires dynamically loaded
      libraries at runtime. This dependency is an issue for environments that do
      not support dynamic libraries, such as the Unicos operating system.&nbsp;
      We have identified a feasible workaround, but it remains to be
      tested. Please contact the MDS group if you believe this will impact your
      environment.</p>

      <h2>SASL Error Message</h2>

      <p>There is an issue with a cryptic SASL error message.&nbsp;
      If you get an error message that includes “SASL local bind
      error” (or something similar), confirm that GSI is functioning properly.&nbsp;
      Test GSI with non-MDS commands, confirm that GSI is properly
      configured, and retry.&nbsp; Consult
      the GSI documentation (<a href="../../../security/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security/</a>).</p>
