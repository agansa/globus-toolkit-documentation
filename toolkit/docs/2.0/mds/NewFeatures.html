      <h2>High-performance GRIS And GIIS</h2>
      <p>The GIIS and GRIS services are
      implemented natively in the slapd server using plug-in modules. This
      allows in-RAM caching of data and low overhead processing of queries. This
      shortens GRIS query latency and reduces query overhead for cache hits.
      More significantly, it eliminates the need to fork additional processes to
      handle GIIS queries, resulting in a dramatic reduction in server resource
      consumption.</p>

      <h3><em>Memory-based Caching Backends for GRIS
      and GIIS</em></h3>
      <p>Performance concerns make caching data
      within the GIIS desirable, and this capability is provided as part of the
      basic GIIS framework. However, access control issues complicate caching.
      The GIIS can fetch and cache any data available to anonymous clients.
      Because the GIIS can also bind using a trusted server credential, each
      GRIS may export some data that it trusts the GIIS to handle properly. In
      the absence of delegation, GIIS is unable to transfer data from GRIS to
      client if the data is restricted by the GRIS to only be visible to that
      client. In future releases, we

      will be able to return the name of the information
      provider directly to the client in the form of a LDAP URL using the
      referral mechanisms defined as part of the standard LDAP protocol.</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of LDAP, a GIIS encourages
      the user to perform multiple queries. In essence, a GIIS takes a
      &quot;drill-down&quot; approach by implementing a number of queries
      that return small amounts of data with an increasingly focused scope.</p>
      <p>To support faster GIIS caching, MDS 2.1 now uses memory-based caching via a C program. Earlier functional prototype used
      file-based caching via a shell script, which was significantly slower.</p>
      <h3><i>Efficient GRIS Resource Information
      Providers</i></h3>
      <p>MDS 2.1 includes rewritten GRIS
      system probe utilities to further improve performance. The probes have been decomposed to separate low and high
      frequency data probes and eliminate many unnecessary probes. Additionally,
      the probes have been tuned in platform-specific ways to reduce overhead
      and latency. Core probes currently exist for Linux, Solaris, and Irix.</p>
      <h2><b>Revised Resource Representation
      Model</b></h2>
      <p>This includes new MDS schema files and
      new GRIS information providers.</p>
      <h3><i>New
      </i><i>MDS Schema Files</i></h3>
      <p>There are significant changes to the LDAP
      schemas provided by MDS 2.1. A mixed schema environment is not
      supported. That is, you cannot use schemas from previous releases with
      schemas from this release. Schema structure names are now different to
      prevent conflicts. Their names are derived from their object class. While
      the names are different, many of the attributes have similar meaning to
      prior versions. However, the new structured model provides a better
      representation for composite/hierarchical resources.</p>
      <p>Refer to
      <a href="Schema.html">MDS Schemas</a> for a complete listing of current MDS schema object
      classes, attribute types, and their definitions.</p>
      <p>The document RFC 2252 (<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt</a>)
      discusses LDAP attribute syntax in detail, and describes how users can
      create their own schemas.</p>
      <h3><i>New GRIS Information Providers</i></h3>
      <p>When the GRIS handling a resource status
      query suffers a cache miss, it dispatches an information provider to probe
      the necessary information. This means that the information providers may
      be on the critical path defining the query latency a client observes. To
      optimize this path, providers are specialized at install time for the
      specific platform on which MDS is being installed.</p>
      <p>Each external provider tool generates output representing MDS data objects.
      Output data is in LDIF format and must
      match the schema distributed with the providers. Details of the default
      MDS GRIS provider schema are documented separately in
      <a href="Schema.html">MDS Schemas</a>.</p>
      <p>The MDS release supports the
      information providers described in 
      <a href="DefaultGRISProviders.html">MDS Core 
      GRIS Providers</a>.</p>
      <p>You can also create your own information
      providers, as described in
      <a href="../../2.2/mds/creating_new_providers.pdf">MDS GRIS 
      Specification Document: Creating New Information Providers</a> (PDF).</p>
      <h2>Support For GSI Authentication
      And Access Control</h2>
      <p>In MDS 2.1, client and server can
      mutually authenticate using public key technology. Access can be
      restricted to trees of data or categories of information such as object
      classes and attribute types. A particular name or everything below it can
      be accessed to return information on a set of results such as CPU load.</p>
      <p>Authorization can be static,
      &quot;self,&quot; or dynamic.</p>
      <p>Static authorization is based on class,
      attribute, or object name rules.</p>
      <p>&quot;Self&quot; authorization is based
      on a semi-dynamic rule, and requires an &quot;owner&quot; attribute on
      objects. Authorization is also possible for a group, based on LDAP
      distinguished names.</p>
      <p>Dynamic authorization is based on
      per-object access rule attributes.&nbsp; That is, the object contains the
      access rule within itself. Dynamic authorization uses directory-based
      group lists. LDAP dynamic authorization is being worked on in the LDAP
      community. Refer to the <a href="http://www.LDAPzone.com">LDAPzone</a> for
      more information.</p>

      <h2>Integrated GRIS/GIIS Server</h2>
      <p>The GRIS and GIIS backends now share a
      common slapd server instance. Benefits include simplified install/admin,
      simplified configuration files, and a lighter load imposed by MDS. Note that both the GRIS and all GIIS(s)
      on a server will use the <a href="http://www.iana.org" target="other">IANA</a>-assigned
      GRIS port 2135 by default.</p>
      <h2>Change In OpenLDAP Version</h2>
      <p>MDS uses OpenLDAP as a standard transport
      protocol, which implements
      LDAP Version 3.&nbsp;The LDAP Version 3 protocol is more robust, higher
      performance, and provides more stable performance with threads.</p>
      <p>The OpenLDAP server defines an extensible server framework in
      which specialized backends can be plugged into a standard protocol
      interpreter. The interpreter handles all authentication, data formatting,
      query interpretation, results filtering, network connection management,
      and dispatch to the appropriate backend. This flexible design allows MDS
      to use the OpenLDAP server without modification.</p>
      <p>MDS 2.1 ships with OpenLDAP
      Version 2.0.14. See <a href="http://www.openldap.org">www.openldap.org</a>
      for the contents of this and prior OpenLDAP releases.</p>
      <h2>Support For The New Globus Toolkit 2.0
      Packaging Model</h2>
      <p>MDS 2.1 is installed as part of
      the Globus Toolkit 2.0. This
      permits incremental installation and deployment, so that MDS can be
      released at different frequencies than the other Globus components.&nbsp; Refer to the Toolkit
      <a href="../install.html">Installation
      Instructions</a> and <a href="../../../releasenotes/2.0/">Release Notes</a> for
      details.</p>
