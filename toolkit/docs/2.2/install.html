  <h2><a name="upgrade"></a>Upgrading Your Globus Toolkit Installation from 2.0 to 2.2</h2>

  <p>
If you have the 2.0 version of the Globus Toolkit installed, and would 
like to upgrade your installation to 2.2, please follow the <b>Upgrade:</b>
  items in the sections below.  They discuss the issues involved with
upgrading your installation.
</p>
<p>In general you should keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new directory to install the Globus Toolkit 2.2 
  in. <b>If you need to delete your current installation, be sure to back up any 
  configuration files, certificates and keys before doing so. </b></li>
  <li>If you have previously run setup-gsi as root, there is no 
  need to do so again, although it should not be harmful if you do.</li>
  <li>Any manual changes to configuration files in the 2.0 $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc 
  will need to be migrated to the new installation.</li>
  <li>Host and service certificates not located in 
  /etc/grid-security, such as the certificates used by MDS will have to be 
  copied to a new location. More on this in the <a href="#verify">Verification</a> 
  section.</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="overview"></a>Packaging Overview</h2>

<p>
The Globus Toolkit 2.2 uses the Grid Packaging Technology for
installation. You have two choices for installing the Globus
Toolkit.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Install from a binary distribution<b><br>
  </b><br>
   If you are obtaining the Globus Toolkit primarily to build a Grid,
   to develop Grid-enabled applications using our libraries, or to use
   our Grid tools, you may choose to obtain precompiled binaries. By
   doing this, you can save the storage space required by the code and
   you can skip the compilation phase of your installation.<br><br>
</li><li>Install from a source distribution<br>
  <b><br>
  </b>
   If you intend to make changes to the Globus Toolkit code or debug
   the Globus Toolkit code at the source level, or if you need to
   install the Globus Toolkit on a system for which precompiled
   binaries are not available, then you must obtain the source code,
   compile it yourself using our build tools, and install the resulting
   libraries and programs.
</li></ol>

<p>
The first step in either choice is to download and install the Grid
Packaging Technology.  Once that is installed and configured, you will
download and install the bundles of your choice: source or binary.   
</p>



<p>
To download the Globus Toolkit 2.2 software, please visit the <a href="../../downloads/2.2/">download page</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up Your Environment
</h2>

<p>Before you build and install the Globus Toolkit, you need to setup your
environment.  You will need to set the environment variable GLOBUS_LOCATION
to the directory in which you plan to install the Globus Toolkit.  You can
do this using the following example for your shell:
</p>


  <p>    {csh}   setenv GLOBUS_LOCATION  &lt;globus_install_dir&gt;<br>
      {bash}  export GLOBUS_LOCATION=&lt;globus_install_dir&gt;
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to replace
"&lt;globus_install_dir&gt;" with an actual directory.
</p>

<p>



<b>Upgrade:</b>  If you are upgrading from 
2.0 be sure not to overwrite your existing installation directory, choose a <i> new</i> 
installation directory to install version 2.2 of the Globus Toolkit. 


</p>

  <p>Next you will need to set GPT_LOCATION.  This environment
  variable will point to the packaging tools you need to install the Globus 
  Toolkit. We recommend that you install GPT in a different directory than the 
  Globus Toolkit. Examples:
</p>

  


  <p>    {csh}   setenv GPT_LOCATION  &lt;gpt_install_dir&gt;<br>
      {bash}  export GPT_LOCATION=&lt;gpt_install_dir&gt;
</p>

  


<p>
<b>Note:</b> Be sure to replace
"&lt;gpt_install_dir&gt;" with an actual directory.
</p>

<b>Upgrade:</b> If you are upgrading, we recommend that you upgrade to a new 
version of the GPT software. The Globus Toolkit 2.2 has not been tested with 
older versions of the GPT.<br>


<h2><a name="gpt"></a>Installing GPT
</h2>





<p>

The Globus Toolkit 2.2 uses the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/ACES/GPT/">Grid
Packaging Toolkit</a> (GPT) packaging software developed at NCSA.  GPT is a
multi-platform packaging system used to deploy Grid middleware.
This release of the Globus Toolkit may be built using 
either <a href="../../downloads/2.2/">
GPT v1</a> or <a href="../../downloads/2.2/">
GPT v2</a>. Both versions of GPT will build and install the toolkit equally well. 
The most compelling improvement in GPT 2 is that it makes upgrading individual 
packages easier. More improvements are expected as the GPT 2 series evolves. GPT 
1 does on the other hand provide a code base that has gotten more exposure and 
thus might be more stable. It should be noted that GPT 2 will eventually 
obsolete GPT 1.</p>


  



<p>
Before you build
and install GPT, you must have your environment setup correctly.  See the
section <a href="#setup">Setting up Your Environment</a> for help on how to do
this.  
</p>

  

<p>
Untar the
distribution and enter the following commands.<br>
<br>
   % gzip -dc gpt-*.tar.gz | tar xf -<br>
   % cd gpt-{2.2.2,1.3}<br>
   % ./build_gpt
</p>

  

<p>

<b>Note:</b> GPT requires perl 5.005 or later. 
If your perl 5.005 executable is not named "perl" or is not in
your command search path, add --with-perl={perl-cmd} to the
build_gpt command to identify the perl executable to be used by
the packaging tools.
</p>


<p>
<b>Note:</b> 
 GPT depends on GNU tar and GNU make.  We have found that 

  

on non-GNU 
(i.e. non-Linux) systems
it helps to have these tools available as gtar and gmake.
</p>


<p>

All of the perl libraries will be installed in $GPT_LOCATION/lib/perl. All
of the scripts will be installed into $GPT_LOCATION/sbin.
</p>



<h2>
  <a name="binary"></a>Binary Bundle Installation
</h2>

<p>

This section will show you how to install a binary bundle.  We will install the
toolkit using the linux binary bundle for the Intel i686 platform.   
</p>



  



<p>
To install the
binary bundle, run one of the following commands: 
</p>
<p>
GPT 2:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-install \ <br>
      globus-all-2.2.2-i686-pc-linux-gnu-bin.tar.gz 
</p>
<p>
GPT 1:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/globus-install \ <br>
      globus-all-2.2.2-i686-pc-linux-gnu-bin.tar.gz 
</p>



<p>
Before you can
finish your install, you need to source the following file.  To do so, first set your GLOBUS_LOCATION.  Then, depending on your
shell, run:<br>
   <br>
      {csh} source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh <br>
      {sh}  . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh<b><br>
<br>
</b>
Once the installation of the binary bundle is complete and you have sourced the
above file, run the following commands to complete your
installation:<br>
<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-postinstall
</p>



  <p>If you
  install any of the SDK bundles, you need to run the following command to get a
  header file which other header files in the SDK bundle depend on. 
  GPT 1 users can obtain the globus_core source package <a href="ftp://ftp.globus.org/pub/gt2/2.2/2.2-latest/packages/src/globus_core-99.tar.gz">here</a>. 
  GPT 2 comes with globus_core included, you just need to install
  it.  For &lt;flavor&gt;, specify the flavor of your binary installation. 
  The binary bundles contained on the download page use gcc32dbg as the build
  flavor for Linux, and vendorcc32dbg as the build flavor for Solaris.
</p>



<p>
GPT 2:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build &lt;flavor&gt; -nosrc 
</p>
  <p>
GPT 1:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/globus-build -install-only \ <br>
      globus_core-99.tar.gz &lt;flavor&gt;
</p>



<p>
Next you are ready to configure your installation.  Please see the
section, <a href="#verify">Configuring Your Installation</a>, below.
</p>



<h2>
  <a name="source"></a>Source Bundle Installation
</h2>



<p>

This section covers building and installing the Globus Toolkit from
the source distribution bundles. 
</p>



<p>

For each source bundle that you download, use the following procedure
to build and install the bundle.  If you are not familiar with the
individual bundles, please see the <a href="overview.html">Overview</a> page.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at the
<a href="platform.html">platform 
notes</a>.<br>
</li><li>Download a bundle file from the <a href="../../downloads/2.2/"> download</a>
  page.<br>

  

</li><li>Enter one of the following commands, substituting the bundle's filename and flavors as recommended in the table below.
<p>
GPT 2:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build &lt;bundle&gt; &lt;flavors&gt;
</p>
<p>
GPT 1:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/globus-build -install-only &lt;bundle&gt; &lt;flavors&gt;
</p>

<p>

<b>Note:</b>
You can instruct the build to keep logs of the install by including 
the following in the above command:<br>
  <br>
  GPT 2:<br>
      -logdir=&lt;log directory&gt;<br><br>
  GPT 1:<br>
      -log=&lt;log file&gt;
  
</p>
<p>

This chart shows what substitutions to make in the above command. Be sure to use the
actual name of the bundle (e.g., globus_data_management_bundle-client-src.tar.gz) in the
command.  
</p>

<b>Note:</b> You do not need to install the 
GSI bundle if you have installed or plan to install any of the other bundles. It 
is meant for applications which only depend on GSI.</p>



</li><li>You need to source the following

   <br>
      {csh} source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh <br>
      {sh}  . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh<b><br><br>

  <br>
  The next section talks about <a href="#verify">Configuring Your Installation</a>. </p>


<h2>
  <a name="configure"></a>Configuring Your Installation
</h2>

  <p>This
  section talks about how to configure the Globus Toolkit once you have it
  installed.  
</p>

  <p>

<b>Upgrade:</b> If you are upgrading your installation of the Globus Toolkit, it 
is not required that you 

 run 'setup-gsi' below.  However, you will need to migrate
any manual change you made to the configuration files in your old installation to your new $GLOBUS_LOCATION.  
</p>
<p>
The first thing we need to do is complete the setup of GSI, the
security software that Globus uses.  To complete the setup of the GSI software, you need to run the following
command as root to configure your /etc/grid-security directory:<br>
   <br>
      % $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-gsi
</p>

  <p>

<b>Note:</b>
 If you do not have root privileges on your machine, you can run setup-gsi with
its '-nonroot' option.  This will install the grid security directory to
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc.  The '-nonroot' option is intended to make client
side installations of the Globus Toolkit possible without root access.  It
is not intended to provide for a mechanism to run servers from a self contained
GLOBUS_LOCATION.
</p>



  

<p>

When it asks you if you wish to continue, hit return and then type
'q' followed by another return.
</p>

<p>

You may exit from your root shell to continue on.
</p>

  





  

<h2><a name="verify">Verification</a>
</h2>

<p>To verify the installation of the Globus Toolkit on your system, you can run some simple
tests.  The following procedure explains how to carry out testing of some
of the basic functionality of the Globus Toolkit.
</p>

<p><b>Step 1: Verifying  your installation</b></p>

<p>To verify that your installation is coherent, i.e. that all package 
dependencies have been satisfied, run the command:</p>

<p>GPT 2:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-verify
</p>
<p>GPT 1:<br>
   % $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt_verify</p>

<p>

  

<b>Upgrade:</b>  Users upgrading from 
2.0 to 2.2 who in the above chose not to run setup-gsi will receive the 
following harmless error:</p>



<p>The following setup packages still need to be configured via gpt-    
postinstall:<br>
globus_trusted_ca_42864e48_setup-noflavor-pgm<br>
<br>
ERROR: The collection of packages in /home/bacon/pkgs/globus-2.2 is not<br>
coherent!</p>

<p>

<b>Step 2: Obtaining certificates</b><br><br>
Security is at the heart of Globus, and as such, you will not be able to
test your Globus configuration until you have obtained a certificate for
yourself.  Additionally, if you plan on running your own gatekeeper, you
will have to request a certificate for your host as well.  The gatekeeper
must be run on a host which keeps a consistent name (i.e., you should
not run it on a computer using DHCP where a different name could be
assigned to your computer).
</p>

<p>
All of the following commands require you to set up your environment.
To do so, first set your GLOBUS_LOCATION.  Then, depending on your
shell, run:<br>
   <br>
      {csh} source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh <br>
      {sh}  . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
</p>

<p>

Now, to request a user certificate, simply run "grid-cert-request".
It will ask for a password to protect your key, and give you a set of
instructions for how to mail your request to the CA.  We recommend using
your regular mail agent to do this.  Address an email to ca@globus.org
and copy and paste the text from your ~/.globus/usercert_request.pem
into that email.  Please do not include the file as an attachment.  
</p>

<p>

The instructions from grid-cert-request will recommend using the
'mail' program.  We discourage this in these instructions because of
several things which could go wrong: You could send email from 'root'
or 'globus', which cannot be verified to your user account, you could
be sending mail from a machine which cannot receive a reply from the
CA, or you might simply be on a machine which cannot send mail in the
first place.  Using your regular email agent will avoid all of these
problems.
</p>

<p>

Within two business days, your user certificate will be mailed to you.
When it arrives, read the contents of the email and you may save the
entire email to ~/.globus/usercert.pem.  In the end, you will have a
userkey.pem and usercert.pem in your $HOME/.globus directory.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to run a gatekeeper on your machine, you will also
need a gatekeeper certificate for your host.  Run the following
command as root to get a gatekeeper certificate, replacing &lt;FQDN&gt; with the fully qualified hostname of your machine.<br>
   <br>
      % grid-cert-request -service host -host &lt;FQDN&gt;
</p>

<p>
<b>Upgrade:</b>  Users upgrading their installation of the Globus Toolkit 
from 2.0 to 2.2 <b>do not</b> need to replace their existing user certificates,
host certificates, <i>or</i> LDAP certificates.  Existing certificates are 
valid for the 2.2 releases.
</p>

<p>
Then, using your regular, user mail agent, send an email to ca@globus.org
and copy and paste the contents of /etc/grid-security/hostcert_request.pem into it.
Please do not include this file as an attachment.
</p>

<p>

Within two business days, your host certificate will be mailed to you.
When it arrives, read the contents of the email and you may save the
entire email to /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem.  You will need to be
root as this file should be owned by root with permissions 600.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use authenticated communcation with your LDAP server,
you can also request an LDAP certificate for your host at this time.
See the section about acquiring an <a href="http://www-fp.globus.org/gt2.2/admin/guide-verify.html#mds">LDAP
Certificate</a> in the <a href="http://www-fp.globus.org/gt2.2/admin/">Admin Guide</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
<b>Upgrade:</b> If you have a 
existing LDAP service certificate and key you will need to copy them to either 
/etc/grid-security/ldap/ldap{cert,key}.pem (preferred) or $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ldap/ldap{cert,key}.pem.</p>

<p>
<b>Step 3: Testing your installation</b><br><br>
When you have a user certificate, you can use the following tests to
verify a working installation.
</p>



  



  

<p>
First launch a gatekeeper by running the following (as yourself):<br>
   <br>
      % grid-proxy-init<br>
      % globus-personal-gatekeeper -start
</p>

<p>

This command will output a contact string like
"hostname:4589:/O=Grid/O=Globus/CN=Your Name".  Substitute that
contact string for "&lt;contact&gt;" in the following command:
$ globusrun -o -r "&lt;contact&gt;" '&amp;(executable=/bin/date)'
</p>

<p>
You should see the current date and time.  At this point you can stop
the personal gatekeeper and destroy your proxy with:<br>
   <br>
      % globus-personal-gatekeeper -killall<br>
      % grid-proxy-destroy
</p>

<p>

<b>Step 4: Debugging common errors</b><br><br>

<b>Q:</b>
When I run "grid-proxy-init", it says "grid-proxy-init: command not
found".  What should I do?

</p><p>

<b>A:</b>
First make sure you set your $GLOBUS_LOCATION, and read in either
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh or .csh.  If you have done
that, and still get this error, run 'ls $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin'  If
you do not see grid-proxy-init, your installation is incomplete.
</p>

<p>

<b>Q:</b>
When I run "grid-proxy-init", it says: "no certificate in file
File=/home/user/.globus/usercert.pem".  What's wrong?
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>
Your usercert.pem is empty.  You have to save the contents of the
email you received from ca@globus.org into this file.
</p>

<p>

<b>Q:</b>
When I run "globus-personal-gatekeeper -start", I get "ERROR: no
valid proxy, or lifetime too small (one hour)".  What's wrong?
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>
Make sure you run grid-proxy-init first.  If you ran the proxy-init
a long time ago, the proxy may be about to expire.  Run grid-proxy-init
again.
</p>

<p>

<b>Q:</b>
When I run "globusrun -o -r host.test.edu '&amp;(executable=/bin/date)'", I 
get "GRAM Job submission failed because an authentication operation 
failed (error code 7)".  What's wrong?
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>
Check your /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile file.  It may be malformed 
or not exist (error code 10).  The contents of this file are discussed
above.
</p>

<h2>
  <a name="more"></a>What can I do now?
</h2>

<p>
While running globus-personal-gatekeeper as a user is a good test, you
will want to configure your machine to run the globus-gatekeeper as root,
so that other people will be able to use your gatekeeper.  If you just
run the personal gatekeeper, you won't have authority to su to other
user accounts.  To setup a full gatekeeper, please see the section <a href="admin/guide-startup.html#gram">Starting
GRAM</a> in the <a href="admin/">Admin Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="admin/">Admin
Guide</a> also details setting up <a href="guide-startup.html#mds">MDS</a>
and a <a href="guide-startup.html#gridftp">GridFTP</a> server.
