      <h2>Creating Custom GRIS Providers</h2>

      <p>
		You can create your own information providers by following the procedures
      described in:  <i><a href="../../2.2/mds/creating_new_providers.pdf">MDS 2.2 GRIS Specification Document:
      Creating New Information Providers</a></i> (PDF).</p>

      <h2>Creating Platform-specific Core GRIS Providers</h2>
      <p>There could be a mechanism-specific variant for each</p>
      <ul>
        <li> grid-info-cpu-&lt;method&gt;</li>
        <li> grid-info-mem-&lt;method></li>
        <li> grid-info-net-&lt;method></li>
        <li> grid-info-fs-&lt;method></li>
      </ul>
      <p>        For a totally esoteric platform which doesn't even have uptime and uname
      functionality, we might have to introduce variants</p>
      <ul>
        <li> grid-info-platform-&lt;method></li>
        <li> grid-info-cpufast-&lt;method></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&lt;method> should uniquely refer to <i>how</i> the information is acquired.
      In all the existing cases, we have methods
      named either after a common mechanism or the platform for which they've
been completely tailored:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> linux</li>
        <li> irix</li>
        <li> solaris</li>
        <li> uname</li>
        <li> posix</li>
        <li> netstat</li>
        <li> uptime</li>
        <li> aix</li>
        <li> tru64</li>
      </ul>
      <p>        The *-common scripts contain the generic code that is used by all platforms.
      They would NEVER be modified for a new platform. They correspond to the
      structure of the schema. Each mechanism-variant probe script basically
      does some mechanism-specific activity which initializes a shell variable
      environment in which the generic code can be executed to output the actual
      LDAP objects. The common code defines the particular variables that may
      be set by a probe to pass information for the standardized LDAP values.
      For example, the cpu common script looks for these variables:</p>
      <pre>### variables used to store probed data
# _cpu_N_vendor=name
# _cpu_N_model=name
# _cpu_N_version=name
# _cpu_N_features=name
# _cpu_N_speed_mhertz=number
# _cpu_N_l2cache_kbytes=number
# _cpu_free1X100=number
# _cpu_free5X100=number
# _cpu_free15X100=number
# _cpu_count=0</pre>
      <p>        When a probe detects CPUs, it sets the _cpu_count value to the number,
      e.g. "2" on crater.
      Then it sets the cpu_N_* values for each CPU individually, e.g. on crater:&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>_cpu_0_speed=1700
_cpu_1_speed=1700</pre>
      <p>        This allows the individual probed devices to have distinct probed properties.</p>
      <p>        This is not well documented so anyone trying to work on these should
        definitely correspond over an appropriate MDS developers mailing list. </p>
