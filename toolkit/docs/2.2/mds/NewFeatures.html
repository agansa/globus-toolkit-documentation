    <h2>Expanded Debugging Capabilities</h2>
    <p>MDS 2.2 provides capabilities for checking servers registered to a GIIS, 
    writing OpenLDAP and GIIS/GRIS back end messages to a log file, viewing the 
    MDS system configuration via an expanded grid-info-mds-core information 
    provider, and displaying GridFTP performance information.</p>
    <h3>GIIS Registration Status Checking</h3>
    <p>GIIS registration status can now be checked with a new option on the 
    grid-info-search command, giisregistrationstatus.</p>
    <p>The status of servers that are registered to a GIIS or from which a GIIS 
    is getting data can be checked by this command option.&nbsp; If several servers 
    are registered to a GIIS and it appears that not all of them are sending 
    data, grid-info-search with the giisregistrationstatus option can be used to 
    check the status of those servers.</p>
    <p>For example, the following command:</p>
    <pre>grid-info-search -x -b &quot;mds-vo-name=site,o=grid&quot; -s base giisregistrationstatus</pre>
    <p>displays the status of&nbsp; the default server (as defined in the grid-info.conf 
    file) and a server registered to it.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The command output displays registration objects that include the status 
    type: valid, invalid, or purged.&nbsp; These status types are derived from the 
    validfrom:, validto:, and keepto: parameters, which are generated from the 
    ttl: parameter in the grid-info-resource-register.conf file.</p>
    <p>The validfrom:, validto:, and keepto: parameters represent the timeframe 
    during which one server keeps registration messages sent from another 
    server.&nbsp; This timeframe can be illustrated as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; validfrom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;validto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;keepto:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    ¯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;
    </span>¯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>¯<br>
    time=| &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VALID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    INVALID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PURGED&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
    <p>GIIS registration status checking is described in more detail in 
      <a href="hierarchical_GIIS.pdf">
    MDS 2.2: Creating a Hierarchical GIIS</a> 
    and in the 
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf"> MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a>.</p>
    <h3>Improved Diagnostics and Logging</h3>
    <p>MDS 2.2 uses the Unix syslog daemon, configured in /etc/syslog.conf, to 
    log OpenLDAP messages and GIIS/GRIS back end messages.</p>
    <p>You put an entry like:</p>
    <pre>      local4.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local-log-file</pre>
    <p>      in the /etc/syslog.conf file.&nbsp; Once you’ve done this, you’ll need to restart 
    your syslog daemon, which is operating system dependent.</p>
    <p>The syslog restart command publishes messages into the log file name 
    indicated by the local4.* entry in the syslog.conf file. </p>
    <p>The logged messages show slapd server messages for items such as machine 
    registration status, success or failure of a search, and slapd operational 
    status.</p>
    <p>Refer to the 
      <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf"> MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a> (the Diagnostics and Logging section of 
    Chapter 3, Using MDS) for more information on the use of syslog.conf 
    and examples of log file output.</p>
    <h3>MDS System Configuration Information Provider</h3>
    <p>There is a new MDS system configuration provider, grid-info-mds-core.&nbsp; 
    The system configuration provider generates deployment information such as 
    the service path, process ID of the current slapd instance, e-mail address 
    of the administrator, any administrative comments, and LDAP suffixes used by 
    the service.&nbsp; This type of information is helpful for MDS installation 
    debugging.</p>
    <p>The MDS system information provider output can be retrieved by using 
    grid-info-search to query all objects on a host.</p>
    <p>The system information provider uses the administrator’s e-mail address 
    from the grid-info.conf file and the administrative comments from the 
    grid-info-deployment-comments.conf file.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Refer to the 
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">
    MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a> (the Diagnostics and Logging section of 
    Chapter 3, Using MDS) for an example of MDS system configuration file 
    output.&nbsp; See 
    <a href="Config.html">
    MDS 2.2 Configuration Files</a> for more details on and examples of 
    grid-info.conf and grid-info-deployment-comments.conf.</p>
    <h3>GridFTP Logfile Information Provider</h3>
    <p>The GridFTP logfile information provider (gridftp-perf-info) takes 
    performance information from GridFTP and publishes it into MDS.</p>
    <p>For MDS 2.2, there is an entry in the grid-info-resource-ldif.conf file 
    for the GridFTP logfile provider, which can generate GridFTP performance 
    information on a daily basis.&nbsp; This entry is disabled by default, as all of 
    its lines are comments.</p>
    <p>To use the GridFTP logfile provider, edit its grid-info-resource-ldif.conf 
    entry to remove the comment hash marks.&nbsp; Then edit the gridftp-resource.conf 
    file (in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc) to configure it to your GridFTP environment 
    and information reporting requirements, in terms of host name, URL, and 
    logfile location.&nbsp; You can then use the grid-info-search command to retrieve 
    your GridFTP performance information.</p>
    <p>Refer to 
    <a href="Config.html">
    MDS 2.2 Configuration Files</a> for more details on and examples of 
    grid-info-resource-ldif.conf and gridftp-resource.conf.&nbsp; See
    <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/data/gridftp/">
    www.globus.org/toolkit/data/gridftp/</a> for more information on GridFTP.</p>
    <h2>Mutual Authentication in a GIIS Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>MDS 2.2 provides mutual authentication between 
    GIIS and GRIS servers as well as between GIIS servers in a hierarchy.&nbsp; This 
    feature is intended to keep rogue servers from affecting a GIIS hierarchy.&nbsp; 
    Mutual authentication is performed on outbound channels, as in a server 
    registering to the one above it in a hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Mutual authentication is enabled via a new parameter, bindmethod, in the 
    grid-info-resource-register.conf file.&nbsp; This parameter specifies the binding 
    method from the upper-level GIIS as one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AUTHC-ONLY:&nbsp; Bind only with GSI authentication.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> AUTHC-FIRST:&nbsp; Try authentication first; if that doesn’t work, use anonymous 
      binding.&nbsp; Authentication is tried first with every registration attempt.</li>
      <li> ANONYM-ONLY:&nbsp; Use anonymous binding only.&nbsp; This is the default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the bindmethod parameter is required in the 
    grid-info-resource-register.conf file.&nbsp; Without this parameter in the
    file, registration will not work.</p>
    <p>Mutual authentication works only for servers in an MDS 2.2 environment.&nbsp; 
    That is, there cannot be mutual authentication between MDS 2.1 and 2.2 
    resources.</p>
    <p>A related policy statement may be included in the grid-info-site-policy.conf 
    file to restrict mutual authentication to a particular host or hosts and to 
    a specific port on a host or hosts.&nbsp; In addition to the host/port 
    information, the policy statement in this file would appear as: </p>
    <p>policydata: (Mds-Bind-Method-servers=bindmethod)</p>
    <p>where bindmethod is one of the three binding methods above.&nbsp; The 
    binding method in grid-info-site-policy.conf should match that in 
    grid-info-resource-register.conf.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A new file, grid-info-server-env.conf, sets up the X509* and other 
    environment variables for use in mutual authentication.</p>
    <p>Refer to 
    <a href="Config.html">
    MDS 2.2 Configuration Files</a> for description and examples of these 
    configuration files.&nbsp; Refer to 
    <a href="hierarchical_GIIS.pdf">
    MDS 2.2: Creating a Hierarchical GIIS</a> 
    for additional details related to mutual authentication and the use of 
    policy statements.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><a name="openldapversion"></a>Change in OpenLDAP Version</h2>
    <p>MDS 2.2 ships with OpenLDAP Version 2.0.22, an 
    upgraded release.</p>
    <p>See
    <a href="http://www.openldap.org">
    www.openldap.org</a> for the details of OpenLDAP 2.0.22 and other OpenLDAP 
    releases.</p>
    <h2><b>New Core Information Providers</b></h2>
    <p>In addition to the MDS system configuration and GridFTP logfile 
    information providers described above, MDS 2.2 includes new core GRIS 
    information providers for the Tru64 and AIX operating systems.</p>
    <p>Each external provider tool generates output representing MDS data 
    objects. Output data is in LDIF format and must match the schema distributed 
    with the providers. Details of the default MDS GRIS provider schema are 
    documented separately in 
    <a href="Schema.html">
    MDS 2.2 Schemas</a>.</p>
    <p>All core providers are described in detail in 
    <a href="DefaultGRISProviders.html">
    MDS 2.2 Core GRIS Providers</a>.</p>
    <h2><b>New Start and Stop Commands</b></h2>
    <p>For MDS 2.2, the SXXgris start and SXXgris stop commands have been 
    renamed to globus-mds start and globus-mds stop, respectively.&nbsp; However, for 
    backward compatibility, SXXgris start and SXXgris stop will continue to work 
    in MDS 2.2.</p>
    <p>This name change reflects current Globus Toolkit standards.&nbsp; The 
    globus-mds commands are called via a symbolic link to the existing SXXgris 
    commands.</p>
    <h2><b>New Location for LDAP Server Certificate and Key</b></h2>
    <p>To create a standard way of naming directories for multiple services in 
    the Globus Toolkit (“ldap” certificates for MDS, “cvs” certificates for 
    gridcvs, etc.), the default locations of the LDAP server certificate and key 
    files are changed for MDS 2.2.</p>
    <p>A new configuration file, grid-info-server-env.conf, now sets all of the 
    environment variables for the MDS installation, replacing what was formerly 
    done by the grid-info-slapd script.</p>
    <p>The server certificate and key are set by default in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-server-env.conf 
    to $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem and ldapkey.pem.&nbsp; If 
    MDS cannot read these files for some reason, it will try instead $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ldap/ldapcert.pem 
    and ldapkey.pem.&nbsp; (You’ll need to put the files in that directory if it is 
    to be used.)</p>
    <p>When you start MDS with the globus-mds start command, the command calls 
    the grid-info-slapd script, which calls grid-info-server-env.conf to set up 
    the MDS environment variables such as those for the server certificate and 
    key. This grid-info-slapd script then calls the slapd server, which reads 
    the grid-info-slapd.conf file and determines all the other configuration 
    files to read.&nbsp; Refer to 
    <a href="Config.html">
    MDS 2.2 Configuration Files</a> for more details.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><b>New Command Syntax to Request LDAP Server Certificate</b></h2>
    <p>For MDS 2.2, the grid-cert-request command has new syntax for obtaining 
    the LDAP server certificate required by MDS, as follows:</p>
    <p>grid-cert-request -service ldap -host [my.host.fqdn]</p>
    <p>where my.host.fqdn is the fully qualified domain name of the host that 
    will run the LDAP server.&nbsp; As mentioned above, the server certificate and 
    key are placed by default (assuming you are running as root) in 
    GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-security/ldap.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Refer to the 
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">
    MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a> (the MDS Security Setup Procedures 
    section of Chapter 5, MDS Security Configuration) for more details on 
    the use of grid-cert-request and an example of command output for obtaining 
    an LDAP server certificate.</p>
    <h2><b>Adjusted Default Timings for GRIS Providers</b></h2>
    <p>For MDS 2.2, default values for timing parameters in the 
    grid-info-resource-ldif.conf configuration file have been adjusted to 
    maximize caching capabilities for effective return of the data requested by 
    the grid-info-search command.</p>
    <p>Each information provider specified in the grid-info-resource-ldif.conf 
    has three timing parameters associated with it:&nbsp; -validto-secs, -keepto-secs, 
    and cachetime.&nbsp; These providers and their new default timing parameter 
    values (all in seconds) are as follows:</p>
    <p>Provider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-validto-secs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -keepto-secs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cachetime</p>
