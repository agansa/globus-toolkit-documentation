      <p>OID's must be unique for all objectclass
      and attributetype definitions throughout a directory namespace.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Although we highly recommend that
      organizations obtain their own Private Enterprise Numbers directly from <a href="http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl" target="_blank">IANA</a>,
      the Globus team will <a href="mailto:mds-oid-registrar@globus.org">upon
      request</a> assign a subspace of the MDS OID to anyone publishing data
      into MDS.</p>

      So, your assigned OID will look like this:</p>
      <pre>1.3.6.1.4.1.3536.2.6.3536.n</pre>
      <p>Where &quot;n&quot; is
      your specific assigned number. You have the ability to subdivide an
      assigned OID as you choose.</p>
      <p>Please note that just
      like OID's, objectclass names and attributetype names must also be unique
      across the entire directory name space. MDS addresses this issue by
      prefixing all names with &quot;Mds&quot;.</p>
      <p>We recommend that if you
      are obtaining an OID to add items to the directory service schema, that
      you also select a prefix to use on all objectclass and attributetype
      names. Sending this prefix to the mds-oid-registrar as part of your OID
      request will help ensure uniqueness of names for items added to the
      information services name space.</p>
