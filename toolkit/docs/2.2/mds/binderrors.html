    <p>This page 
    describes what to check and what actions to take to resolve problems in your 
    MDS environment that can generate the following error messages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#ldap_bind_cantcontactserver">ldap_bind: Can’t contact LDAP server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nosuchobject">No such object</a></li>
      <li>
      <a href="#ldapsasl_bind_cantcontactserver">ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: 
      Can’t contact LDAP server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ldapsasl_bind_localerror">ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: local error</a></li>
      <li>
      <a href="#ldapsasl_bind_unknownerror_certaccess">ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Unknown error – unable to access certificates</a></li>
      <li>
      <a href="#ldapsasl_bind_unknownerror_nocert">ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: 
      Unknown error – user certificate not found</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before starting to troubleshoot, make sure 
    of the following in your MDS environment:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set GLOBUS_LOCATION on both client and 
      server machines.</li>
      <li>Source your environment for the type of 
      shell you are using, on both client and server.</li>
      <li>For authenticated access to MDS:<br>
      - Obtain a user certificate for yourself.<br>
      - Obtain an LDAP certificate for your server.<br>
      - Create a proxy on the client.</li>
      <li>Start MDS on the server, with the 

      </code>

      <code>
      globus-mds start</code><code> 
      (formerly 

      </code>

      <code>
      SXXgris start</code>) command.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These configuration procedures are 
    described in detail in the <i>
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a></i>.</p>

    <p><a name="ldap_bind_cantcontactserver">
    ldap_bind: Can’t contact LDAP server</a></p>
    </b>
    <p>This message means that the client can’t 
    contact the server.</p>
    <p>The first thing to check is that the slapd 
    process is running on the designated server and is listening on the 
    designated port. You can use the 

    <code>
    ps</code> command to do this.</p>
    <p>The server’s port number is specified in 
    the grid-info.conf file on the server. Either the port number (<code>-p</code><code> 
    option) specified on the 

      </code>

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code> command 
    issued from the client does not match the server’s port number, or the port 
    number specified in the grid-info.conf file on the client does not match the 
    server’s port number.</p>
    <p>Changing the port number from the client to 
    match that set for the server should solve the problem.</p>
    <p>This message is produced as the result of 
    an anonymous query; certificates don’t matter in this case.</p>
    <p>Also check that the host name is correctly 
    specified with the 

    <code>
    FQHN</code><code> on the 

      </code>

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code> command 
    issued from the client.</p>
    <p>If you are using a firewall, make sure that 
    your server will accept inbound connections on port 2135. For more 
    information on using the Globus Toolkit with firewalls, refer to
    <a href="../../../security/firewalls/">
    <i>Globus Toolkit Firewall Requirements</i></a>.</p>
    <b>
    <p><a name="nosuchobject">No such object</a></p>
    </b>
    <p>This message appears as in the following 
    example, as a result of a 

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code> query:</p>
    <p># search result</p>
    <p>search: 2</p>
    <p>result: 32 No such object</p>
    <p>This means the client is not connecting to 
    the GIIS inside the slapd server; the 

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code> command 
    is insufficiently specified to know where to start the search.</p>
    <p>If the 

    <code>
    -b basedn</code><code> option is not 
    specified on the on the 

      </code>

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code><code> command 
    from the client, the command supplies a default like 

      </code>

    <code>
    mds-vo-name=local,o=grid</code><code>, 
    but that may be incorrect if there is no corresponding 

      </code>

    <code>
    vo</code><code> on the server (if, for 
    example, it has been removed from the server's grid-info.conf file).&nbsp; 
    The query may need a more specific 

      </code>

    <code>
    -b</code><code>

      </code>

    
    parameter that the server can identify.</p>
    <p>Also, make sure that the value of 

    <code>
    mds-vo-name</code> is specified 
    correctly on the command line.</p>

    <p><a name="ldapsasl_bind_cantcontactserver">ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: 
    Can’t contact LDAP server</a></p>
    </b>
    <p>This message may mean that there is some 
    problem in your certification/security configuration that is preventing your 
    query from accessing the LDAP server. </p>
    <p>If you get this message as a result of an 
    authenticated query, the first thing to try is an anonymous query (<code>-x</code><code> 
    option on 

      </code>

    <code>
    grid-info-search</code>). If the 
    anonymous query produces the &quot;ldap_bind: Can’t contact LDAP server&quot; message 
    described above, this indicates a server connection problem. Follow the 
    suggestions described under that message to resolve the problem.</p>
    <p>If the anonymous query works, then you need 
    to check the following in your certification/security configuration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That you have a user certificate for 
      yourself, as described in the <i>
      <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.2 
      Installation Instructions</a></i>, and that it is installed correctly in 
      ~/.globus.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>That you have an LDAP certificate for 
      the server, as described in the <i>
      <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a></i>, 
      and that it is installed correctly in /etc/grid-security/ldap.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li>That you have a valid proxy, created on 
      the client as described in the <i>
      <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a></i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>
    <p><a name="ldapsasl_bind_localerror">
    ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: local error</a></p>
    </b>
    <p>This message is typically produced as the 
    result of an authenticated query, the typical scenario being that anonymous 
    queries work, while authenticated queries do not.</p>
    <p>This message means that you either do not 
    have a valid proxy, or that your proxy is not set up correctly. (For 
    example, your proxy may have expired.)</p>
    <p>You obtain a proxy as described in the <i>
    <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.2 
    Installation Instructions</a> </i>and in the <i>
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS 2.2 User’s Guide</a></i>. 
    You can check the status of existing proxies with the 

    <code>
    grid-proxy-info</code> command. A 
    file name like X509up_u&lt;uid&gt; (in the /tmp directory) shows you that a proxy 
    is valid. The X509_USER_PROXY environment variable (in the 
    /etc/grid-info-server-env.conf file) should point to a valid proxy, by 
    default the file in /tmp.</p>
    <p>If your proxy appears to be current and 
    correct, then make sure that the /etc/hosts file is set up correctly, with a 
    fully qualified host name and that name entered before the shortened host 
    name on each line. Refer to the <i>
    <a href="FAQ.html#hostnameresolution">MDS FAQ</a></i> 
    on this topic for more details.</p>
