<ol>
  <li><a name="twelve"><code>GRAM Job Submission failed because the connection to the server
    failed (check host and port) (error code 12)</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Your client is unable to contact the gatekeeper specified. Possible causes include: <ul>
      <li>The gatekeeper is not running<br>
      </li>
      <li>The host is not reachable.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The gatekeeper is on a non-standard port<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Make sure the gatekeeper is being launched by inetd or xinetd. Review <a href="guide-startup.html#gram">the
        Admin Guide</a> if you do not
    know how to do this. Check to make sure that ordinary TCP/IP connections are possible; can
    you ssh to the host, or ping it? If you cannot, then you probably can't submit jobs
    either. Check for typos in the hostname.</p>
    <p>Try telnetting to port 2119. If you see a &quot;Unable to load shared library&quot;,
    the gatekeeper was not built statically, and does not have an appropriate LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    set. If that is the case, either rebuild it statically, or set the environment variable
    for the gatekeeper. In inetd, use /usr/bin/env to wrap the launch of the gatekeeper, or in
    xinetd, use the &quot;env=&quot; option.</p>
    <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log if it exists. It may tell you that
    the private key is insecure, so it refuses to start. In that case, fix the permissions of
    the key to be read only by the owner.</p>
    <p>If the gatekeeper is on a non-standard port, be sure to use a contact string of
    host:port.</p>

  </li>
  <li><a name="library"><code>error in loading shared libraries</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is not set. </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>If you receive this as a client, make sure to read in either
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh (if you are using a Bourne-like shell) or
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh (if you are using a C-like shell)</p>

  </li>
  <li><a name="authentication"><code>GRAM Job submission failed because authentication with
    the remote server failed (error code 7)</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log on the remote server. You will
    probably see something like:</p>
    <p><code>Authenticated globus user: /O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=your.domain/OU=Your Name<br>
    Failure: globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization. rc =1</code> </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>This indicates that your account is not in the grid-mapfile. Create the grid-mapfile in
    /etc/grid-security (or wherever the -gridmap flag in
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf points to) with an entry pairing your subject
    name to your user name. Review <a href="guide-startup.html#gram">the
    Admin Guide</a> if you do not know how to do this.</p>
    <p><a href="#errors">Back to top</a></p>
    <hr>
  </li>
  <li><a name="expected"><code>GRAM Job submission failed because authentication failed:
    Expected target subject name=&quot;/CN=host/hostname&quot;</code><br>
    <code>Target returned subject name=&quot;/O=Grid/O=Globus/CN=hostname.domain.edu&quot;
    (error code 7)</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>New installations will often see errors like the above where the expected target
    subject name has just the unqualified hostname but the target returned subject name has
    the fully qualified domain name (e.g. expected is &quot;hostname&quot; but returned is
    &quot;hostname.domain.edu&quot;).</p>
    <p>This is usually becuase the client looks up the target host's IP address in /etc/hosts
    and only gets the simple hostname back. </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The solution is to edit the /etc/hosts file so that it returns the fully qualified
    domain name. To do this find the line in /etc/hosts that has the target host listed and
    make sure it looks like:</p>
    <p><code>xx.xx.xx.xx hostname.domain.edu hostname</code></p>
    <p>Where &quot;xx.xx.xx.xx&quot; should be the numeric IP address of the host and
    hostname.domain.edu should be replaced with the actual hostname in question. The trick is
    to make sure the full name (hostname.domain.edu) is listed before the nickname (hostname).</p>
    <p>If this only happens with your own host, see the explanation of the <a href="#stdout">failed
    to open stdout</a> error, specifically about how to set the <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code>
    for your host.</p>

  </li>
  <li><a name="proxy"><code>Problem with local credentials no proxy credentials: run
    grid-proxy-init or wgpi first</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>You do not have a valid proxy.</p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Run grid-proxy-init</p>
    <p><a href="#errors">Back to top</a></p>
    <hr>
  </li>
  <li><a name="time"><code>GRAM Job submission failed because authentication failed: remote
    side did not like my creds for unknown reason</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log on the remote host. It probably
    says &quot;remote certificate not yet valid&quot;. This indicates that the client host has
    a date set greater than five minutes in the future relative to the remote host.</p>
    <p>Try typing &quot;date -u&quot; on both systems at the same time to verify this. (The
    &quot;-u&quot; specifies that the time should be displayed in universal time, also known
    as UTC or GMT.) </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, synchronize the hosts using NTP. Otherwise, unless you are willing to set
    the client host date back, you will have to wait until the remote server believes that
    your proxy is valid. Also, be sure to check your shell environment to see if you have any
    time zone variables set.</p>

  </li>
  <li><a name="stdout"><code>GRAM Job submission failed because the job manager failed to open
    stdout (error code 73)</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>The remote job manager is unable to open a connection back to your client host.
    Possible causes include: <ul>
      <li>Bad results from globus-hostname. Try running globus-hostname on your client. It should
        output the fully qualified domain name of your host. This is the information which the
        GRAM client tools use to let the jobmanager on the remote server know who to open a
        connection to. If it does not give a fully qualified domain name, the remote host may be
        unable to open a connection back to your host.</li>
      <li>A firewall. If a firewall blocks the jobmanager's attempted connection back to your
        host, this error will result.</li>
      <li>Troubles in the ~/.globus/.gass_cache on the remote host. This is the least frequent
        cause of this error. It could relate to NFS or AFS issues on the remote host.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Depending on the cause from above, try the following solutions: <ul>
      <li>Fix the result of 'hostname' itself. You can accomplish this by editing /etc/hosts and
        adding the fully qualified domain name of your host to this file. See how to do this in
        the explanation of the <a href="#expected">expected target subject</a> error. If you
        cannot do this, or do not want to do this, you can set the <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code>
        environment variable to override the result of globus-hostname. Set <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code>
        to the fully qualified domain name of your host.</li>
      <li>To cope with a firewall, use the <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> environment
        variable. If your host is behind a firewall, set <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> to the
        allowable incoming connections on your firewall. If the firewall is in front of the remote
        server, you will need the remote site to set <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> in the
        gatekeeper's environment to the allowable incoming range of the firewall in front of the
        remote server. If there are firewalls on both sides, perform both of the above steps. Note
        that the allowable ranges do not need to coincide on the two firewalls; it is, however,
        necessary that the <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> be valid for both incoming and
        outgoing connections of the firewall it is set for.</li>
      <li>If you are working with AFS, you will want the .gass_cache directory to be a link to a
        local filesystem. If you are having NFS trouble, you will need to fix it, which is beyond
        the scope of this document.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li><a name="rsl"><code>GRAM Job submission failed because the provided RSL string includes
    variables that could not be identified (error code 39)</code></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>You submitted a job which specifies an RSL substitution which the remote jobmanager
    does not recognize. The most common case is using a 2.x version of
    globus-job-get-output with a 1.1.x gatekeeper/jobmanager.</p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Currently, globus-job-get-output will not work between a 2.x client and a 1.1.x
    gatekeeper. Work is in progress to ensure interoperability by the final release. In the
    meantime, you should be able to modify the globus-job-get-output script to use
    $(GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH) instead of $(GLOBUS_LOCATION).</p>
