<p>The Globus Project provides software tools that make it easier to build computational
grids and grid-based applications. These tools are collectively called the Globus
Toolkit(tm).</p>

<p>The composition of the Globus Toolkit can be pictured as three pillars. Each pillar
represents a primary component of the Globus Toolkit and makes use of a common foundation
of security.</p>

<p>GRAM implements a resource management protocol, MDS implements an information services
protocol, and GridFTP implements a data transfer protocol. They all use the GSI security
protocol at the connection layer.</p>

<p>These technologies are designed to be modular, but complementary. You can download the
components separately, or all together. Additionally, you can obtain the client software
independently of the server software if you'd like.</p>

<p>The software is now packaged using the <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/ACES/GPT/">Grid Packaging Toolkit</a>, developed
in collaboration with the NCSA.</p>

<h2>Overview of Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI)</h2>

<p>The Globus Toolkit uses the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) for enabling secure
authentication and communication over an open network. GSI provides a number of useful
services for Grids, including mutual authentication and single sign-on.</p>

<p>The primary motivations behind the GSI are: 

<ul>
  <li>The need for secure communication (authenticated and perhaps confidential) between
    elements of a computational Grid.</li>
  <li>The need to support security across organizational boundaries, thus prohibiting a
    centrally-managed security system.</li>
  <li>The need to support &quot;single sign-on&quot; for users of the Grid, including
    delegation of credentials for computations that involve multiple resources and/or sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>GSI is based on public key encryption, X.509 certificates, and the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) communication protocol. Extensions to these standards have been added for single
sign-on and delegation. The Globus Toolkit's implementation of the GSI adheres to the
Generic Security Service API (GSS-API), which is a standard API for security systems
promoted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../security/">the GSI webpage</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Overview of GRAM</h2>

<p>The Globus resource management architecture is a layered system in which a high-level
global resource management services are layered on top of local resource allocation
services. Below is an overview of the various components in the Globus resource management
architecture.</p>

<p>
<img src="globus_rm_structure.gif" alt="GRAM structure" width="400" height="213"> </p>

<p>From the above illustration, we can see that there are three main components to the
Globus resource management system are an extensible resource specification language, the
interface to local resource management tools, and a co-allocator. 

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="../gram/rsl_spec1.html">Resource Specification Language</a></b>
    <p>The RSL provides a method for exchanging information about resource requirements
    between all of the components in the Globus resource management architecture.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="../gram/">Globus Resource Allocation Manager</a></b> 
    <p>The
    GRAM provides a standardized interface to all of the various local resource management
    tools that a site might have in place, including LSF, NQE, LoadLeveler, and Condor.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="../duroc/">DUROC</a></b> 
    <p>DUROC provides a
    co-allocation service; that is, it coordinates a single request that may span multiple
    GRAMs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additonally, the Information Service is provided by MDS. There is currently no Resource
Broker in the Globus Toolkit.</p>

<h2>Overview of MDS</h2>

<p>The Globus Metacomputing Directory Service (MDS) provides the necessary tools to build
an LDAP-based information infrastructure for computational grids.</p>

<p>MDS uses the LDAP protocol as a uniform means of querying system information from a
rich variety of system components, and for optionally constructing a uniform namespace for
resource information across a system that may involve many organizations.</p>

<p>The Grid Resource Information Service (GRIS) provides a uniform means of querying
resources on a computational grid for their current configuration, capabilities, and
status. Such resources include, but are not limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>computation nodes</li>
  <li>data storage systems</li>
  <li>scientific instruments</li>
  <li>network links</li>
  <li>databases</li>
</ul>

<p>The GRIS can be easily extended to provide additional information, which will be
covered in the <a href="guide-configure.html">advanced configuration</a> section.</p>

<p>The Grid Index Information Service (GIIS) provides a means of knitting together
arbitrary GRIS services to provide a coherent system image that can be explored or
searched by grid applications. GIISes thus provide a mechanism for identifying
&quot;interesting&quot; resources, where &quot;interesting&quot; can be defined
arbitrarily. For example, a GIIS could list all of the computational resources available
within a confederation of laboratories, or all of the distributed data storage systems
owned by a particular agency. A GIIS could pool information about all of the grid
resources (computation, data, networks, instruments) in a particular research consortium,
thus providing a coherent system image of that consortium's computational grid.</p>

<h2>Overview of GridFTP</h2>

<p>GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol optimized for
high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The GridFTP protocol is based on FTP, the
highly-popular Internet file transfer protocol. We have selected a set of protocol
features and extensions defined already in IETF RFCs and added a few additional features
to meet requirements from current data grid projects.</p>

<p>Our white paper, <i><a
href="../datagrid/deliverables/C2WPdraft3.pdf">GridFTP: Universal Data
Transfer for the Grid</a></i>, describes the motivations behind this work in more detail.
A subsequent update titled <cite><a
href="../datagrid/deliverables/GridFTP-Overview-200201.pdf">GridFTP
Update, January 2002</a></cite> provides the latest news regarding GridFTP, including
current status and plans for future development.</p>

<h3>Protocol Features</h3>

<p>GridFTP provides the following protocol features. 

<ul>
  <li><a href="../gsi/">GSI security</a> on control and data channels </li>
  <li>Multiple data channels for parallel transfers </li>
  <li>Partial file transfers </li>
  <li>Third-party (direct server-to-server) transfers </li>
  <li>Authenticated data channels </li>
  <li>Reusable data channels </li>
  <li>Command pipelining </li>
</ul>

<p>We have prepared a <a
href="http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/dsl/GridFTP-Protocol-RFC-Draft.pdf">draft specification</a>
for the GridFTP protocol through the Global Grid Forum, and intend to submit a draft
standard to the IETF for review and approval.</p>
