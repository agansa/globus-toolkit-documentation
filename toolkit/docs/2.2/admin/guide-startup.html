<p>These instructions will show you how to start up the various server daemons that you
now have on your system. The next section will show you how to verify that they are
operating correctly.&nbsp; In cases where we refer to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, please
use your system-equivalent if you have one.&nbsp; E.g., LIBPATH or
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH.&nbsp; See your administrator if you do not know which
variable to use.

<h2><a name="gram"></a>Starting GRAM</h2>


<p>While running globus-personal-gatekeeper as a user is a good test, you will want to
configure your machine to run globus-gatekeeper as root, so that other people will be able
to use your gatekeeper. If you just run the personal gatekeeper, you won't have authority
to su to other user accounts. To setup a full gatekeeper, you will need to make the
following modifications as root: </p>

<p>In /etc/services, add the service name &quot;gsigatekeeper&quot; to port 2119. </p>

<pre>gsigatekeeper      2119/tcp                   # Globus Gatekeeper</pre>

<p>Depending on whether your host is running inetd or xinetd, you will need to modify its
configuration. If the directory /etc/xinetd.d/ exists, then your host is likely running
xinetd. If the directory doesn't exist, your host is likely running inetd. Follow the
appropriate instructions below according to what your host is running. 

<ul>
  <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
  For inetd, add the following entry, all on one line, to /etc/inetd.conf. Be sure to
  replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your
  environment. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; gsigatekeeper stream tcp nowait root<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/env env
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gatekeeper<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -conf GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf<br>
  </p>
  <p>As noted earlier in this guide, this entry has changed from the
  entry provided for the gatekeeper in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's Guide.&nbsp;
  The reason is that if you followed the instructions from the install section, you do not
  have a static gatekeeper.&nbsp; This requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the
  gatekeeper can dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp; To
  accomplish the setting of the environment variable in inetd, we use /usr/bin/env (the
  location may vary on your system) to first set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and then to call the
  gatekeeper itself. </p>
  <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security update to your
  installation, the gatekeeper will pick it up dynamically without your having to rebuild
  it. </p>
  <p><b>Xinetd</b><br>
  For xinetd, add a file called &quot;globus-gatekeeper&quot; to the /etc/xinetd.d/
  directory that has the following contents. Be sure to replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below with
  the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your environment. </p>
  <pre>   service gsigatekeeper
   {
      socket_type  = stream
      protocol     = tcp
      wait         = no
      user         = root
      env          = LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
      server       = GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gatekeeper
      server_args  = -conf GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf
      disable      = no
   }</pre>
  <p>As noted earlier in this guide, this entry has changed from the
  entry provided for the gatekeeper in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's Guide.&nbsp;
  The reason is that if you followed the instructions from the install section, you do not
  have a static gatekeeper.&nbsp; This requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the
  gatekeeper can dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp; To
  accomplish the setting of the environment variable in xinetd, we use the &quot;env =&quot;
  option to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the gatekeeper's environment. </p>
  <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security update to your
  installation, the gatekeeper will pick it up dynamically without your having to rebuild
  it. </p>
</ul>

<p>After you have added the globus-gatekeeper service to either inetd or xinetd, you will
need to notify inetd (or xinetd) that its configuration file has changed. To do this,
follow the instructions for the server you are running below. 

<ul>
  <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
  On most Linux systems, you can simply run `killall -HUP inetd` </p>
  <p>On other systems, the following has the same effect: ps aux | grep inetd | awk '{print
  $2;}' | xargs kill -HUP </p>
  <p><b>Xinetd</b><br>
  On most linux systems, you can simply run `/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart`.&nbsp; Your
  system may also support the &quot;reload&quot; option. </p>
  <p>On other systems (or if that doesn't work), see man xinetd. </p>
</ul>

<p>At this point, your gatekeeper will start up when a connection comes in to port 2119,
and will keep a log of its activity in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log</code>.
However, it does not yet have any authorization mapping between certificate subjects and
usernames. You will need to create a file named /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile which
consists of single line entries listing a certificate subject and a username, like this: </p>

<pre>&quot;/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=your.domain/CN=Your Name&quot;    youruserid
    </pre>

<p>You can check your subject name using <code>grid-cert-info -subject</code>.&nbsp;
There are utility commands in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile* for adding
entries, removing entries, and checking consistency. </p>

<h2><a
name="mds"></a>Starting MDS</h2>


<p>Start MDS 2.2 with the following command: </p>

<pre>   % GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-mds start
</pre>

<p>This command starts the OpenLDAP 2.0 slapd server for the GRIS. It does not require
the environment variable $GLOBUS_LOCATION to be set. To make this startup automatic, place it
in the startup scripts of your machine. Contact your system administrator to determine
where the call to this script needs to be placed. On a RedHat Linux system, the answer is
/etc/rc.d/init.d, with a call to that script made in the appropriate /etc/rc.d/rc?.d
(where ? is the default runlevel of your system, as specified in /etc/inittab). </p>

<p>There is a single slapd instance for both GRIS and GIIS. </p>

<p>You are now set for anonymous queries. For non-anonymous queries, you will need a
server certificate, and a grid-mapfile for MDS.&nbsp; MDS defaults to
using the same grid-mapfile as GRAM, namely /<code>etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</code>.&nbsp;
To change that location, modify $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-server-env.conf. </p>


<h2><a name="gridftp"></a>Setting up a GridFTP server</h2>


<p>Setting up GridFTP is similar to setting up a gatekeeper. Make the following changes to
your system as root: </p>

<p>Add an entry to /etc/services reading: </p>

<pre>   gsiftp  2811/tcp
</pre>

<p>Depending on whether your host is running inetd or xinetd, you will need to modify
its
configuration file. 

<ul>
  <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
  For inetd, add the following entry, all on one line, to /etc/inetd.conf. Be sure to
  replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your
  environment. </p>
  <pre>    gsiftp  stream  tcp     nowait  root
      /usr/bin/env env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
      GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION
</pre>
  <p>As noted earlier in this guide, this entry has changed from the
  entry provided for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
  Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions from the install section,
  you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp; This requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so
  that the server can dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp;
  To accomplish the setting of the environment variable in inetd, we use /usr/bin/env (the
  location may vary on your system) to first set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and then to call in.ftpd
  itself. </p>
  <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security update to your
  installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up dynamically without your having to
  rebuild it. </p>
  <p><b>Xinetd</b><br>
  For xinetd, add a file called &quot;grid-ftp&quot; to the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory that
  has the following contents. Be sure to replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value
  of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your environment. </p>
  <pre>    service gsiftp
    {
	    instances               = 1000
	    socket_type             = stream
	    wait                    = no
	    user                    = root
	    env			    = LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
	    server                  = GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd
	    server_args             = -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION
	    log_on_success         += DURATION USERID
	    log_on_failure         += USERID
	    nice                    = 10
            disable                 = no
    }
</pre>
  <p>As noted earlier in this guide, this entry has changed from the
  entry provided for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
  Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions from the install section,
  you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp; This requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so
  that the server can dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp;
  To accomplish the setting of the environment variable in xinetd, we use the &quot;env
  =&quot; option to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the gatekeeper's environment. </p>
  <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security update to your
  installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up dynamically without your having to
  rebuild it. </p>
</ul>

<p>The -G GLOBUS_LOCATION (remember to substitute your real GLOBUS_LOCATION) tells the
in.ftpd to look for ftpaccess in $GLOBUS_LOCATION.&nbsp; If you do not specify this flag,
the server will use /etc/ftpaccess. </p>

<p>After you have added the gridftp service to either inetd or xinetd, you will need to
notify inetd (or xinetd) that its configuration file has changed. To do this, follow the
instructions for the server you are running below. 

<ul>
  <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
  On most linux systems, you can simply run `killall -HUP inetd` </p>
  <p>On other systems, the following has the same effect: ps aux | grep inetd | awk '{print
  $2;}' | xargs kill -HUP </p>
  <p><b>Xinetd</b><br>
  On most linux systems, you can simply run `/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart` </p>
  <p>On other systems (or if that doesn't work), see man xinetd. </p>
  <p>GridFTP uses /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile for authorization, just like GRAM.</p>
</ul>
