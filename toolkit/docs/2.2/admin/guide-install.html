<h2><a name="download"></a>Choosing Bundles </h2>
<p>The Globus Toolkit 2.4 uses the Grid Packaging Technology for
  installation. A collection of GPT packages is called a &quot;bundle&quot;.
  There are source and binary bundles available. Here are some guidelines to
  help you choose what to download: 
  
<ol>
  <li><strong>Installing from a binary distribution</strong><br>
    <br>
    If you are obtaining the Globus Toolkit primarily to build a Grid, to develop Grid-enabled
    applications using our libraries, or to use our Grid tools, you may choose to obtain
    precompiled binaries. By doing this, you can save the storage space required by the code
    and you can skip the compilation phase of your installation.&nbsp; Also,
    GPT2 allows source packages may to be installed on top of a binary installation.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Install from a source distribution</strong><br>
    <br>
    If you intend to make changes to the Globus Toolkit code or debug the Globus Toolkit code
    at the source level, or if you need to install the Globus Toolkit on a system for which
    precompiled binaries are not available, then you must obtain the source code, compile it
    yourself using our build tools, and install the resulting libraries and programs. </li>
</ol>

<p>Whether you choose source or binary bundles, the first step in either choice is to
download and install the Grid Packaging Toolkit. Once that is installed and configured,
you will download and install the bundles of your choice.</p>

<h3>What bundles are available?</h3>

<p>There are several bundles available, packaged according to module. The modules are
described in the <a href="guide-overview.html">overview</a>.</p>


<h4>Source bundles </h4>

<p>Source bundles are available for clients, servers, and SDKs.&nbsp; A complete
installation of the toolkit consists of installing all of these bundles.&nbsp; If you are
not familiar with the toolkit, we recommend that you install all the bundles until you are
more familiar with the components that will be required at your site.</p>

<p>The server bundle will contain the necessary pieces to install the servers, but do not
contain everything required to be a client of those servers.&nbsp; The client bundle
contains the client tools, but not the server components.&nbsp; The SDK for a component
contains the libraries and headers required to compile and link your programs against that
component. If you want to develop against Globus, get the SDK bundle. This includes
scenarios where you want to install something like MPICH-G2 on top of Globus.</p>


<h4>Binary bundles </h4>

<p>Binary bundles have been built for specific platforms. For any given platform, you have
a choice of downloading the clients, servers, or both.</p>

<h4>Extra Packages</h4>

<p>There are some extra packages available with Globus 2.4 which only apply to
certain setups.&nbsp; These are the scheduler-specific jobmanager packages, and
the gram-reporter packages.&nbsp; By default, GRAM server bundles will come with
only the fork jobmanager, which executes jobs on the local machine.&nbsp; If you
have a scheduler installed that you would like to have GRAM integrate with, download the appropriate jobmanager package, and see the <a href="guide-configure.html">
Advanced Configuration</a> section of the guide.  </p>

<p>The gram-reporter packages publish scheduler-specific information into
MDS.&nbsp; Only the &quot;All&quot; and &quot;All Server&quot; binary bundles
contain the gram-reporter packages by default, since that is the only bundle
which contains both GRAM and MDS.&nbsp; If you are planning on installing both
GRAM and MDS, you may want to download the gram-reporter packages as well.  </p>

<p>The extra packages are available from the <a href="../../../downloads/2.2/">
Globus 2.2 download page.</a>  </p>

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installing Globus</h2>

<p>The installation will follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Create a user named &quot;globus&quot; (optional, but recommended)</li>
  <li>Create a location to install Globus</li>
  <li>Download and install GPT</li>
  <li>Download source or binary bundles</li>
  <li>Use GPT to install the bundles</li>
  <li>Configure the installation</li>
</ol>


<h3>Create a user named &quot;globus&quot; </h3>

<p>Create an account named &quot;globus&quot; using whatever tool is appropriate for your
system. The rest of these instructions assume that you are performing these commands as
the user named &quot;globus&quot;, except where noted.</p>

<p>If you do not have root privileges to create this account, you can install as your
ordinary user account.&nbsp; If you do have root, we recommend the creation of this user
instead of installing it directly as root.&nbsp; If your site policy requires installation
as root, that is fine.&nbsp; Take special note in the verification section, however, for
there are some verification tests that should <b>not</b> be run as root.</p>


<h3>Create a location to install Globus </h3>

<p>Create a directory where you want to install the Globus Toolkit.&nbsp; It should be
owned by the user named &quot;globus&quot; (or your user account, if you did not create
the globus account).</p>

<p>Set the environment variable GLOBUS_LOCATION to point to this location. You should keep
the area where you download the bundles and build them separate from the final
installation location.&nbsp; Also set the environment variable GPT_LOCATION to where you
would like the GPT software installed.&nbsp; We recommend creating separate locations for
the two components.</p>


<h3>Download GPT</h3>

<p>The GPT software is developed at NCSA, and the latest version is available from <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/ACES/GPT/">the GPT homepage</a>. There is also a
link to GPT from: <a href="../../../downloads/2.2/">the GT2
download page</a>.</p>

<p>Perl 5.005 or greater is required to use GPT. You can download Perl from <a
href="http://www.perl.com/">www.perl.com</a>.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>
GPT depends on GNU tar and GNU make.&nbsp; We have found that on
non-GNU (i.e. non-Linux) systems it helps to have these tools available as gtar and gmake.</p>


<h3>Install GPT </h3>

<p>Unzip and untar the file:</p>
<code>
% gzip -dc gpt-*.tar.gz | tar xf - </code>

<p>This will create a directory named &quot;gpt-version/&quot;. cd into the directory:</p>
<code>
% cd gpt-*</code>

<p>Run build_gpt. This will install GPT into $GPT_LOCATION.</p>
<code>
% ./build_gpt</code>

<p><b>Note:</b> If your perl 5.005 executable is not named &quot;perl&quot; or is not in
your command search path, add --with-perl={perl-cmd} to the build_gpt command to identify
the perl executable to be used by the packaging tools.&nbsp; Also, GPT is using the
Archive::Tar perl module to perform bundle extraction.&nbsp; Some system native tar
executables produce output which the module does not expect, like &quot;blocksize =
256&quot;.&nbsp; If you run into such an error, re-compile GPT with a GNU tar at the front
of your path. </p>


<h3>Download bundles </h3>

<p>You can download Source or Binary bundles from the <a href="../../../downloads/2.2/">download</a>
page.&nbsp; We recommend that you not download the bundles into GLOBUS_LOCATION itself, as
the build process will create some directories that you will delete later, most notably
the BUILD/ subdirectory if you build from source.</p>

<h3>Install bundles </h3>

<p>The command to install a binary bundle with GPT 2 is</p>

<pre>$GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-install &lt;options&gt; &lt;bundle-name&gt; &lt;flavor[s]&gt;</pre>

<p>The command to build a source bundle with GPT 2 is</p>

<pre>$GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build &lt;options&gt; &lt;bundle-name&gt; &lt;flavor[s]&gt;</pre>

<p>Both commands place the resulting
installation into $GLOBUS_LOCATION. </p>

<p>Choose the flavor name and options for each bundle based on the following table: 

<ul>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td><b>BUNDLE</b></td>
      <td></td>
      <td><b>FLAVORS</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Management Client </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Management SDK </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Management Server </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Information Services Client </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbgpthr </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Information Services Server </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbgpthr </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Information Services SDK </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbgpthr </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource Management Client </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource Management SDK* </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource Management Server&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Replica</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbgpthr</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GSI</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>gcc32dbg</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b>
If you are installing the replica bundle you will have to follow a different set of <a
href="../replica.html">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
You do not need to install the GSI bundle if you have installed or plan to install any of
the other bundles. It is meant for applications which only depend on GSI.</p>

<p>*If you have a vendor-native MPI implementation, you can use <code>&quot;mpicc&quot;</code>
instead of &quot;gcc&quot; to make the Toolkit aware of the native MPI.&nbsp; In
this case, mpicc should be on your path.&nbsp; This is used by MPICH-G2 if you install it.</p>

<p>For GPT2, you can set a -logdir=&lt;dir&gt; option to keep logs.</p>

<h3>Configure the installation</h3>
<p>  After installing all of the bundles you want, run <code>$GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-postinstall</code> to
  run the configuration scripts that will customize your Toolkit installation
  to your current host.&nbsp; A reminder will scroll by that you need to run
  setup-gsi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have root on the system, you should become root and run <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-gsi</code>.&nbsp;
This will install some GSI files into /etc/grid-security.&nbsp; If you do not have root on
the system, run <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-gsi -nonroot</code> to install
the security information into <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc</code> instead of <code>/etc/grid-security</code>.&nbsp;
The -nonroot option is aimed at client-side installs.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>  You still need to acquire some certificates to be able to use your installation. In the <a
href="guide-verify.html">next section</a>, we will go over how to acquire certificates,
  and verify that your installation works correctly.</p>
<h2><a name="GPT">More about GPT</a></h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: You may skip this section if you are happy building with gcc on a 32 bit
platform with debugging and pthreads.</p>

<p>Flavor names are a collection of compile time options. This lets you select between
compilers (gcc, vendorcc, mpicc), architecture (32 or 64 bit), debugging or not, and threaded
or not. You also choose whether to make something static at build time.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you look at the table of how to build the different packages, you can
understand that the suggested flavors are for a 32 bit architecture with debugging turned
on, always using gcc, and using pthreads when threading is applicable.</p>

<p>If you want to change any of these options, change the corresponding chunk of the
flavor name. For instance, vendorcc64dbgmpi will build with 'cc', 64 bit, debugging on,
using your native MPI. You can also change threading implementations, to use sproc or
Solaris threads, for instance.</p>

<p>These options will be passed in the appropriate way to all of the packages in a bundle.
To see a master list of flavors, and what options they pass, install GPT and run <code>globus-flavor-configuration
-standard</code>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to install a single bundle with more than one flavor. This is, in
fact, one of the reasons that flavors exist. A flavored version of a library contains its
flavor name in the name of the library itself. Take a look in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</code>
after installing some bundles to see. So if you install the SDK bundles, and you might
want to build both threaded and non-threaded apps on top of them, build them with both
threaded and non-threaded flavors.</p>
