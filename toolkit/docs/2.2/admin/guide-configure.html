<h2><a name="gram"></a>Configuring GRAM</h2>


<p>Advanced configuration of GRAM consists of the following tasks: 

<ol>
  <li><a href="#jobmanager">Adding jobmanagers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#addca">Adding trust to a new CA/removing trust from an old CA</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ca">Starting your own CA</a></li>
  <li><a href="#gram-reporter">Adding gram-reporter</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><a name="jobmanager"><b>Adding jobmanagers</b></a><br>
    <p>The fork job manager scheduler package is the only one included in the Resource
    Management service bundle.&nbsp; It will be installed when running gpt-postinstall.&nbsp;
    Additional schedulers can be added by installing the job manager setup package for your
    scheduler.&nbsp; Look for the one appropriate to your scheduler on the <a
    href="../../../downloads/2.2/">download</a> page.&nbsp; To install it, run &quot;gpt-install
    &lt;scheduler-setup-packages&gt;&quot;, then &quot;gpt-postinstall&quot;.</p>
    <p>The first job manager scheduler package installed will be installed as the default job
    manager service (e.g. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/grid-services/jobmanager).&nbsp; Additional job
    manager scheduler packages installed will be installed using the convention
    &quot;jobmanager-&lt;scheduler-name&gt;&quot; (e.g.
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/grid-services/jobmanager-pbs).</p>
    <p>All job manager scheduler setup packages have the argument &quot;-service-name
    &lt;name&gt;&quot; in order to install a non-fork scheduler as the default job manager
    service.&nbsp; For example, this command will set the pbs scheduler as the default job
    manager service:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; % setup-globus-job-manager-pbs -service-name jobmanager</p>
    <p>If you need to alter the behavior of the job manager scheduler interface, or you want
    to create a new job manager scheduler interface for a scheduler that is not available, see
    this <a
    href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c-globus-2.2/globus_gram_job_manager/html/index.html">tutorial
    </a>web page.</p>
    <p>The details of how to make a client submit to a non-default gatekeeper is covered in
    the <a href="guide-user.html">user's guide section</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If you wish to have your job manager report into your MDS, you need to
    install the appropriate GRAM Reporter setup package for your scheduler.&nbsp; The GRAM
    Reporter setup packages for each scheduler can be found on the <a href="../../../downloads/2.2/">download</a>
    page.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ca"><b>Adding trust to a new CA/removing trust from an old CA</b></a><br>
    <p>The set of trusted Certificate Authorities is contained in the <code>/etc/grid-security/certificates</code>
    directory. By default, that directory contains two entries. One, called <code>42864e48.0</code>
    is the public certificate of the Globus CA. The other, called <code>42864e48.signing_policy</code>
    is the signing policy for the Globus CA certificate.</p>
    <p>The name &quot;42864e8&quot; comes from the openssl <code>-hash</code> option. If you
    create your own Certificate Authority, you can use the command <code>openssl x509 -in
    yourcert.pem -noout -hash</code> to determine its hash value. You will need to place a
    copy of that public certificate, under the name <code>hash.0</code> (where
    &quot;hash&quot; corresponds to the output of the openssl command) in the <code>/etc/grid-security/certificates</code>
    of every Toolkit installation which you want to trust certificates which your CA has
    signed. Additionally, you will have to create a <code>hash.signing_policy</code> file
    which contains the DN of your CA, as well as the namespace for which your CA signs.</p>
    <p>Namespaces for CAs are designed to be unique. If you do establish your own CA, do not
    use the &quot;/O=Grid/O=Globus&quot; namespace. That is reserved for the Globus CA.</p>
    <p>Removing trust for a particular CA is as easy as deleting the two files which
    correspond to the CA. First, look for the <code>.signing_policy</code> which corresponds
    to the CA you want to remove. Then remove both the <code>.signing_policy</code> and <code>.0</code>
    file that correspond to that hash.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ca"></a><b>Starting your own CA
    </b>
    <p>There is now a Globus package named <a
    href="../../2.4/gsi/simple-ca.html">Simple CA</a> which is designed to
    help you establish a CA for your test Grid.
    <p></li>
  <li><a name="gram-reporter"></a><b>Adding gram-reporter
    </b>
    <p>If you installed the "All" or "All Server" binary bundles, the gram-reporter package was installed for 
    you, since it was known at install time that you had both GRAM and MDS.  gram-reporter publishes jobmanager
    information into MDS.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To enable gram-reporter, you need to install the globus-gram-reporter
    package plus one jobmanager-specific setup package.&nbsp; You also need to
    edit the globus-job-manager.conf file to add the &quot;-publish-jobs&quot;
    and &quot;-job-reporting-dir&quot; options, as described in <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c-globus-2.2/globus_gram_job_manager/html/index.html">
    the GRAM jobmanager documentation</a>.&nbsp; The jobmanager will output
    status files to the -job-reporting-dir, which gram-reporter will read and
    publish into MDS.  </p>
  </li>

</ol>


<h2><a name="mds"></a>Configuring MDS</h2>


<p>Advanced configuration of MDS consists of the following tasks: </p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#anon">Deciding whether or not to allow anonymous access</a></li>
  <li><a href="#register">Configuring which GIISes a particular GRIS will report to</a></li>
  <li><a href="#policy">Configuring which GRISes a particular GIIS allows to report to it</a></li>
  <li><a href="#hierarchy">Configuring a hierarchical GIIS</a></li>
  <li><a href="#provider">Adding new information providers</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><a name="anon"></a><b>Deciding whether or not to allow anonymous access</b> <p>The file <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-slapd.conf</code>
    contains the lines which allow or disallow anonymous binding to the GRIS and GIIS. By
    default, it is configured to allow anonymous access to both. If you want non-anonymous
    access, you will need to acquire an LDAP certificate.</p>
    <p>The lines you need to change are the <code>anonymousbind</code> options. By default,
    they say <code>yes</code>. Change this to <code>no</code> to disable anonymous access. You
    will now need a separate authorization file called <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-mapfile</code>.
    It has the same syntax as the GRAM grid-mapfile, mapping from certificate subjects to
    usernames.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="register"></a><b>Configuring which GIISes a particular GRIS will report to</b> <p>The
    file <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-resource-register.conf</code> contains a list of
    registrations. Each entry specifies a GRIS with the &quot;reghn, regport&quot;
    information, and a GIIS for that GRIS to report into with the &quot;hn, port&quot;
    entries. The full syntax is listed in the <a href="guide-files.html">guide to
    configuration files</a>.</p>
    <p>By default, this file is configured to have the local GRIS report into the local GIIS.
    Be aware that a GIIS has a configuration file which tells it which registrations to
    accept. If you add reporting from a GRIS to a GIIS, you must also configure the GIIS to
    accept the registration from the GRIS.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="policy"><b>Configuring which GRISes a particular GIIS allows to report to it</b></a>
    <p>The file <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-site-policy.conf</code> controls the
    acceptance of registration messages by a GIIS. The default is for the GIIS to accept
    registrations only from itself, and from port 2135. This file must be modified from the
    default to accept outside GRISes, as well as in a hierarchical GIIS environment. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="hierarchy"><b>Configuring a hierarchical GIIS</b></a> <p>See the <a
    href="../mds/hierarchical_GIIS.pdf">Hierarchical GIIS</a> PDF for details. You will need to
    add a registration from your local GIIS to a remote GIIS, as well as configuring the
    remote GIIS to accept your registration.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="provider"><b>Adding an information provider</b></a> <p>The GRIS comes
    configured to provide information about basic machine resources, like memory, disk space,
    and networking. You may wish to have the GRIS provide some more application-specific
    information, or other information which your virtual organization decides to publish about
    its machines.</p>
    <p>See the MDS web pages for a discussion of how to <a
    href="../mds/GRISDiscussion.html">add a provider</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="gridftp"></a>Configuring Grid-FTP</h2>


<p>Advanced configuration of GridFTP consists of the following tasks:

<ol>
  <li><a name="tpt"></a><strong>Enabling third-party transfer</strong>    
    <p>Enabling third party transfers
    involved editing $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ftpaccess file to add the lines</p>
    <pre>
     	port-allow all 0.0.0.0/0
     	pasv-allow all 0.0.0.0/0
