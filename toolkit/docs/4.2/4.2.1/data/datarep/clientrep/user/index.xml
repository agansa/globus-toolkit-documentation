<chapter id="clientrep-user-usage"><title>Replicating data with the Replication Client</title>
    <para>This section describes a few key usage scenarios and provides examples of using the Replication Client command-line tools. The command-line client may be found at <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-replication-client</computeroutput>. For a complete list of options use the help option.</para>
    <screen>
% $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-replication-client --help
    </screen>
    <para>The client supports common data operations, such as put, get, copy, delete, and also register and replicate. The following examples assume that:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><simpara>an RLS is running on the local host using the default port (39281);</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>the local RLS catalg is updating the local RLS index service (OPTIONAL); and</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>a GridFTP Server is running on the local host using port 9001.</simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section><title>Put</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>put</emphasis> command takes a source file, either a local file (e.g., file://...) or a remote file (e.g., gsiftp://...), transfers it to a destination location, and registers it with a designated logical name.</para>
        <screen>
% echo &quot;FOO WAS HERE!&quot; > foo.orig
% $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-replication-client -r rls://localhost put \
 ./foo.orig foo gsiftp://hostname:9001/tmp/foo.put
        </screen>
    </section>

    <section><title>Get</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>get</emphasis> command looks up a replica using its logical name, randomly selects a replica source location, and gets the file to a local file location.</para>
        <screen>
% $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-replication-client -r rls://localhost get \
 foo ./foo.get
% cat ./foo.get
 FOO WAS HERE!
        </screen>
    </section>

    <section><title>Copy</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>copy</emphasis> command looks up a replica using its logical name, randomly selects a replica source location, and performs a thrid-party transfer to a remote location. It does not register the new copy in the RLS, hence the new remote file is called a copy not a replica.</para>
        <screen>
% $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-replication-client -r rls://localhost copy \
 foo gsiftp://hostname:9001/tmp/foo.copy
        </screen>
    </section>

    <section><title>Replicate</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>replicate</emphasis> command is nearly identical to the copy command, however, after the file is transfered to its new destination the files is registered in the RLS as another replica associated with the logical name.</para>
