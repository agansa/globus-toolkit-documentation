<para>The Data Replication Service (DRS) is provided with the Globus Toolkit &shortversion; and first appeared in the 
    GT 3.9.5 Beta release. The primary functionality of the component allows users to identify a set of desired files existing in their Grid environment, to make 
    local replicas of those data files by transferring files from one or more source locations, and to register the new replicas in a Replica Location Service. 
    The DRS conforms to the WS-RF specification and exposes a WS-Resource (called a "Replicator" resource) which represents the current state of the 
    requested replication activity and allows users to query or subscribe to various Resource Properties in order to monitor the state of the resource. The DRS 
    is built on the GT &shortversion; Java WS Core and uses the Globus RLS to locate and register replicas and the Globus RFT to transfer files.

<!-- [from cris] while coding howtos - i'm not sure where to code these 'actions' described in the overview:
 - finding where desired files are on the Grid
 - moving desired files to local storage
 - registering
 
 i'm sure the info is there, i'm just wondering how to make it clearer to end users how to do the above...
 
 also wonder if any of the following need to be doc'd for developers (i got this from design doc, iirc). in other words, is the current info enough for
 developers to figure out how to set all this up?
discovery phase
 - accessing delegated credential
 - querying local index for LRCs
 - invoking catalog filter class
 - querying each remote catalog for PFNs
 - using source selector class to select desired files
xfer phase
 - using RFT to create RFT resource, start xfer, access credentials, set up file xfers
 - using GridFTP server to perform xfer
 - using replicator to check status of RFT resource and get status
 register phase
 - adding mappings for new replicas to local catalog (using replicator)
 - LRC updating local and remote indexes to show new replicas
