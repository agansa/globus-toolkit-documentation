  <entry>"connection timeout" [fixme what does the actual error look like?]</entry>
  <entry>At times, a client may experience a connection timeout when interacting with the RLS server due to a variety of reasons:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>One reason could simply be due to wide-area network latency or congestion. </para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Another situation that users eventually encounter is due to scaling of the system. As the RLS server's database 
 of replica location mappings grows in size, some query operations, such as bulk queries involving large quantities of mappings 
 or wildcard queries that result in a large subset of mappings, will begin to take more time both to process the query and to return 
 the large results set to the client over the network.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></entry>
  <entry>
If timeouts are experienced with increasing frequency, increase the RLS server's timeout configuration parameter found in the 
<filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-rls-server.conf</filename> file. You may also use the <option>-t</option> timeout option of the 
   <olink targetdoc="rlsUser" targetptr="globus-rls-cli">globus-rls-cli</olink> tool.
