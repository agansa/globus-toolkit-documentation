  <title>Summary of Changes in RLS</title>

  <para>The following changes have occurred for RLS since the last stable
  release, <replaceable role="entity">previousversion</replaceable>:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>An embedded database (using SQLite) and ODBC libraries are now
      included in the RLS Server installation. A default installation of GT,
      will include a fully configured RLS Server that requires no database
      installation or configuration by the end user. Advanced users can still
      use their own database without changes.</simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>The RLS now includes a new Java client API written entirely in
      Java. It does not require the C client libraries and allows for Java
      client support on 64-bit platforms. The new API is fully backward
      compatible. Users need not make any changes to existing code to take
      advantage of the new library.</simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>The RLS Admin Guide has been completely rewritten to account
      for the embedded database support and to streamline the installation
      procedures. In addition, a large help section has been added based on an
      analysis of ODBC and database installation procedures and their
      compatibility with the RLS.</simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>Client tools support for bulk operations has been improved. The
      <computeroutput>globus-rls-cli</computeroutput> can now read input
      parameters from a file, and a new
      <computeroutput>globus-rls-bulk.sh</computeroutput> script also
      simplifies repetitive procedures involving bulk operations.</simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>Bug fixes up through the GT 4.0.6 release are also included in
      this release.</simpara>
