<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>
<para>The RLS provides a Client API for C and Java based clients. The RLS Client C API is provided in the form of a library (e.g., .so file). Any installation of RLS will include the shared library as part of the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/include</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</computeroutput> directories. The RLS Client Java API depends on the shared library, which it links to via the Java Native Interface (JNI).</para>
