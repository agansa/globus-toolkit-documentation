    <para>The RLS provides a Client API for C and Java based clients. The RLS Client C API is provided in the form of a library (e.g., .so file). Any installation of RLS will include the shared library as part of the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/include</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</computeroutput> directories. The RLS Client Java API depends on the the <computeroutput>commons-logging</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>cog-jglobus</computeroutput> libraries which typically located in the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/common</computeroutput> folder. The RLS Java Client jar is named <computeroutput>globus_rls_client.jar</computeroutput> and is typically installed in the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</computeroutput> folder.</para>
