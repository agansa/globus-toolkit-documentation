<para>The Replica Location Service (RLS) allows the registration and discovery of 
replicas. An RLS maintains and provides access to mapping information from 
    <glossterm baseform="logical name">logical names</glossterm> for data items to <glossterm baseform="target name">target names</glossterm>. These target names may represent 
physical locations of data items, or an entry in the RLS may map to another level of logical naming for the data item.</para>
