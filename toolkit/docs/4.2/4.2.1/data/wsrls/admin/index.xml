<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with WS RLS. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation.</para>

    <para>The WS RLS is a new component to be included with the GT 4.2 bundle in an upcoming release. It is not available in an existing bundle from the downloads section of the Globus Toolkit web site. Furthermore, changes to the toolkit (WS Core and WSAA)  made between the 4.0.x release and the latest code base, make the GT 4.0.x build environment unsuitable for GT 4.2 components. As such the WS RLS cannot be deployed on an existing GT 4.0.x installation. The good news, if you will, is that the WS RLS can use your existing GT 4.0.x RLS without modification. If you have an existing RLS installation, and you want to try out the WS RLS interface layer, you need not reinstall RLS. Of course, you may want to reinstall RLS exclusively for testing with the WS RLS interface, but it is up to your own choosing. The following instructions will guide you through the steps necessary to download and install the WS RLS from source.</para>

            <simpara>The WS RLS is an interface layer that depends on the RLS for the replica location functionality. You must install and run RLS and configure WS RLS to use the RLS via its JNDI configuration. Check that RLS is installed, running, and check that the WS RLS JNDI configuration uses the correct hostname and port to connect to the RLS.</simpara>
