<chapter id="wsrls-admin-installing" xreflabel="Building and installing WS RLS"><title>Building and Installing</title>

    <para>WS RLS is distributed with the Globus Toolkit <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> and is available in both the binary bundles and the source bundle. For most purposes, the binary bundle provides the simplest means of installing the WS RLS and its requirements. There are three typical ways to access and install the WS RLS:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><simpara><olink targetptr="wsrls-admin-install-binary"/></simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara><olink targetptr="wsrls-admin-install-source"/></simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara><olink targetptr="wsrls-admin-install-cvs"/></simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <important><simpara>Before proceding with installation of WS RLS, please familiarize yourself with the installation procedures for RLS (see <olink targetdoc="rls"/>).</simpara></important>

    <section id="wsrls-admin-install-binary"><title>Installing WS RLS using Globus Toolkit Binary Bundle</title>
        <para>Follow instructions provided by <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/> and <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" targetptr="gtadmin-install"/> in order to install the WS RLS from one of the available binary bundles of the Globus Toolkit.</para>
        <para>Once you have unpackaged the binary bundle, the following commands may be used to install WS RLS:</para>
        <screen>
% ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --enable-rls --enable-wsrls
% make
% make install
        </screen>
    </section>

    <section id="wsrls-admin-install-source"><title>Installing WS RLS using Globus Toolkit Source Bundle</title>
        <para>WS RLS is not installed as part of the default source install. In order to install WS RLS, you will need to ensure that RLS is also installed as part of the build by reviewing its installation procedures. Along with RLS configure settings (e.g., ODBC related settings) the <computeroutput>--enable-wsrls</computeroutput> flag is required as part of the configuration step.</para>
        <para>The following commands will install the WS RLS (optionally you may use the &quot;gt4-wsrls&quot; make target to build only WS RLS and its requirements:</para>
        <screen>
% ./configure --prefix=<emphasis>/path/to/install</emphasis> --enable-rls --enable-wsrls
% make <emphasis>[[rls] gt4-wsrls]</emphasis>
% make install
        </screen>
    </section>

    <section id="wsrls-admin-install-cvs"><title>Installing WS RLS using Globus CVS</title>
        <para>Additionally, you may access the WS RLS from the Globus Toolkit CVS repository. You may deploy the 4.1.x WS RLS on top of an existing GT 4.1.x installation using trunk.</para>
        <!-- Not sure this is true:
        <para>The following example instructions will only work given the presence of an existing GT installation with <emphasis>all WS RLS dependencies</emphasis>. The best way to establish such an environment is to first follow the basic installation instructions and subsequently use the following instructions to obtain the latest updates from the CVS branch.</para>
        -->
    <important><para>Please review <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/remote-cvs.html">Accessing the Globus Alliance's Code via CVS</ulink> for the authoratative information on building and installing the Globus Toolkit from source in our CVS.</para></important>
    <para>The following instructions may be used to build and install the WS RLS:</para>
    <screen>
setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages
cvs co packaging/
cd packaging
./make-packages.pl --bundles=gt4-wsrls --deps <emphasis>[--verbose]</emphasis>
setenv GPT_LOCATION /path/to/packaging/gpt-3.2globus2
$GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build <emphasis>[-verbose]</emphasis> ./bundle-output/custom-deps-1.0-src_bundle.tar.gz gcc32dbgpthr
        </screen>
        <note><simpara>Changes to the toolkit (WS Core and WSAA)  made between the 4.0.x release and the latest code base, make the GT 4.0.x build environment unsuitable for GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> components. As such the WS RLS cannot be deployed on an existing GT 4.0.x installation. The good news, if you will, is that the WS RLS can use your existing GT 4.0.x RLS without modification. If you have an existing RLS installation, and you want to try out the WS RLS interface layer, you need not reinstall RLS. Of course, you may want to reinstall RLS exclusively for testing with the WS RLS interface, but it is up to your own choosing.</simpara></note>
