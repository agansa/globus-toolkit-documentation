    <title>Limitations</title>
    <listitem>
        <simpara>At this time, WS RLS only supports a limited query response for WS-ReplicaLocationIndex (i.e., RLI) lookups. The RLS returns the URL for the LRC that contains the given Logical Name. In the WS RLS, it also returns a URL for the WS-ReplicaLocationCatalog. However, the URL can, at best, provide the scheme://domain:port information at this time due to restrictions imposed by the underlying RLS. This is sufficient for clients to reconstruct the full URL to the WS RLS based on the base URL. We expect to correct this issue in a near-term future release.</simpara>
