<para>The WS RLS is comprised of two WS-Resources, the ReplicaLocationCatalog and the ReplicaLocationIndex. Each WS-Resource defines ResourceProperties and a set of operations. The ReplicaLocationCatalog (or &quot;catalog&quot;) defines the set of operations for manipulating name mappings and associated attributes along with the standard query resource properties operation. The ReplicaLocationIndex (or &quot;index&quot;) specifies only the query resource properties operation since it is a read only inteface to the underlying index. Lifetime operations (<emphasis>set lifetime</emphasis> and <emphasis>destroy</emphasis>) do not apply to the WS RLS, because its WS-Resources live indefinitely. The resources are available so long as the service container is running and the WS RLS is deployed within the service container. Addressing the resources requires only the URL portion of the WS-Address.</para>
