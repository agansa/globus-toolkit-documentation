        <para>The WS RLS is a WS-RF compliant service implemented using the Globus Java WS Core. It
            exposes a set of Resource Properties and operations to allow users to create, add and
            remove mappings from logical names to target names, to define and undefine attribute
            definitions associated with names, and to create, modify and delete attributes
            associated with names. A custom query expression dialect is defined by the WS RLS which
            may be used to query the mapping and attributes represented by the Resource Properties
            of the service.</para>
