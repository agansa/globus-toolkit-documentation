<p><font color="purple">The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) is a WS-RF based 
service that provides interfaces for controlling and monitoring third party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfer is hosted
inside of a Grid service so it can be managed using the soft state model. It is 
essentially a reliable and recoverable version of the GT2 globus-url-copy tool 
and more.</font> </p>
