<para>We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve
    the RFT component.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable this feature, please see the "Usage Statistics Configuration" section of 
    <olink targetdoc="javawscoreAdmin" targetptr="javawscore-configuring"/> for instructions.</para>
    <para>Also, please see our <ulink url="../../../Usage_Stats.html">policy statement </ulink> on
