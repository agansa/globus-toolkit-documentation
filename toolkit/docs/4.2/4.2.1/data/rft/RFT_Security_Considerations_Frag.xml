<section><title>Permissions of service configuration files</title>
<para>

The service configuration files such as <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> or <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> 
(located under <computeroutput>etc/&lt;gar&gt;/</computeroutput> directory) contains private 
information such as database passwords and username. Ensure that these configuration 
files are only readable by the user that is running the container. </para>
<para>  The deployment process automatically sets the permissions of <computeroutput>
  jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> files as user 
  readable only. However, this might not work correctly on all platforms and
   this does not apply to any other configuration files. </para>

<section><title> Access of information stored in the database </title>
<para>
RFT stores the transfer request in a database. Proper security measures need to 
be taken to protect the access of the data by granting/revoking appropriate 
permissions on tables that are created for RFT use and other steps that are 
appropriate and consistent with site specific security measures.

<section><title>Permissions of persistent data</title>
<para>
RFT uses subscription persistence API from GT4 core to store all of its subscription data under the <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted</computeroutput> directory. Ensure that the entire <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted
</computeroutput> directory is only readable by the user running the container.
