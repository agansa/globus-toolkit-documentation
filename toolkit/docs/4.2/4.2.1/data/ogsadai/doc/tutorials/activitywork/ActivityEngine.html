<h1>Executing Activities in the Engine</h1>
<p>
This page gives an overview of the <span
class="important">engine</span> which is used by OGSA-DAI services to
execute Perform documents.

<p>Engine Architecture for Activities and Handlers</p>
</div>
<p>
The above figure shows the general structure created by the engine
when processing a Perform document (the components shown are limited
to those which are related to or impact upon implementation of
activities). The main points are:   
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For each activity in a Perform document, an
<span class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.ActivityHandler</span>
is created to manage that activity.   
</li>
<li>
For each output published by an activity, its handler constructs a
pipe for it to use. 
</li>
<li>
If a consumer requests a block from a pipe that has none, the pipe may
call back to the handler that created it to ensure that the producer
is running.
</li>
<li>
<span class="xml">deliverToResponse</span> activities are generated
and attached to any outputs that are not consumed within the request. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To illustrate this, the Perform document below
provides some hard-coded string data and passes that into a <span
class="xml">stringTokenizer</span>. No delivery is specified so
the results will be delivered back to the client in a synchronous
fashion:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;gridDataServicePerform xmlns="..."&gt;
  &lt;dataStore name="data"&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;my-data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;itemCursor name="cursor"/&gt;
  &lt;/dataStore&gt;
  &lt;stringTokenizer name="tokenizer"&gt;
    &lt;sourceString from="cursor"/&gt;
    &lt;tokens name="tokens"/&gt;
  &lt;/stringTokenizer&gt;
&lt;/gridDataServicePerform&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The Perform document above would result in a structure identical to
that shown in the foregoing figure. The following figure labels the
activities and their handlers with the types that would be used when
processing this Perform document.

<p>
The engine's responsibilities are split into four main areas: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Processing the Perform document to generate the structure shown in
the foregoing figures.  
</li>
<li>
Initiating execution of the activities (see <a href="#Execution">below</a>).
</li>
<li>
Monitoring the status of the activities within the Perform document
(see <a href="#StatusMonitoring">below</a>).
</li>
<li>
Returning a response to the client within a Response document.
</li>
</ol>
 
<h2 id="Execution">Execution</h2>
<p>
The way in which an engine executes a request is simple. All handlers
registered within a specific section of the context (<span
class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.EngineImpl.OUTPUTS</span>)
are told to initiate processing (a call is made to the  <span
class="java">processBlock()</span> method of the handler). This is the 
same way that a pipe causes its source to initiate processing, if
required. When using the default activity handlers, any activity that
does not publish any outputs will be a member of this set, and so will 
be executed directly by the engine. 
</p>
<p>
Activities that do publish outputs will only be executed when a
running activity requests a block from one of their outputs. At this
point, the pipe will call <span class="java">processBlock()</span> on
the associated activity handler to initiate processing.  
</p>
<p>
Execution ends when all activities have set their status to either 
<span class="java">ERROR</span> or <span
class="java">COMPLETE</span>. Once all of the activities in the output 
set have completed successfully, if other activities are still running
the engine will terminate the request to force those activities still
outstanding to finish.  
</p>
 
<h2 id="StatusMonitoring">Status Monitoring</h2>
<p>
This stage can occur either before or after a response is returned to
the client. If the client request is asynchronous in nature (i.e. the
results from the request are being delivered to a third party) then
the response is sent to the client once the engine has successfully 
completed execution of the request. The response seen by the client in
this case contains only the status of the activities in the request,
and will only contain additional data if there was an error prior to
execution of the request. 
</p>  
<p>
If the request is synchronous then the status of the activities is
monitored in the same way, but the engine will only return a response
to the client once the request has terminated, either successfully, or
because of an error condition. If the request completed successfully
then the data will be returned to the client within the response. If
the request failed then any data produced prior to the failure will be
discarded and only the error will be returned to the client. In the
case of an error, the first error to be reported is flagged by the
engine so that if it causes a cascade of errors the root cause is easy
to locate. 
</p>
<p>
Any status change reported by an activity is published via a 
<span class="important">RequestStatus</span> property.
