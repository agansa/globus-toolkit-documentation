    <title>Migrating from GT3</title>
    <para>The version of OGSA-DAI distributed with the Globus Toolkit 4.0.1 adds the new client toolkit libraries which were absent in the OGSA-DAI version distributed with 
    Globus Toolkit 4.0.0, as well as a number of other additions which brings the functionality close to that found in the previous OGSI versions of OGSA-DAI.</para>
    
    <para>The two remaining issues outstanding in this distribution are that message level security is not supported 'out of the box' and there is no support for concurrent 
    requests, due to the removal of the OGSI based Grid Data Service Factory. Both of these issues will be remedied in the next release.</para>
    
    <para>This release is suitable for evaluation and development of OGSA-DAI on the GT4.0.x platform, and the upgrade path to future releases for production systems 
    should be straightforward.</para>
