<para>  If you are running GT3.0.0 or greater, the migration for GridFTP is relatively painless.  There were only new 
    features added.  No changes were made to the existing protocol or APIs, so any existing client or application 
    built using our client APIs will work unchanged.  You may install new clients and servers on an “as 
    opportunity permits” basis and will have no problems.  Any combination of old/new client/server will work.</para>
    
    <para>To upgrade your server, either install it in a GLOBUS_LOCATION different than the GT3 installation (either as 
    part of an entire GT4 installation or by doing just make gridftp).  Alternately, you can statically link the new 
    server to avoid versioning issues and replace the existing executable.  The configuration files are very 
    different, so you will need to update the configuration.</para>
    
<para>    To upgrade your client, simply build the client and use the new client as you would the old one. </para>
    
    <para>Below is a list of new functionality available in GT3.2 and higher (note that the MLST/MLSD feature is used by 
    RFT in GT3.2 and higher and is required if you want to be able to specify a directory to move):</para>
