It allows you to browse the local file system, transfer files and directories between the local system and remote GridFTP servers and between two remote GridFTP servers (third-party transfers). It supports file system operations such as creating, deleting and renaming files and directories. It provides reliability by interfacing to the Globus Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service.
