    GridFTP GUI</ulink> is Java web start application. It provides an easy-to-use interface for connecting to GridFTP servers and transferring files. It allows you to browse the local file system, transfer files and directories between the local system and remote GridFTP servers and between two remote GridFTP servers (third-party transfers). It supports file system operations such as creating, deleting and renaming files and directories. It provides reliability by interfacing to the Globus Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service.

The GUI provides two ways for generating a proxy credential required for the data transfer:

2. Obtaining a proxy from a MyProxy Server. For more information about MyProxy, please visit: http://myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu/. 

    
NCSA, as part of their TeraGrid activity, produces a text based interactive client called UberFTP, which you may want to check out. See <olink targetptr="globus-url-copy-interactiveclients"/> for more information. </para>
