 <para>As of <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>, GridFTP provides system
  administration logs that are <ulink url="http://cedps.net/index.php/LoggingBestPractices">CEDPs
   best practices</ulink> compliant.</para><para>Configuration for this logger can be changed by

  <title>Configuring CEDPs Logging</title>
  <para>[the following is java core's info - tailor to own component]The specific logger to edit
   will be <computeroutput>log4j.logger.sysadmin</computeroutput> in <filename
    >container-log4j.properties</filename>. There you can configure the following properties:</para>
  <screen>log4j.appender.infoCategory=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.infoCategory.Threshold=INFO
log4j.appender.infoCategory.File=var/containerLog
log4j.appender.infoCategory.MaxFileSize=10MB
log4j.appender.infoCategory.MaxBackupIndex=2</screen>
  <para>Above implies the logging file is rolling with each file size limited to 10MB and the
   logging information is stored in <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/containerLog</filename>.</para>
  <section>
   <title>Sample log file</title>
   <para>The <ulink url="../sample-container-log.txt">sample log file</ulink> contains many log
    entries for various scenarios in the Java WS container [anything like this available for your
    component?].</para>
   <para>For more details on the CEDPS Logging format, including descriptions of reserved name-value
    pairs, see <ulink url="http://cedps.net/index.php/LoggingBestPractices"

 <!-- rachana will write notes on "how to write to cedps logging if you write services using Java WS Core"

1) all gt components need this frag

2) all java ws core based components will use java ws core method - others may use differently.

3) link to logging from debugging sections
> 
> 4. do people need to know where to find this info (like is it accessed 
> in a new way or new place)?
we write to a file in Java WS Core case and we need to tell people where that file is.
