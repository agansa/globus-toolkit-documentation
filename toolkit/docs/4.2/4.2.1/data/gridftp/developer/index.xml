  <indexterm><primary>architecture (GridFTP)</primary></indexterm>
  <para>GridFTP represents a service that a host is providing. Therefore, the service must be listening on a port waiting for 
    <glossterm linkend="client">client</glossterm> to request access to that service. 
    This is generally handled one of two ways:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Either an application daemon is running listening for connections, or </listitem>
   <listitem> inetd/xinetd is used. </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
<section>  <title>GridFTP Listening</title>
  <para>The following list describes the process between the service listening for connection and an exchange of data taking place:</para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>These services (application daemon or inetd/xinetd) listen for connections.</listitem>
    <listitem> When a connection is received on a “well known” port such as 2811 for GridFTP, inetd does a fork/exec to start up a GridFTP 
      <glossterm linkend="server">server</glossterm> process and then 
  does a Switch User (SU) so that the server is running in a user account rather than as root for security reasons. At this point, the client has 
      established a control channel to the server. </listitem>
  <listitem>The client will then send a series of commands to configure or describe the transfer that it wants to take place. </listitem>
  </orderedlist></section>
  <section><title>GridFTP Transfer</title>
  <para>There are basically four important components of the exchange:</para>
    <orderedlist>
  <listitem>The first is security. You must authenticate, and for GridFTP, you must establish encryption on the control channel. The control channel is 
    encrypted by default, though it can be switched off (see the security section for more detail). </listitem>
      <listitem>The second is setup and informational exchanges. The client may specify the type of the file (Binary or ASCII), the 
        <glossterm linkend="mode-command">MODE</glossterm> of the transfer, he might request the size of a file before transferring it, etc.. </listitem>
      <listitem>Third, the information and negotiation for the data channel must be done. How this is handled, depends on whether you are doing a 
        <glossterm linkend="client-server-transfer">client/server transfer</glossterm> or 
        <glossterm linkend="third-party-transfers">third party transfer</glossterm>.</listitem> 
  <listitem>Finally, a store (STOR), retrieve (RETR), extended store (ESTO) or extended retrieve (ERET) to indicate direction of the transfer and to start data moving.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
