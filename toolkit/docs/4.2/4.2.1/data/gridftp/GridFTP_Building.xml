  <para>GridFTP is built and installed as part of a default GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> installation. For
    basic installation instructions, see <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/>. No extra installation
    steps are required for this component.</para>

      <section id="gridftp-admin-installing-threaded"><title>Switching between threaded and non-threaded flavors</title>

<para>Starting with Globus 4.2.0, threaded flavor is the default flavor for the GridFTP server. 
  Non-threaded flavor is still the default flavor for the client. </para>
<section><title>If you are building from the source installer</title>
<para>If you are building from a source installer, both threaded and non-threaded flavors of server and client will be built by default. 
By default, the server executable in <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin</filename> is threaded 
  and the client executable in <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</filename> is non-threaded.</para>

<para>If you built from the source installer, you will find non-default flavors of both the server and client binaries in 
  <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/[flavor]/shared</filename> and <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/[flavor]/shared</filename>.  
  To use those flavors by default, simply copy those binaries to <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin or $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</filename>.</para>
<section>
<title>Examples</title>
<para>Changing <command>globus-url-copy</command> from non-threaded to threaded:
<screen>$ cp $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/gcc32dbgpthr/shared/globus-url-copy $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</screen></para>

<para>Changing <command>globus-gridftp-server</command> from threaded to non-threaded:
<screen>$ cp $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gcc32dbg/shared/globus-gridftp-server $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin</screen>
</para>
<para>Checking whether a binary is a threaded flavor or not with the tool <command>ldd</command> (no output means non-threaded):
<screen>$ ldd $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server |grep thread
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00cab000)</screen></para>
        </section>
</section>
<section><title>If you are building from the binary installer</title>
<para>If you are using a binary installer, it will only have a threaded GridFTP server and non-threaded client. 
If you want a different flavor of server/client, use source installer.</para>
