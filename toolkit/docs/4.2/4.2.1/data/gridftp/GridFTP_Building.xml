  <para>GridFTP is built and installed as part of a default GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> installation. For
    basic installation instructions, see <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/>. No extra installation
    steps are required for this component.</para>

      <section id="gridftp-admin-installing-threaded"><title>Building threaded flavors of GridFTP</title>
        
        <para>Threaded flavors of GridFTP are required for certain capabilities, such as using the UDT protocol or an HPSS driver. 
          To build a threaded flavor of the client, server, or SDK, you need to:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>use a source installer (<emphasis>not</emphasis> a binary installer).</para></listitem> 
          <listitem><para>add <option>-thr</option> to the <command>make</command> targets. </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        
        <note><para><option>-thr</option> is not relevant for the <command>gpt</command> target.</para></note>
        
        <para>For example, to build only the threaded GridFTP server, run:</para>
        
        <screen> globus$ make gpt globus_gridftp_server-thr</screen>
        
        <para>Both threaded and non-threaded flavors can be built at the same time. To do this, 
          include both of the targets in the <command>make</command> command. </para>
        
        <para>For example, to build the GridFTP
          server in both threaded and non-threaded flavors, run:</para>
        
        <screen>globus$ make gpt globus_gridftp_server globus_gridftp_server-thr</screen>
        
        <para>The flavor specified at the end would be the default. So, in the case above,
          the default GridFTP server is threaded.</para>
        
        <para>Target <option><olink targetdoc="gridftpAdmin" targetptr="gridftp-admin-installing-gridftp-only">gridftp</olink></option>, builds both the threaded and non-threaded 
          flavors of globus-data-management-sdk, but only the non-threaded flavor of the 
          server. </para>
        
        <para>In order to build the threaded flavor of the server as part of the package, run:</para>
        
        <screen>globus$ make gridftp globus_gridftp_server-thr</screen>
