<para>pyGridWare, the python WS Core, provides a basic python
  toolset for creating WSRF enabled web services, proven to interoperate with
  the Java WSRF. Performance
  is a primary concern and motivation. This WSRF
  project realizes a significant speedup by using C implementations at the performance
  critical security and DOM layers.</para>

<para>WSRF support includes WS-Resource Lifetime, WS-Resource
  Properties, and WS-Notification. Updated security
  support for WS-Secure Conversation and Secure Message is also included.</para>

<para>Client and service stubs have been generated from the most
  recent OASIS drafts and WS-Secure Conversation specification, but the bindings
  can be easily regenerated from WSDL via the setup script at install whenever
  WSDL needs to be updated.</para>
