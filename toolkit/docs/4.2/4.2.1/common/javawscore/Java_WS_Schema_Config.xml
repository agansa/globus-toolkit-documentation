        <title>Introducing Schema Based Configuration</title>
        <para>The configuration file for JNDI is functional.  It allows you to specify classes, and simple properties
        to set.  However, it is verbose, unclear, and does not support IDE completion.  The issue is that the configuration
        structure is so generic that it provides no semantic insight into what object is being created.  </para>
