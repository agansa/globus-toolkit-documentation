<h2>Permissions of service configuration files</h2>
<p>
The service configuration files such as <code>jndi-config.xml</code> or <code>server-config.wsdd</code> (located under <code>etc/&lt;gar&gt;/</code> directory) may contain private information such as database passwords, etc. Ensure that these configuration files are only readable by the user that is running the container. <br>
The deployment process automatically sets the permissions of <code>jndi-config.xml</code> and <code>server-config.wsdd</code> files as user readable only. However, this might not work correctly on all platforms and this does not apply to any other configuration files.
</p>

<h2>Permissions of persistent data</h2>
<p>
The services using subscription persistence API or other basic persistence helper API will store all or part of its persistent data under the <code>~/.globus/persisted</code> directory. Ensure that the entire <code>~/.globus/persisted</code> directory is only readable by the user running the container.
</p>

<h2>Invocation of non-public service functions</h2>
<p>
A client can potentially invoke a service function that is not formally defined in the WSDL but it is defined in the service implementation class. There are two ways to prevent this from happening:
<ol>
 <li>
   Define all service methods in your service class as either <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>.
 </li>
 <li>
  Configure appropriate <code>allowedMethods</code> or <code>allowedMethodsClass</code> parameter in the service deployment descriptor (please see the <a href="Java_WS_Core_Public_Interfaces.html#config">configuration interface</a> for details).
 </li>
</ol>
</p>
