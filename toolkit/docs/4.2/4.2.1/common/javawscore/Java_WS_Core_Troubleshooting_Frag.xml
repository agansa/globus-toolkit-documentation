	In general, if you want to investigate a problem on your own please see the <ulink url="../../common/javawscore/developer-index.html#s-javawscore-developer-debugging">Debugging and Logging</ulink> section for details on how to turn on debugging. Also, please note that most of the command line clients have <parameter>-debug</parameter> option that will display more detailed error messages including the error stack traces. Also, <ulink url="http://www-fp.globus.org/about/email-archive-search.html">searching the mailing lists</ulink> such as <ulink url="mailto:discuss@globus.org">discuss@globus.org</ulink> or <ulink url="mailto:developer-discuss@globus.org">developer-discuss@globus.org</ulink> (before posting a message) can also be very fruitful. Finally, if you think you have found a bug please report it in our <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</ulink> system.
