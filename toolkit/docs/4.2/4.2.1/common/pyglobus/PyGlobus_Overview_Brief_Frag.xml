<para> pyGlobus provides a high-level, object-oriented interface to the Globus Toolkit 2(r) libraries and related packages such as MyProxy. pyGlobus includes a series of modules that provide access to the full functionality of the Pre-WS API while hiding much of the complexity. In addition, a number of servers and command line tools are provided, e.g., a GridFTP server, a GridFTP GUI client, pyglobusrun, and pyglobus-url-copy. pyGlobus supports the rapid development of Pre-WS applications, and allows for easy integration with C/C++ and Fortran code. </para>
