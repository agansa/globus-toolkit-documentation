<section id="pyglobus-security-considerations"><title>Security Considerations for PyGlobus</title>
<para>pyGlobus has a security module which allows for proxy creation, signing, encryption, 
    and the creation and inquiry of security contexts. Care must be taken when developing 
    applications which use GSI to ensure that authentication information will not be compromised. 
    When creating a security context, one must ensure that the context will have the properties that 
    they desire. For example, should the context use confidentiality or integrity? These concerns 
    are not specific to pyGlobus but rather to any application developer who is using low level security APIs.</para>
