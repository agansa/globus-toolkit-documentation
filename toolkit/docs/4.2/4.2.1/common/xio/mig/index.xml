    <title>Migrating XIO from GT2</title>
    <para>Globus XIO is a new component as of Globus 3.2. Previous versions of Globus provided an
      API called <computeroutput>globus_io</computeroutput>. XIO is a replacement for
        <computeroutput>globus_io</computeroutput>; however, a compatibility layer exists to allow
      full backward compatibility for applications written against globus_io. For users familiar
      with globus_io the learning curve for XIO will be very small. The APIs use the same event
      model and only significantly differ in connection establishment. </para>

  <section id="xio-migrating-GT3">
    <title>Migrating XIO from GT3</title>
    <para>Globus XIO has made very few changes in the API since its introduction. User of GT
        <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> who are previously familiar with globus_xio
      will notice no difference. </para>
