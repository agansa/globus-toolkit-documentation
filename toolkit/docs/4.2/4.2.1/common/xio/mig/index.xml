  <para>The following provides information about migrating from previous versions of the Globus
  Toolkit.</para>

    <title>Migrating XIO from GT4.0.x</title>
    <para>The only significant change to Globus XIO in this release is the 
          addition of "string attributes".  The previous method of handling
          attributes still works in an entirely backward compatible way,
          but the string attributes adds a much needed convenience. Drivers
          can now provide a list of key=value pairs.  A user can then
          specify these options at the command line and at run time.  This
          make run time configuration much more flexible.
        <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> No other differences 
       will be noticed by those previously familiar with globus_xio.

  <section id="xio-migrating-GT3">
    <title>Migrating XIO from GT3</title>
    <para>Globus XIO has made very few changes in the API since its introduction. Users of GT
        <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> who are previously familiar with globus_xio
      will notice no difference. </para>

  <section id="xio-migrating-GT2">
    <title>Migrating XIO from GT2</title>
    <para>Globus XIO is a new component as of Globus 3.2. Previous versions of Globus provided an
      API called <computeroutput>globus_io</computeroutput>. XIO is a replacement for
        <computeroutput>globus_io</computeroutput>; however, a compatibility layer exists to allow
      full backward compatibility for applications written against globus_io. For users familiar
      with globus_io the learning curve for XIO will be very small. The APIs use the same event
      model and only significantly differ in connection establishment. </para>
