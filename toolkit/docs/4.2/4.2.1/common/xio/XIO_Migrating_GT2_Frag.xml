<para>Globus XIO is a new compontent as of Globus 3.2.  Previous versions
        of Globus provided an API called globus_io.  
        XIO is a replacement for globus_io, 
        however a compatibility layer exists to allow full backward
       compatibility to application writen against globus_io.  For users
        familiar with globus_io, the learning curve for XIO will be very
        small.  The APIs use the same event model and only significantly
        differ in connection esstablishment.
