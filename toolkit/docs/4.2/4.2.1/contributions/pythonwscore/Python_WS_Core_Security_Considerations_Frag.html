<p>Individual services can be configured with or without message security, but transport
  security is a characteristic of the entire container (either use ssl or plain
  tcp). Authentication and authorization of clients is performed using a callback
  mechanism. </p>
<h3>Transport Security</h3>
<p>Simply edit the file <code>config.txt</code> where the executable is being
  run and turn on ssl. </p>
<p>By default, pyGridWare will look in the user's home directory
  for the <code>.globus/usercert.pem</code> and <code>.globus/userkey.pem</code> files.</p>
<p> To use the grid proxy generated by <code>grid-proxy-init</code>, just specify
  the <code>/tmp/x509***</code> as
    the certfile and keyfile. </p>
<p> <b>Example pyGridWare/bin/config.txt</b></p>
<pre>  [security]
  ssl = 1
  certfile =
  keyfile = </pre>
