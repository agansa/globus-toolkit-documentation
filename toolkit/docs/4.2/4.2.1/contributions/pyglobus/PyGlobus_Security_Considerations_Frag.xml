<para> pyGlobus has a security module which allows for proxy creation, signing, encryption,
  the creation and inquiry of security contexts. Care must be taken when developing
  applications which use GSI to ensure that authentication information will not
  be compromised. When creating a security context, one must ensure that the
  context will have the properties that they desire. For example should the context
  use confidentiality of integrity? These concerns are not specific to pyGlobus
  but rather to any application developer who is using low level security APIs. </para>
