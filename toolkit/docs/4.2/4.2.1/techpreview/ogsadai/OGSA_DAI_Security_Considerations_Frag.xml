<para>OGSA-DAI does not provide any security over and above that already provided by the Globus Toolkit. 
    However, consideration must be given to the role mapping which converts a grid credential to a database 
    username/password. OGSA-DAI comes with two basic role mappers: a simple role mapper which accesses 
    a plain text file with this information and one which encrypts the username/password information. More details 
    can be found in the documentation bundled with the documentation. If neither of these schemes are secure 
    enough then it is possible to replace it by implementing a new role mapper interface.</para>
