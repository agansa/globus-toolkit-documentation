<section id="s-sgas-admin-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with [component]. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installing, configuring,
 deploying, and testing the installation.</para>
 <important>
  <simpara> This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
   overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <ulink url="../../admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink>.

<section id="s-sgas-admin-installing"><title>Building and installing</title>
 <para>Building from source is only needed if you need to modify or test the source code for some reason. 
  If not, you can proceed to the installation section.</para>
 <para>The source code is available in the same installer tar ball as the binaries, in the file sgas-4.0.1-src.tar.gz. 
  To build from source, extract the files in that tar ball and run the make-dist script contained therein.</para>
 <para>Source code is available via AFS. To retrieve the latest code set your CVSROOT environment variable to: 
  /afs/pdc.kth.se/src/packages/SweGrid/SourceRepository. Then export the code by running the following command:</para>
 <screen>cvs export -D today accounting</screen>
 <para>If you don't have access to AFS you can also download a nightly checkout of the code from 
  <ulink url="http://www.sgas.se/source/">http://www.sgas.se/source/</ulink>.</para>

<section id="s-sgas-admin-configuring"><title>Configuring </title>
<para>This information is in addition to the basic configuration instructions in the 
 <ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/admin/docbook/">GT4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink>.</para>
 <para>The accounting system is an orthogonal component that complements an installation of (in particular) GRAM. 
  Integration with WS GRAM is ongoing and not included in this tech preview.</para>
 <para>At this point in time, detailed deployment and configuration information can be found at

<section id="s-sgas-admin-testing"><title>Testing</title>
 <para>A test suite for an SGAS installation is provided. To use it run:</para>
 <screen>build.sh run-test</screen>
 <para>after you have installed the system. </para>
  <para>On Windows systems, use the <command>build.bat</command> 
  script instead of <command>build.sh</command>.</para>

 <para>Detailed error messages, such as stack traces are not logged to the command line utility (<command>sgas-admin</command>) 
  output but instead are written to an error log file. The default location of this file is <filename>./sgas-admin.log</filename>. 
  The location and other SGAS admin log properties can be changed in the file 
  <filename>etc/sgas-client/sgas-admin-log4j.properties</filename> in the 
  SGAS installation directory. The errors displayed in the command line tool share the same correlation id (CID) 
  as the errors in the error log file.</para>
 <para>If you encounter problems or need assistance, don't hesitate to send an email to [where?]</para>
