<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information
  for system administrators working with GRAM4. It provides references to
  information on procedures typically performed by system administrators,
  including installation, configuring, deploying, and testing the
  installation. It also describes additional prerequisites and host settings
  necessary for GRAM4 operation. Readers should be familiar with the
  <olink targetdoc="executionKey">Key Concepts</olink> and
  <olink targetdoc="executionKey" targetptr="execution-approach">Implementation Approach</olink>
  for GRAM4 to understand the motivation for and interaction between the
  various deployed components.

    <simpara> The information in this GRAM4 Admin Guide is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
   overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" />.

<!-- introduction -->

<chapter id="gram4-admin-installing"><title>Building and Installing</title>
  <para>GRAM4 is built and installed as part of
    a default GT &shortversion; installation. For basic installation instructions, see   <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/>.</para>
  
  <section id="gram4-admin-installing-req" xreflabel="Prerequisites for installing GRAM4"><title>Prerequisites</title>

<!-- transport level security -->
<section id="gram4-admin-security"><title>Transport Level Security (TLS)</title>
<para>
  In order to use GRAM4, the container must be started with Transport Level
  security.  The "-nosec" option should *not* be used with
  <computeroutput>globus-start-container</computeroutput>.
</para>
</section>

<!-- sudo -->
<section id="gram4-admin-sudo"><title>Functioning sudo</title> <para>
  GRAM4 requires that the <glossterm baseform="superuser do">sudo</glossterm> command is
  installed and functioning on the service host where GRAM4 software will
  execute.
</para>
<para>
  Authorization rules will need to be added to the
  <computeroutput>sudoers</computeroutput> file to allow the GRAM4 service
  account to execute (without a password) the <glossterm>scheduler adapter</glossterm> in the
  accounts of authorized GRAM users.  For sudo configuration details, see the
    <olink targetptr="gram4-admin-configuring">Configuring</olink> section.
</para>
<para>
   Platform Note: On AIX, sudo is not installed by default, but it is available as source and rpm here: 
  <ulink url="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/download.html">AIX 5L Toolbox for Linux Applications</ulink>
</para>
</section>

<!-- local scheduler -->
<section id="gram4-admin-localscheduler"><title>Local Scheduler</title>
<para> 
  GRAM4 depends on a local mechanism for starting and controlling jobs.
  Included in the GRAM4 software is a Fork <glossterm>scheduler</glossterm>, which requires no
  special software installed to execute jobs on the local host.  However, to
  enable GRAM4 to execute and manage jobs to a <glossterm>batch scheduler</glossterm>, the scheduler
  software must be installed and configured prior to configuring GRAM4.
</para>
</section>

<!-- scheduler adapters -->
<section id="gram4-admin-schedulerAdpaters"><title>Scheduler Adapter</title>
  <para>  GRAM4 depends on scheduler adapters to translate the GRAM4 <glossterm>job description</glossterm>
  document into commands understood by the local scheduler, as well as monitor
  the jobs.</para>
  <para>
      Scheduler adapters included in the GT &shortversion; release are:
  <ulink url="http://www.openpbs.org/">PBS</ulink>,
  <ulink url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</ulink>,
  <ulink url="http://www.platform.com/Products/Platform.LSF.Family/Platform.LSF/">LSF</ulink>
  </para>

  <para>
      Third party schedulers adapters available for GT &shortversion; are: <ulink url="http://www.lesc.ic.ac.uk/projects/SGE-GT4.html">Sun Grid Engine</ulink>
  </para>

  <para>
      For configuration details, see "Configuring scheduler adapters" in the
  <olink targetptr="gram4-admin-configuring">Configuring</olink> section.
  </para>

</section>

<!-- GridFTP -->
<section id="gram4-admin-gridftp"><title>GridFTP</title>
<para> 
  Though staging directives are processed by RFT (see next section), RFT
  uses GridFTP servers underneath to do the actual data movement. As a
  result, <emphasis>there must be at least one GridFTP server that shares a
  file system with the execution nodes</emphasis>.  There is no special process
  to get staged files onto the execution node before the job executable is run.

  See the "Non-default GridFTP server" section of <olink targetptr="gram4-admin-configuring"/> for details on how to configure GRAM4 for your
  GridFTP servers used in your execution environment.
</para>
</section>

<!-- RFT -->
<section id="gram4-admin-rft"><title>Reliable File Transfer Service (RFT)</title>
<para> 
  GRAM4 depends on RFT to perform file staging and cleanup directives in 
  a job description.  For configuration details, see <olink targetdoc="rftAdmin"/>.

  <emphasis>Important:</emphasis> Jobs requesting these functions will fail if
  RFT is not properly setup.
</para>
</section>

<!-- Persistency Database -->
<section id="gram4-admin-persistency"><title>Database for Persistency Data</title>
  <para>
    WS-GRAM stores information about job resources in a relational database system
    to ensure that no information about running jobs is lost in case of a container
    shutdown and restart. The default database system is Derby; the necessary database is
    created during installation of the GT. Database schemas for MySQL and
    PostgreSQL are provided too.

<chapter id="gram4-admin-deploying"><title>Deploying </title>
  <para>GRAM4 is deployed as part of a standard toolkit installation. 
    Please refer to  the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/> for details.</para>

<section id="gram4-admin-deploying-tomcat"><title>Deploying in Tomcat</title>
  <para>GRAM4 has been tested to work without any additional setup steps
when deployed into Tomcat.  Please see <olink targetdoc="javawscoreAdmin" targetptr="javawscore-admin-tomcat-deploying"/> for
instructions.  Also, for details on tested containers, see the
<olink targetdoc="gram4RN" targetptr="gram4-rn-testedplatforms"/>.</para>
<note><simpara>Currently only a single deployment is supported because of a
limitation in the execution of the Scheduler Event Generator.  One must set
GLOBUS_LOCATION before starting Tomcat.</simpara></note>
