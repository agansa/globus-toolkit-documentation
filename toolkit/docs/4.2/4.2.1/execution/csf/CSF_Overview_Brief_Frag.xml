<para>The Community Scheduler Framework <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> (CSF<replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>) is a WSRF-compliant 
    Grid level meta-scheduling framework built upon the Globus&reg; Toolkit.

    reservations and define different scheduling policies at the Grid level. Using CSF, 
    Grid users are able to access different resource managers, such as LSF, PBS,
