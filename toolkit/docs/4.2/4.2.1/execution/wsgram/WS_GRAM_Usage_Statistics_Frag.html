The following usage statistics are sent by default in a UDP packet (in addition
to the GRAM component code, packet version, timestamp, and source IP address)
at the end of each job (i.e. when Done or Failed state is entered).</p>
<ul>
    <li>job creation timestamp
        (helps determine the rate at which jobs are submitted)</li>
    <li>scheduler type
        (Fork, PBS, LSF, Condor, etc...)</li>
    <li>jobCredentialEndpoint present in RSL flag
        (to determine if server-side user proxies are being used)</li>
    <li>fileStageIn present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the staging in of files is used)</li>
    <li>fileStageOut present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the staging out of files is used)</li>
    <li>fileCleanUp present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the cleaning up of files is used)</li>
    <li>CleanUp-Hold requested flag
        (to determine if streaming is being used)</li>
    <li>job type
        (Single, Multiple, MPI, or Condor)</li>
    <li>gt2 error code if job failed
        (to determine common scheduler script errors users experience)</li>
    <li>fault class name if job failed
        (to determine general classes of common faults users experience)</li>
</ul>
