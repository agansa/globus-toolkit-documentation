<h3>Enabling debug logging for GRAM classes</h3>
<p>
For starters, consult the
<a href="../../../common/javawscore/developer/#debugging">Debugging section of
the Java WS Core Developer's Guide</a> for details about what files to edit and
other general log4j configuration information.
</p>
<p>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Executable Job Service (MEJS), add the
following entry to the <code>container-log4j.properties</code> file:
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.exec=DEBUG
</pre>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Multi Job Service (MMJS), add the
following entry to the <code>container-log4j.properties</code> file:
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.multi=DEBUG
</pre>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Job Factory Service (MJFS), add the
following entry to the <code>container-log4j.properties</code> file:
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.factory=DEBUG
</pre>
To turn on debug logging for all GRAM code, add the following entry to the
<code>container-log4j.properties</code> file:
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec=DEBUG
</pre>
Follow the pattern to turn on logging for other specifc packages or classes.
</p>
<h3>Debugging script execution</h3>
<p>
It may be neccessary to debug the scheduler scripts if jobs aren't being
submitted correctly, and either no fault or a less-than-helpful fault is
generated.  Ideally we would like that this not be neccessary; so if you find
that you must resort to this, please file a bug report or let us know on the
discuss e-mail list.
</p>
<p>
By turning on debug logging for the MEJS (see above), you should be able to
search for <b>"Perl Job Description"</b> in the logging output to find the perl
form of the job description that is sent to the scheduler scripts.
</p>
<p>
Also by turning on debug logging for the MEJS, you should be able to search for
<b>"Executing command"</b> in the logging output to find the specific commands
that are executed when the scheduler scripts are invoked from the service code.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the above advice, you may want to edit the perl scripts themselves to
print more detailed information like the native scheduler job description. For
more information on the location and composition of the scheduler scripts,
please consult the <a href="./scheduler-tutorial-perl.html">WS-GRAM
Scheduler Interface Tutorial</a>.
