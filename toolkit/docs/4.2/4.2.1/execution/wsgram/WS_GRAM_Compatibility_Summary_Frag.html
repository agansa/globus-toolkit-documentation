<p>Protocol changes since GT version 3.2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The protocol has been changed to be WSRF compliant.  There is no backward compatibility between this version and any previous versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>API changes since GT version 3.2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The MJFS <code>create()</code> operation has become
    <code>createManagedJob()</code> and, now provides the option to send a
    <strong>uuid</strong>. A client can use this uuid to recover a job handle
    in the event that the reply message is not received. Given this new method,
    the <code>start()</code> operation can be removed. This operation also
    allows a notification subscription to specified. Without the
    <code>start()</code> operation, this is the only way to reliably get all
    job state notifications.</li>
  <li>The MJS <code>start()</code> operation has been removed.  Its purpose was
    to ensure that the client had recieved the job handle prior to the job being
    submitted (and thus consuming resources), and is redundant with the uuid functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schema changes since GT version 3.2. See the <a href="user/">4.0 User's Guide</a> for
  more information about the new RSL syntax:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Executable is now a single local
        file path. Remote URLs are no longer allowed. If executable staging is
    desired, it should be added to the fileStageIn directive.</li>
  <li>stdin is now a single local file path. Remote URLs are no longer allowed.
    If stdin staging is desired, it should be added to the fileStageIn directive.</li>
  <li>stdout
        is now a single local file path, instead of a list of remote URLs. If
    stdout staging is desired, it should be added to the fileStageOut directive.</li>
  <li>stderr
        is now a single local file path, instead of a list of remote URLs. If
    stderr staging is desired, it should be added to the fileStageOut directive.</li>
  <li>scratch_directory
        has been removed.</li>
  <li>GramMyJobType has been removed. &quot;Collective&quot; functionality
    is always available if a job chooses to use it.</li>
  <li>File Staging related RSL
      attributes have been replaced with RFT file stransfer attributes/syntax.</li>
  <li>RSL
        substitution definitions and substitution references have been removed
    in order to be able to use standard XML parsing/serialization tools.</li>
  <li>RSL variables
        have been added. These are keywords denoted in the form of ${variable
    name} that can be found in certain RSL attributes.</li>
  <li>Explicit credential references
        have added, which, along with use of the new DelegationFactory service,
    replace the old implicit delegation model.</li>
</ul>
