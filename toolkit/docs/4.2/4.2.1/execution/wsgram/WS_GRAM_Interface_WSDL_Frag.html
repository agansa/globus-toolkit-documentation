<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p> WS-GRAM allows for remote execution and management of programs through the
creation of a managed job. The management of the job is taken care of
primarily by core toolkit functionality (WS-ResourceLifetime and WS-BaseN
implementations).  Please see the <a href="../../common/javawscore/index.html">Java
WS Core documentation</a> on notifications
  and resource lifetime (destruction) for more information.</p>

<h4>Managed Job Factory Service (MJFS)</h4>
<p>  A single MJFS is used to create all jobs for all users. For each local
  resource manager, a dedicated Managed Job Factory Resource (MJFR)
  enables the MJFS to publish information about the characteristics of the
  compute resource, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>host information</li>
  <li>GridFTP URL (for file staging and streaming)</li>
  <li>compute cluster size and configuration, and so on... </li>
</ul>

In addition, there is a special MJFR which is used for creating MMJRs.

<h4>Managed Executable Job Service (MEJS)</h4>
<p>  A single MEJS is used to manage all executable jobs for all users.
  Each Managed Executable Job Resource (MEJR) enables the MEJS to publish
  information about the individual job the MEJR represents. This information
  can be accessed by querying the MEJS for the resource properties of
  a given MEJR, such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  current job state</li>
  <li>  stdout location</li>
  <li>  stderr location</li>
  <li>  exit code, and so on. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Managed Multi-Job Service (MMJS)</h4>
<p>  A single MMJS is used to manage all multi-jobs for all users.
  Each Managed Multi-Job Resource (MMJR) enables the MMJS to publish
  information about the individual multi-job the MMJR represents. This
  information can be accessed by querying the MMJS for the resource properties
  of a given MMJR, such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>current overall job state</li>
  <li>list of sub-job EPRs</li>
  <!--
  <li>stdout location</li>
  <li>stderr location</li>
  -->
</ul>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>There are just two operations defined in the GRAM port types (not counting
the Rendezvous port type which is used for MPI job synchronization):
"createManagedJob" in the Managed Job Factory port type, and "release" in the
Managed Job port type. All other operations (such as canceling/killing the job
and querying for resource properties) are provided by the underlying WSRF
implementation of the toolkit.</p>

<h4>ManagedJobFactoryPortType</h4>

<pre>createManagedJob</pre>

<p>The input of this operation consists of a job description, an optional
initial termination time for the job resource, and an optional state
notification subscription request. This operation creates either a MEJR or MMJR,
subscribes the client for notifications if requested, and replies with one or
two endpoint references (EPRs).</p>
The first EPR:
<ul>
    <li>is qualified with the identifier to the newly created MEJR or MMJR</li>
    <li>points to either the MEJS or MMJS.</li>
</ul>
The second EPR:
<ul>
    <li>is only present if a notification subscription was requested</li>
    <li>is qualified with the identifier to the newly created subscription
        resource</li>
    <li>points to the subscription manager service.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that using the optional subscription request is the only
 way to guarantee that all notification messages will reach the client.</p>

<p>The ManagedJobFactoryPortType also has all the operations
  and publishes all the resource properties (via the MJFR)
defined in the following <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-resource/ws-resourceproperties.pdf" target="_blank">WS-ResourceProperties</a> port types:</p> <ul>   <li> GetResourceProperty</li>   <li> GetMultipleResourceProperties</li>   <li> QueryResourceProperties</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red">[Update WSDL link to the version in GT 3.9.3.]</font></p>

<h4>ManagedJobPortType</h4>

<pre>release</pre>

<p>This operation takes no parameters and returns nothing. It's purpose is to
release a hold placed on a state through the use of the "holdState" field in the
job description. See the domain-specific WS-GRAM component documentation for
more information on the "holdState" field.</p>
