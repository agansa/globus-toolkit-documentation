<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </para>

  We need volunteers to exercise CAS to discover performance and
  scalability problems as well as volunteers to closely inspect CAS
  from a security perspective. Since CAS serves as a central point 
  for a VO's authorization decisions security and scalability issues 
  are extremely important to discover early. 
 </simpara></listitem>
 <listitem><simpara>
  We need volunteers for CAS to discover functionality and usability
  problems. Improving usability and functionality will make the
  software easier to use and develop with.
