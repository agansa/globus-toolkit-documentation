<para>Globus Teleoperations Control Protocol (GTCP) is a service interface for telecontrol.  It is the
WSRF version of the NEESgrid Teleoperations Control Protocol (NTCP),
which is used to control heterogeneous physical and computational
simulations coupled in geographically-distributed earthquake
engineering experiments. It has also been used to control data
acquisition systems (triggering the collection of data) and
high-resolution cameras (triggering image acquisition) during
earthquake engineering experiments, and, to a lesser extent, to
control the positioning, focal length, etc. of electron microscopes
in a neuroscience application.
GTCP exposes two interfaces:  
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>a WSRF-compliant
service interface used by clients to control remote instruments and simulations,</simpara></listitem>

<listitem><simpara>and a "plugin" interface to facilitate integrating new back ends (physical
or computational simulation platforms) to the GTCP server.  </simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
The plugin
interface is a Java interface definition that includes methods for
each platform-specific action; a new platform is integrated by writing
a class that implements this interface definition</para>
