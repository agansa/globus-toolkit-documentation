<para>[FIXME]The workspace service allows clients to dynamically bind credentials to Unix accounts.
If the service clients were not properly authorized, arbitrary credentials could be mapped to accounts with all of the security problems that could entail.  
The authorization documentation should be understood and followed to ensure only authorized clients can create or manage workspaces.</para>

<para>Each workspace implementation (the back ends) could potentially allow elevated access to a local attacker if the permissions on the 
executable are not set properly.  Each particular back end's installation notes should be clearly understood and followed, to ensure the 
proper system permissions are set and the principle of least privilege is maintained.</para>
