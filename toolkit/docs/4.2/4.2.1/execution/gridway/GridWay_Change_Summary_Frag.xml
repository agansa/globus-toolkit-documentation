  <title>Summary of Changes in GridWay</title>

  <para>GridWay version shipped with GT4.2.1 is based on GridWay 5.4, a new stable version with increased functionality, including support to access the NorduGrid infrastructure, new bindings for DRMAA and support for DAGMAN workflows.</para>

  <para>New to 4.2.1:</para>

      <term>Integration with major Grid Infrastructures</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Following the trend from previous releases, GridWay is
        capable of integrate with another major infrastructure: NorduGrid.
        Drivers for Execution and Transfer are included in this
        release.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>New DRMAA bindings for scripting languages</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Previous GridWay releases come with support for C and Java
        bindings implementing the DRMAA standard. Scripting languages are
        interesting from the point of view of rapid application prototyping
        among others. From dsa-research.org we believe this to be an
        interesting aspect, and that is why GridWay includes bindings to
        access the DRMAA standard from scripting languages such as Perl, Ruby
        and Python.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Support for DAGMAN workflows</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>There is an increasing interest from the scientific community to
        be able to run complex workflows on a Grid environment. An almost
        de-facto standard to represent DAG workflows is Condor DAGMAN. In this
        development release GridWay includes a new workflow launcher (gwdag)
        that handles this kind of workflows.</para>
