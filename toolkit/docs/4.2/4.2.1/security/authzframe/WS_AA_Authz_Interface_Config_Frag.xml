  <para>The authorization framework can be configured at the resource, service
or container level.  Configuration settings are specified  in security descriptors. The descriptors can be
read  from a file or can be created programmatically. Refer to <xref linkend="p-client-sec-desc-config"/> for
more details.</para>
  <para>Authorization configuration involves setting a chain of
authorization schemes (also known as Policy Decision Points (PDPs)). When a authorization decision needs to be made the PDPs in the chain are evaluated in turn to arrive at a permit or deny decision. The combining rule for results from the individual PDPs is currently &quot;deny overrides&quot;; that is, all PDPs have to evaluate to permit for the chain to evaluate as permit. </para>
