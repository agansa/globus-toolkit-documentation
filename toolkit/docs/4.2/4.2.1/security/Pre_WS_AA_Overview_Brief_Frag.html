The Globus Toolkit pre-Web Services authorization callouts enable the
ability to perform access control based on the client credentials
(i.e. the X.509 certificate chain), customize gridmap lookup
(currently available in the Gatekeeper and GridFTP servers), and
performing fine-grained authorization in the GRAM Jobmanager.
