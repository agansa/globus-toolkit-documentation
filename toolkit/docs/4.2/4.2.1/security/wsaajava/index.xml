        <title>Overview</title>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">GT4&rsquo;s Java WS security</emphasis>: As mentioned above,
            there are three main aspects to Java WS Security: authentication, message protection and
            authorization. Authentication and message protection are tightly coupled: authentication
            establishes that the remote entity is who he claims to be and then, using the keys, the
            message sent is secured. Toolkit supports two types of mechanisms to achieve this: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <simpara>
                        <olink targetdoc="message">Message-level Security</olink> mechanisms, which
                        implement the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation specification
                        to provide message protection for GT4&rsquo;s SOAP messages</simpara>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <simpara>
                        <olink targetdoc="message">Transport-level Security</olink> mechanisms, which
                        use transport-level security (TLS) mechanisms</simpara>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>In all mechanisms supported in the toolkit, integrity and privacy protection mechanisms
            are supported, with integrity being the default level of protection. Also, the
            authentication is mutual in all cases, that is, the server authenticates the client and the
            client authenticates the server.</para>
        <para>Once authentication is complete, the peer identity is established and the next step is
            authorization. Authorization happens after authentication (and in some cases once a secure
            message is received), where you establish whether the remote entity can perform the action
            that is being requested. An <olink targetdoc="authzframe">Authorization Framework</olink>
            provides this functionality on the server and client side. On the server side, a framework
            that allows for a variety of authorization schemes, including a
            &ldquo;grid-mapfile&rdquo; access control list, an access control list defined by a
            service, a custom authorization handler, and access to an authorization service via the SAML
            protocol, is used to accomplish this. On the client side, similar, but a subset of the
            mechanisms are provided.</para>
        <para>The client configures the preferred authentication mechanism to use for an invocation
            using <olink targetdoc="messagePI" targetptr="message-interface-domain-syntax">stub configuration</olink> or
            <olink targetdoc="wsaajava" targetptr="wsaajava-secdesc-introduction">security
                descriptors</olink>. Multiple message protection mechanisms can be used to secure the
            same message, with a performance cost incurred. [The server can configure the set of
            acceptable security mechanisms an invocation using security descriptors.] The server response
            is secured with the same protection mechanism as the request.</para>
        <para> The WS Secure Conversation and Transport Layer Security mechanims allow for anonymous
            access, where the client need not furnish credentials. In this mechanism, authentication and
            message protection steps are still done and it is not an insecure call. But the keys are
            generated on the fly and the server has no way to establish the identity of the client. So
            authorization has to accomodate amonymous clients, if indeed the server would like to accept
            anonymous clients. </para>
        <para>Another important piece of security infrastructure is the ability of an entity to delegate
            its rights to another. The WS Secure Conversation mechanism allows for delegation as a part
            of the protocol and alternatively <olink targetdoc="delegation">Delegation Service</olink>
            can be used to delegate credentials to any service. </para>
        <para>The toolkit also provides <olink targetdoc="cas">Community Authorization Service
            (CAS)</olink>, a service that can be used to manage and assert fine-grained rights for
            users. </para>
