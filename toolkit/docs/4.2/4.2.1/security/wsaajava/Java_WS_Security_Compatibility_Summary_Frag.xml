    <para>Since GT 4.0.x release, some incompatible changes have been made:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Security Descriptors: The security descriptor schema has
          changed since GT 4.0.x and the descriptors from GT 4.0.x cannot be
          used as is.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Secure Conversation port type: The WS Addressing version in
          Java WS Core has been updated and the secure conversation port type
          has changed to reflect this. Therefore, GT 4.0.x secure conversation
          clients are incompatible with GT 4.2.x servers and vice
          versa.</simpara>
