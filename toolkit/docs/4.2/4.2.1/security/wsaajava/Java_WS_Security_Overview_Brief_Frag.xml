<para>The Web Services portion of GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> uses SOAP over HTTP  for communicating messages. 
WS Authentication &amp; Authorization in Java (Java WS A&amp;A) implements the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation specification to provide 
message protection for SOAP messages. Features include:

    <listitem><simpara>authentication of the sender</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>encryption of the message</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>integrity protection of the message</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>replay attack protection</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Java WS A&amp;A provides a secure channel by using HTTP over SSL/TLS (HTTPS) for transporting the messages. 
This security mechanism supports all of the security features provided by SSL/TLS with the addition of support for X.509

    The Authorization Framework component of Java WS A&amp;A provides the infrastructure to process attributes
        and protect resource access based on access policy. It allows for authorization policy to be
        configured and enforced at various levels of granularity (container, service or resource).
        It also provides client-side authorization to allow clients to authorize the services they
        access.  The framework is pluggable and can be configured to use custom mechanisms for attribute
        collection and policy evaluation. It also provides multiple authorization module
        implementations; for example, support for gridmap-based authorization, a callout module that
        uses the SAML protocol to query a external service for an authorization decision and
    such.
