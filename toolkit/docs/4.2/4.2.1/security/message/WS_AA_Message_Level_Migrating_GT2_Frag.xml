  <para>GT2 and GT3 services were set up to run with root owned <glossterm>host credentials</glossterm>. In GT4 most,
    but not all, services will run as the globus user. To allow the
    globus user to start services using host credentials the globus user needs to be able to access them. This requirement can be satisfied by making a copy of the root owned host credentials, i.e. the <glossterm>host certificate</glossterm> and  <glossterm>private key</glossterm>, owned by the globus user. In GT4 this copy is assumed to be <filename>/etc/grid-security/container{cert,key}.pem</filename>. </para>
