    <title>File permissions</title>
    <para>The Java security code currently does not enforce secure permissions and, implicitly, file
      ownership requirements on any of the security related files, e.g. configuration and credential
      files. It is thus important that administrators ensure that the relevant files have correct
      permissions and ownership. Permissions should generally be as restrictive as possible, i.e.
        <glossterm baseform="private key">private keys</glossterm> should be readable only by the
      file owner and other files should be writable by owner only, and the files should generally be
      owned by the globus user (the requirements that the C code enforces are documented in <olink
        targetdoc="prewsaaPI" targetptr="prewsaa-pi-config"/>).</para>

    <para> Also refer to <olink targetdoc="messageRN" targetptr="message-rn-knownproblems"/> for
      details on any other open issues.</para>
