Authentication in the Globus Toolkit is based on X.509 certificates.  
This document describes how to acquire and use the certificates that
you will need to authenticate yourself to Globus services.
</para>
<para>
In most cases, an individual will do the following:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>Acquire an <emphasis>end-user certificate</emphasis> from a certificate authority (CA).
This certificate will typically be valid for a year or more and will be
stored in a file in the individual's home directory.
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Use the end-user certificate to create a <emphasis>proxy certificate</emphasis>, which
will be used to authenticate the individual to grid services.  Proxy
certificates typically have a much shorter lifetime than end-user certificates.
</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>[TODO:  Add a reference to the general GSI introduction, and make sure
  there's a reference to something that explains why we use proxy certs.
  Maybe add a reference to MyProxy?]
