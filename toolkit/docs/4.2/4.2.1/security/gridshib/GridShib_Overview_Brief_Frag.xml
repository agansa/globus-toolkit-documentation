GridShib provides a set of interceptors for the Globus Toolkit runtime that allow for the parsing and application of policy based on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). These set of interceptors are commonly referred to by the nickname "GridShib for GT", abreviated GS4GT. Readers should familize themselves with the <olink targetdoc="authzframe">Authorization Framework</olink> before attempting to work with GridShib interceptors. The GridShib project produces several other software components which are not included in the Globus Toolkit distribution, including the GriShib SAML Tools and the GridShib-CA. Full documentation on all GridShib components may be found on the <ulink url="http://gridshib.globus.org">GridShib project website</ulink>.
