GridShib provides a set of interceptors for the Globus Toolkit runtime that allow for the parsing and application of policy based on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Readers should familize themselves with the <olink targetdoc="authzframe">Authorization Framework</olink> before attempting to work with GridShib interceptors. Full documentation on GridShib components may be found on the <ulink url="http://gridshib.globus.org">GridShib project website</ulink>.
