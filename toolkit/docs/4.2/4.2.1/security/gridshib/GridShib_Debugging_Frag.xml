    <title>Debugging</title>
    <!-- i had to update this to include the java ws core debugging info - if for some reason, the system tests section 
    should come first, let me know and i'll change it. cris-->
    <para>Log output from GridShib is a useful tool for debugging
  issues. Because GridShib is built on top of Java WS Core, developer debugging is the same as 
  described in <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper" targetptr="javawscore-developer-debugging"/>. For information about sys admin logging, 
      see <olink targetdoc="gridshibAdmin" targetptr="gridshib-admin-debugging"/> in the Admin Guide.</para>

  <section id="gridshib-debugging-verbose">
      <title>Enabling verbose logging</title>
  <para>As described in the above section, configuration files need to be edited to
  enable logging at different levels. For example, to see all debug logging
  statements for the delegation service, the following line needs to be added:
<screen>log4j.category.org.globus.gridshib.gt=DEBUG</screen>
  </para>
