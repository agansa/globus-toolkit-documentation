<para>CAS allows a virtual organization to express policy regarding
resources distributed across a number of sites. A CAS server issues
assertions to the virtual organization users, granting them
fine-grained access rights to resources. Servers recognize and
enforce the assertions. CAS is designed to be extensible to multiple
services and is currently supported by the GridFTP server.
 Note that there currently is no support for CAS-based authorization for web services.</para>
