    including installing, configuring, deploying, and testing the installation.</para>
<para>  <important>
    <simpara> This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
      overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" />.

  </important></para>

  <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Typically a single CAS server is run per VO

  and multiple client installations are done. This document contains

<chapter id="cas-admin-deploying"><title>Deploying</title>

  <para>The CAS service is deployed as a part of  a standard toolkit installation. 
    Please refer to the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" /> for details. Other than the steps described in
the above guide, the following are needed to deploy the CAS service.</para>


  <section id="cas-admin-casCreds"><title>Obtaining credentials for the CAS service</title>

    <para>The CAS service can run with its own service specific credentials. Instructions 

      for obtaining <glossterm>service credentials</glossterm> may be found <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/2.4/admin/guide-verify.html#ldapcert">here</ulink>.

</para>

    <para>The standard administrator clients that come with the distribution by default use  identity authorization  to authorize the service they are running against (and expect that the CAS service has credentials

      that have the FQDN of the host the server is running on and the service name &quot;cas&quot; as part of DN). Command line options can be used to specify the identity of the CAS service, if the default identity is not used. The command in the above mentioned <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/2.4/admin/guide-verify.html#ldapcert">web page</ulink> may be altered as follows to get credentials for the CAS server:</para>

    <screen>casadmin$ grid-cert-request -service <emphasis>cas</emphasis> -host <emphasis>FQDN</emphasis></screen>

    <para>The certificate and <glossterm>private key</glossterm> are typically placed in <filename>/etc/grid-security/cas-cert.pem</filename> and <filename>/etc/grid-security/cas-key.pem</filename>,

  respectively. In this document the locations of certificate and key files are

  referred to as <envar>CAS_CERT_FILE</envar> and <envar>CAS_KEY_FILE</envar>, respectively.

The subject name in these credentials is expected by CAS clients by default.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="cas-admin-dbInstall"><title>Database installation and configuration </title>

    <para>CAS uses a back end database to store all user data. This section briefly describes the installation of such a database and the <olink targetptr="cas-admin-createDb">creation of the database</olink> using  the schema required  by the CAS back end.

</para>

    <section id="cas-admin-installDb">

      <title>Installing the database </title>

      <para>While any database with a JDBC driver and support for a reasonable set of SQL may be used, Derby has been used for development and testing. The driver for the same  is included in the distribution. A default Derby database is created for CAS during installation and the CAS server uses the database in the embedded mode. One set of CAS tests also use the database in the embedded mode and another set uses in the network mode. 
</para>

<note> <para>Any JDBC compliant database might be used as backend. If a different database is used, the corresponding driver should be added to $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib. </para></note>
    </section>

    <section id="cas-admin-createDb">

      <title>Creating the CAS database </title>

      <para> By default a Derby database is created during deploy time at <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var</filename>. But schema for using PostGres or MySQL as backend is provided at <filename> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_cas_service/casDbSchema/cas_pgsql_database_schema.sql</filename> or <filename> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_cas_service/casDbSchema/cas_mysql_database_schema.sql</filename>. Please refer to PostGres or MySQL documentation for steps involved in creating the database. </para>

      <title>Bootstrapping the CAS database </title>

      <para>The CAS database needs to be initialized with data  specific to CAS and information about a super user to allow bootstrapping  of CAS operations. The command line script <emphasis>cas-server-bootstrap</emphasis> can be used to achieve this.</para>

      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

</para>

  <section>

    <title>Adding a user group </title>

    <para>Since at the time of booting up the CAS server only  the user group that

  has super user permissions on the CAS server is created, Alice  will want to

  create another user group to which new users  can be added and to which permissions 

   on newly enrolled CAS entities may be given. This also eases the process of giving the 

  same rights to many users. Given that there are two types of roles in the community

  she might want to create two groups, <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> and <emphasis>scientists</emphasis>.

</para>

    <para>Also, all permissions on the newly created group will be given to users of

  a particular user group. For example, Alice  may  want all users of the user group <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> to

  be able to manipulate the group.

</para>

    <para>To create a new user group Alice uses the <emphasis>cas-group-admin</emphasis> client. It

  requires a name for the new group being created, say <emphasis>analysts</emphasis>. 

</para>

    <screen>alice%  cas-group-admin user create analysts analysts</screen>

    <para>This will create a user group <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> and give all users in that group

  the permission to manage the group (i.e add users, remove users and so on).

  She can similarly create a group called <emphasis>scientists</emphasis>.</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding a trust anchor</title>

    <para>Prior to adding Bob and Carol to the CAS server, Alice needs to ensure that the

  trust anchors for both have been added. If they share the trust anchor

  with Alice then this step can be skipped, since at bootstrap Alice&apos;s trust

  anchor would have been added to the database. 

</para>

    <para>In our example Alice and Carol share a trust anchor different from Bob&apos;s.

  Therefore, Alice needs to add Bob&apos;s trust anchor by using the <emphasis>cas-enroll</emphasis> client

  with the <emphasis>trustAnchor</emphasis> option. She needs to provide details about the

  trust anchor such as the authentication method and authentication data used.

</para>

    <screen>alice%  cas-enroll trustAnchor analysts AbcTrust X509 &quot;/C=US/O=some/CN=ABC CA&quot;</screen>

    <para>The above will enroll a trust anchor with nickname <emphasis>AbcTrust</emphasis> that uses <emphasis>X509</emphasis> as its authentication method and has the DN specified in the command. The members of

the <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> user group are given all rights on this object. This implies

that any user who has this trust anchor  is assumed to present credentials signed by

this trust anchor.

</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding users</title>

    <para>Now Alice can add Bob and Carol as users using the <emphasis>cas-enroll</emphasis> command

  with the <emphasis>user</emphasis> option. She needs to provide the user&apos;s subject DN and

  a reference to the trust anchor used by the user. As with any entity added

  to the CAS server, the admin needs to choose a user group whose members will

  have all permissions on that entity. In this example, Alice would like the

  members of the user group <emphasis>suUser</emphasis> to be able to manipulate the user entity <emphasis>Bob</emphasis>.

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-enroll user suUser bob &quot;/O=Our Community/CN=Bob Foo&quot; AbcTrust</screen>

    <para>Alice uses a similar command to add Carol to the CAS database.

</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding users to a user group</title>

    <para>The CAS server allows rights to be assigned only to user groups and not to individual

  users. Hence, before Alice can assign rights to Bob or Carol, she needs to add

  them to some user group. She does this by using  the <command>cas-group-add-entry</command> client

  with the <emphasis>user</emphasis> option to indicate she is adding to a user group. This

  client requires the group name and the nickname of the user who needs to be added.

  To add Bob to the <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> group, the command would be:

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-group-add-entry user analysts bob</screen>

    <para>If a user group <emphasis>scientists</emphasis> was created, Carol could similarly be added

  as a member.</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding a new FTP server</title>

    <para>Alice now has the community users in the database. The next step is 

  to add some resources. Because the community currently has the FTP server

  foo.bar.edu available to it she will add it to the CAS database.

</para>

    <para>Each resource or object in the CAS server has a namespace associated  with it

  that defines certain features. For example, it can define the comparison algorithm

  that is to be used when the object&apos;s name is compared. It may

  also define the base URL that should be prefixed to objects that belong to

  this namespace. In this case, Alice chooses to use the <emphasis>FTPDirectoryTree</emphasis> namespace

  that is added to the CAS server at startup. She uses the <emphasis>cas-enroll</emphasis> client

  with the <emphasis>object</emphasis> option to add the FTP server to the CAS database:

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/* FTPDirectoryTree</screen>

    <para>This command adds the FTP server as an object and gives all members of the <emphasis>suGroup</emphasis> rights

to manipulate the object.

</para>

    <para>To be able to grant/revoke access on an individual directory, add an object

  for the directory. For example, if Alice would like to be able to manipulate

  the <emphasis>data</emphasis> directory on the server as a separate entity, the following command will

  add an object for that.

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/* FTPDirectoryTree</screen>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Creating an object group </title>

    <para>Alice suspects that the community will end up with more directories containing

  data on other servers that will have polices identical with the  ones on the /data directory

  on foo.bar.edu. To manage this  she is going to create an object group called <emphasis>data</emphasis> and

  assign foo.bar.edu/data to this group. This will allow her to grant rights

  on this group and easily add other directories to this group later.

</para>

    <para>To create a group called <emphasis>data</emphasis>, she uses the <emphasis>cas-group-admin</emphasis> client

  with the <emphasis>group</emphasis> and <emphasis>create</emphasis> options:

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-group-admin object create suGroup data</screen>

    <para>This creates an object group called <emphasis>data</emphasis> and the members of <emphasis>suGroup</emphasis> get

all rights on this group and hence should be able to add/remove members, grant

rights to add/delete from this group to others and also delete this group.

</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding members to an object group</title>

    <para>Alice now can add foo.bar.edu/data to the <emphasis>data</emphasis> group. She can do this

  by using the <emphasis>cas-group-add-entry</emphasis> with the <emphasis>object</emphasis> option. To add

  the above object, <emphasis>ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*</emphasis> in the namespace <emphasis>FooFTPNamespace</emphasis>,

  to the object group <emphasis>data</emphasis> Alice uses the following command:

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-group-add-entry object data object FooFTPNamespace ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*</screen>

    <para>In the above command:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>

        <simpara>the first <emphasis>object</emphasis> refers to the group type.</simpara>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <simpara><emphasis>data</emphasis> is the name of the object group.</simpara>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <simpara>the second <emphasis>object</emphasis> refers to the type of CAS entity that is being added as a member.</simpara>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <simpara>the last two parameters define the namespace and the object that needs to be added. </simpara>

      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Adding service types </title>

    <para>Alice now needs to add information about the kinds of rights that can be

  granted for these objects. These are stored as <emphasis>service types</emphasis> and relevant

  actions are mapped to these service types.</para>

    <para>In this scenario, the kind of service types that Alice should add would be <emphasis>file</emphasis>, <emphasis>directory</emphasis> and

  so on. To do so the <emphasis>cas-enroll</emphasis> client with the <emphasis>serviceType</emphasis> option

  may be used. To add a service type called <emphasis>file</emphasis> and give members of <emphasis>suGroup</emphasis> all

  rights on this service type Alice uses the following command.</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-enroll serviceType suGroup file</screen>

  </section>

  <section id="cas-admin-example-action">

    <title>Adding action mappings</title>

    <para>The relevant action mappings to the above mentioned service types would be <emphasis>read</emphasis>, <emphasis>write</emphasis> and

  so on. Alice needs to add these mappings to the database so that she can grant

  rights that allow a user to have <emphasis>file/read</emphasis> or <emphasis>file/write</emphasis> permissions

  on some object.

</para>

    <para>To add action mappings to a service type, she uses the <command>cas-action</command> client

  with the <option>add</option> option. The following command adds a mapping of action <emphasis>read</emphasis> to

  service type <emphasis>file</emphasis>.

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-action add file add</screen>

    <para>Similarly, she can add other mappings, like <emphasis>write</emphasis>, to this service type.

</para>

  </section>

  <section>

    <title>Granting permissions</title>

    <para>Alice now has resources in the object group <emphasis>data</emphasis> and users in the

  user groups <emphasis>analysts</emphasis> and <emphasis>scientists</emphasis>. She now wants to grant permissions

  on  the <emphasis>data</emphasis> group to the analysts and scientists, namely read permissions

  to the analysts and read and write permissions to the scientists.

</para>

    <para>To grant permissions Alice needs to use the <command>cas-rights-admin</command> with

  the <option>grant</option> option. To give read permissions to the analysts group Alice

  runs: 

</para>

    <screen>alice% cas-rights-admin grant analysts objectGroup data serviceAction file read</screen>

    <para>She similarly grants rights to <emphasis>scientists</emphasis> group.
