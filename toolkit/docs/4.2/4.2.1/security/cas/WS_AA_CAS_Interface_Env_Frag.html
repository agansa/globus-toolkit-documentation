<p>The <i>cas-proxy-init</i> program as well as the CAS administrative
program use the following environment variables to determine the
appropriate URL to connect to and server identity to expect. The URL
is determined using this algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-c</b> commandline option was specified, the URL
specified with that option is used.</li>

<li>Otherwise, the <b>CAS_SERVER_URL</b> environment variable must be
set, and its value is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The server identity (i.e. the expected subject name of the CAS
server certificate) is determined in a similar fashion:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-s</b> commandline option was specified, use the
value specified with that option as the identity</li>

<li>Otherwise, if the <b>CAS_SERVER_IDENTITY</b> environment variable
is set, use the value of that variable as the expected server
identity.</li>

<li>If neither is set, host authorization is done and the
expected server credential is <i>cas/<fqdn></i>, where <fqdn> is the
fully qualified domain name of the host on which the CAS service is
up.</li>
</ul>
