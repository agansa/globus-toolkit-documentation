<chapter id="sgas-admin-installing"><title>Building and installing</title>
 <para>Building from source is only needed if you need to modify or test the source code for some reason.</para>
 <para>The source code is available in the same installer tar ball as the binaries, in the file <filename>sgas-4.0.1-src.tar.gz</filename>. 
  To build from source, extract the files in that tar ball and run the make-dist script contained therein.</para>
 <para>Source code is available via AFS. To retrieve the latest code set your CVSROOT environment variable to: 
  <filename>/afs/pdc.kth.se/src/packages/SweGrid/SourceRepository</filename>. Then export the code by running the following command:</para>
 <screen>cvs export -D today accounting</screen>
 <para>If you don't have access to AFS you can also download a nightly checkout of the code from 
  <ulink url="http://www.sgas.se/source/">http://www.sgas.se/source/</ulink>.</para>

 <para>A test suite for an SGAS installation is provided. To use it run:</para>
 <screen>build.sh run-test</screen>

<chapter id="sgas-admin-troubleshooting"><title>Troubleshooting</title>
 <para>Detailed error messages, such as stack traces are not logged to the command line utility (<command>sgas-admin</command>) 
  output but instead are written to an error log file. The default location of this file is <filename>./sgas-admin.log</filename>. 
  The location and other SGAS admin log properties can be changed in the file 
  <filename>etc/sgas-client/sgas-admin-log4j.properties</filename> in the 
  SGAS installation directory. The errors displayed in the command line tool share the same correlation id (CID) 
  as the errors in the error log file.</para>
 <para>If you encounter problems or need assistance, don't hesitate to send an email to swegrid-accounting@pdc.kth.se.</para>
