<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>

<para> This component consists of two services: the delegation factory
service and the delegation service</para>

<para>The delegation factory service exposes its public credential as a
resource property and clients can delegate in credential bound to that
public key. Upon delegation, an Endpoint Reference(EPR) to the
delegated credential, which is a resource of the delegation service,
is returned to the client. The client can provide a reference to the
delegated credential to other services by providing the EPR.</para>

<para>The delegation service itslef has an interface to allow for
refreshing the credentials remotely. Other co-hosted services could
register interest in delegated credentials through listeners and are
notified when credentials are refreshed.</para>
