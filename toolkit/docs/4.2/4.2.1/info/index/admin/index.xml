    <para> The WS MDS Index Service has been tested to work without any additional setup when deployed into Tomcat. [xinclude deploy info] Please follow these <olink targetdoc="javawscoreAdmin" targetptr="javawscore-admin-tomcat-deploying"/> to deploy GT4 services into Tomcat. Note: please complete any prerequisite service configuration steps before you deploy into Tomcat.</para>

Troubleshooting</title>
<para><emphasis>Problem: An index service entry has AggregatorConfig data but an empty
AggregatorData entry.</emphasis></para> 
    
    <para>Solution: There is probably something wrong with the
registration. For example, a registration that uses
    QueryAggregatorSource <glossterm>aggregator source</glossterm> may have incorrect values
for the resource's hostname or port number or a misspelled resource
property name, or the remote resource may impose security
restrictions that prevent the queries from the index from working.
You can use the standard toolkit resource property query tools
        (such as <olink targetdoc="indexDeveloper" targetptr="wsrf-get-properties"/>) to verify that the
remote resource is responding.</para>
