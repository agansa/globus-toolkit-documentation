<h1>Registering an RFT service to an index</h1>

<p>This document gives instructions on how to register
   an <a href="../../../data/rft/">RFT service</a> to an index 
   service.</p>

<p>You must have a working RFT service, as documented
   in the <a href="../../../data/rft/admin/">RFT administrators 
   guide</a>. You must also have a working index service, as 
   documented in the main <a href="index.html">Index Service
   administrators guide</a>.
</p>

<p>You must know the URL to the reliable file transfer factory. This can be
   seen in the container output at startup of the container on the
   RFT host, and will look something 
   like this:<br />
   <code>http://myhost:8080/wsrf/services/ReliableFileTransferFactoryService</code>
</p>

<p>You must also know the URL to the index service. This can be seen in the
   container output at startup of the container on the index host, and will
   look something like this: <br />
   <code>http://myhost:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService</code>
</p>

<p>The <a href="../../aggregator/admin/"><code>mds-servicegroup-add</code></a> 
   tool must be configured to create and maintain the registration. If the
   tool is already being used to maintain other registrations, the 
   configuration file can be extended to also maintain one or more 
   RFT registrations. Otherwise, a new deployment of the tool must be made.
</p>

<p>As supplied, the RFT factory service will not permit resource properties
   to be queried with authentication. This can be modified by editing
   (in the RFT installation) 
   <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_rft/security-config.xml</code>
   to look like this:

   TODO

</p>

<p>
The configuration for <code>service-group-add</code> should look 
something like this (change URLs to RFT and Index services to point
to the right places):

   TODO

</p>
