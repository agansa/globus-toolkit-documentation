<p>Monitoring and discovery mechanisms are concerned with finding, distributing,
  indexing, and otherwise processing information about the configuration
  and state of services and resources. In some cases, the motivation for collecting
  this information is to enable discovery of services or resources; in other
  cases, it is to enable monitoring of system status. In GT4, these mechanisms
  are provided by the Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS), as described in <a href="key/">MDS
  Key Concepts</a>. </p>
<p>GT4 includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WS MDS, the WSRF  implementation of MDS, which consists of:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index/">Index Service</a>, 
which collects monitoring and discovery information
from Grid resources, and publishes it in a single location.</li>
      <li> <a href="trigger/">Trigger Service</a>, which 
 collects data from resources on the grid and, 
if administrator defined rules match, can perform various actions.</li>
      <li><a href="aggregator/">Aggregator Framework</a>, 
the software framework on which the above WS MDS
services are built.</li>
      <li><a href="webmds/">WebMDS</a>, 
 which enables end users to view monitoring information via a standard
web browser interface, without installing any additional software on their
PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="prewsmds/">Pre-WS MDS</a>,  the MDS implementation first introduced in GT2 (which is now
    deprecated). </li>
</ul>
