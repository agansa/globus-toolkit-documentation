<p>The <EM>Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS)</EM> is a suite of web services to monitor and discover resources and services on
  Grids. This system allows users to discover what resources are considered part
  of a <EM>Virtual Organization (VO)</EM> and to monitor those resources. MDS
  services provide query and subscription interfaces to arbitrarily detailed
  resource data and a trigger interface that can be configured to take action
  when pre-configured trouble conditions are met.. For more conceptual information
  about MDS, see <a href="key/">MDS
  Key Concepts</a>. </p>
<p>GT4 includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WS MDS, the WSRF  implementation of MDS, which consists of:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index/">Index Service</a>, 
which collects monitoring and discovery information
from Grid resources, and publishes it in a single location.</li>
      <li> <a href="trigger/">Trigger Service</a>, which 
 collects data from resources on the grid and, 
if administrator defined rules match, can perform various actions.</li>
      <li><a href="aggregator/">Aggregator Framework</a>, 
the software framework on which the above WS MDS
services are built.</li>
      <li><a href="webmds/">WebMDS</a>, 
 which enables end users to view monitoring information via a standard
web browser interface, without installing any additional software on their
PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="prewsmds/">Pre-WS MDS</a>,  the MDS implementation first introduced in GT2 (which is now
    deprecated). </li>
</ul>
