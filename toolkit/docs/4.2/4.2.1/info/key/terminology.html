<h2>Aggregator Service</h2>
A service that collects information using the WS-MDS aggregation framework,
and then does something with it.  WS-MDS includes two aggregation services:
MDS-Index, which publishes information as service groups, and MDS-Trigger,
which runs an arbitrary executable program, passing the information as input to
that program.  A third aggregation service is planned:  and MDS-Archive, which
will maintain an archive of historical information.
<p>
[Maybe I should have called this an "aggregator service" -- Laura</p>
<p>yeah - i'd go with &quot;aggregator service&quot; because that's ian's term -  unless
  there's a strong reason for not using it -- Cris]. </p>
<h2>information</h2>
<p>The information itself as structured data. For monitored entities that are
  WS-Resources, this is equivalent to resource properties.</p>
<p>
[I'm not sure we really need this definition.  -- Laura</p>
<p>that's fine. it's more for <em>me</em>. --Cris] </p>
<h2>monitored entities/Grid resources </h2>
<p>That which is being monitored (for WSRF services, equivalent to WS-Resources).
  Essentially any entity in a virtual organization (VO) from which an aggregator
  service can obtain information: for example, a file, a program, a Web service,
  or another network-enabled service.</p>
<p>[cris] i'm leaning towards &quot;Grid resources&quot; </p>
<h2>information sources</h2>
<p>Sources of information about a monitored entity. </p>
<p>[what else can we
    say about them? samples? -- Cris] </p>
<p> NOTE: something can be both a monitored entity *and* an information source
  if it collects information about itself (e.g., when a WSRF service provides
  information about its own resource properties)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>aggregator source</h2>
<p>An aggregator source collects  information about a monitored entity
  from an information source and passes it to an aggregator service (usually
  an MDS-Index service). More specifically, an aggregator source is a java class
  that implements the AggregatorSource interface to take information about a
  monitored entity from an information source and pass it to an aggregator service
  in XML. The MDS-Index service calls the aggregator to collect information.
  There are several kinds of aggregator sources. </p>
<p>
[Cris had a section here on types of aggregator sources, but I don't think it
really added much beyond the list of examples.  That is, I think saying "here
are some aggregator sources that we provide" is enough, and we don't need to
come up with a taxonomy of the different types of aggregator source.  -- Laura</p>
<p>cool --Cris ] </p>
Several aggregator sources are included as part of the GT distribution, including
<ul>
  <li>&lt;poll-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which polls WSRF services
    for resource properties</li>
  <li>&lt;subscribe-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which receives
    resource properties from WSRF services through subscription/notification</li>
  <li>&lt;executable-source-name&gt;, a non-WSRF aggregator source which runs
    an executable to acquire (or generate) information in some XML form.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relationship between aggregator source, information source and monitored
  entity </h3>
<p>In theory, an aggregator source could simply generate information on its own;
  in practice, however, aggregator sources generally communicate with information
  sources. In turn, information sources can publish information about themselves
  (which also makes it a monitoring entity) but many times publishes information
  about a separate monitored entity. </p>
<p>The following table uses three different examples to describe the relationships:</p>
<p>[need help filling in examples - or let me know if there's a better way to
  represent examples. -- Cris] </p>
