<h2><a name=overview></a>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't done so already, we recommend reading
  the <a href="#">GT4 Key Concepts guide</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>The Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS) component of Globus Toolkit V4
  (GT4) can streamline the tasks of monitoring and discovering services and resources  in a distributed system or Grid :</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Monitoring</em> is the process of observing Grid resources (e.g.,
    computers and schedulers), for such purposes as fixing problems and tracking
    usage. For example, a user might use a monitoring system to identify resources
    that are running low on disk space, in order to take corrective action.</li>
  <li><em>Discovery</em> is the process of finding a suitable Grid resource to
    perform a task: for example, finding a compute host on which to run a job.
    This process may involve both finding which Grid resources are suitable (e.g.,
    have the correct CPU architecture) and choosing a suitable member from that
    set (e.g., the one with the shortest submission queue).</li>
</ul>
<font color="#800080"></font>
<p>In this documentation, the concepts of MDS are
    written for the latest version,  WS MDS (also known
  as MDS4). The GT4 release includes the Pre-WS component,
  MDS2, for legacy purposes only - it will be deprecated at some future time
  as experience is gained with the WS implementation (for information about MDS2,
  click <a href="http://www.globus.org/mds/mds2/">here</a>.) </p>
<p>Both monitoring and discovery applications require the ability to collect
   information about Grid resources from multiple, perhaps distributed,
  sources (referred to as<em> information sources</em>.) To meet this need, WS MDS provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>so-called <em>aggregator services</em> (primarily the MDS-Index service)
    that collect recent state information from registered Grid resources, and
    then [does something with it.]</li>
  <li>browser-based interfaces, command
    line tools, and Web service interfaces that allow users/machines
  to query and access the collected information.</li>
</ul>
<p>WS MDS is based on the <a href="link_to_OGSA_info">OGSA</a> architecture using
  the <a href="link_to_WSRF_info">WSRF</a> implementation. It makes heavy use
  of XML and Web service interfaces to simplify the tasks of registering information
  sources and locating and accessing information of interest. In particular,
  all information collected by aggregator services is maintained as XML, and
  can be queried via Xpath queries (as well as other Web services mechanisms.) </p>
<p>WS MDS has similar features to, but does not interoperate
      with MDS2. The following table is a
    breakdown of the differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More powerful query language: Xpath instead of LDAP</li>
  <li>Simpler
        and therefore more robust implementation, due to fewer components</li>
  <li>Simpler
          (indeed, in simple cases, totally automated) configuration, due to
    fewer components and tight integration with the GT4 implementation</li>
  <li>Convenient
            interface to arbitrary information sources due to extensible architecture.</li>
  <li>No
              requirement for pre-defined schema in information providers. </li>
  <li>Lower performance due to use of XML protocols</li>
</ul>
<h2><a
name=concepts></a>Conceptual details</h2>
<p>This section will define the &quot;major players&quot; of WS MDS, then describe how
  they fit together in a basic framework:</p>

  </li>
  <li>Basic WS MDS deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grid resources</h3>
<p><em>Grid resources</em> are essentially any entity in a virtual organization
  (VO) from which a user wants to obtain information: for example, a file, a
program, a Web service, or another network-enabled service. </p>
<h3>Information sources</h3>
<p><em>Information sources</em> are basically sources of information about a
  Grid resource you want to monitor. An information source collects the information
  from the Grid resource and formats it so that it is compatible with WS MDS.
  Information sources can either be Java classes in the Aggregator framework
  or executables. Many times, a Grid resource can be its own information source
  if it collects information about itself. The most common example in WS MDS
  is a WSRF service, which provides information about its own resource properties
(WS-Resources.)   </p>
<h3>Aggregator services </h3>
<p>A service that collects information using the WS-MDS aggregator framework,
and then [does something with it]. WS-MDS includes two aggregator services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>MDS-Index, which is the main component
  for collecting structured data from information sources and making the information
    available via a Web Services interface. </li>
  <li>MDS-Trigger, which passes this information to an executable (configured
    by the administrator), which may take an action such as sending email.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A third aggregator service is planned: an MDS-Archive, which will maintain
  an archive of historical information.</p>
<p>WS MDS aggregator services are distinguished from a traditional static registry
  such as UDDI by their soft-state registration of information sources and periodic
  refresh of the structured data that they store. This dynamic behavior enables
  scalable discovery by allowing users to access &ldquo;recent&rdquo; information
without accessing the information sources directly. </p>
<p>However, note that the information obtained may not be the absolute latest.
  Also, as aggregator services do not interpret policy information, there is
  no guarantee that a user will be allowed to access a service discovered in
  this way.</p>
<h3><a name="basicframework"></a>Basic framework</h3>
<p>The key to understanding WS MDS is the aggregator service/information
  source framework. The basic process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Grid resources</em> are
        explicitly registered with an <em>aggregator service</em>.  </li>
  <li>The aggregator service periodically collects up-to-date state or status
        information from all registered Grid resources using specific <em>information
        sources</em>. </li>
  <li>The aggregator service then publishes this information to the user [makes
    this information available to the user].</li>
</ol>
<h3>1) Registering Grid resources </h3>
<p>An aggregator service registers with a  Grid resource via
  a Web service (WS-ServiceGroup) Add operation. Registrations have
a lifetime: if not renewed periodically, they expire. Thus, an aggregator
service is self-cleaning: outdated entries disappear automatically when they
do not renew their registrations.</p>
<p>Two registration modes are supported;
    each also defines the access mechanism for the associated Grid resource. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The more general registration mode allows information to be obtained from
        an arbitrary source (whether or not it's a WSRF-compliant Web service).
    In this mode, a Grid resource is registered by providing a user-supplied
        program that is run periodically to obtain up-to-date data .&nbsp;This
        user program can either generate the information locally or use a source-specific
        protocol to access the information remotely. The program must convert
        non-XML data into an appropriate XML representation.</li>
  <li>A more streamlined form of registration is supported for WSRF-compliant
      Web services. Such services need simply to&nbsp;make status and state information
      available as WSRF resource properties.&nbsp;At registration time, the user
      specifies whether the aggregator service should either:
      <ul>
        <li>use <em>pull</em> resource
        properties, using the WSRF &ldquo;get
                    resource property&rdquo; interface; or </li>
        <li> subscribe to resource
                        property changes so that values are <em>pushed</em> via
                            WS-Notification subscription methods.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>[is this how Trigger registers with Grid resources??] </p>
<p><img src="registering_grid_resources.jpg" width="1000" height="757"></p>
<h3>2) Collecting the information </h3>
<p>The information source is the 'compatibility' link between the Grid resource
  and the aggregator service; its purpose is to ensure the information
  is formatted in a way the aggregator service understands (namely, well-formed
  XML). </p>
<p>If the Grid resource
    is a WSRF service, then it provides WS resource properties that are already
  compatible with aggregator services. Therefore, it acts as its own information
  source and can passes on its information via a Java class of the Aggregator
  framework (developers can find more information about the Aggregator framework <a href="#">here</a>.)  </p>
<p>If the Grid resource is not a WSRF resource, then an external executable program
    is required to format the information. </p>
<p>GT4 is configured to use WS MDS components
    for discovery and monitoring of GT4 services and provides built-in information
  sources, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every GT4 service supports a minimal set of resource properties (an informal
    service name and a service startup time) and thus can be registered easily
    into one or more aggregator services for monitoring and discovery. <font color="purple">[provide
    list/links]</font> </li>
  <li>Two GT4 services, GRAM and RFT, also publish a larger set of service-specific
    information. These values are documented in the service descriptions for
    GRAM and RFT <font color="purple">[provide list/links]</font> and also in
    the <a href="#">GT4 resource properties catalog</a>.</li>
  <li>The GT4 distribution also includes information source executables to enable
    registering GridFTP and RLS (which are <strong>not</strong> WSRF-compliant
    Web services) into aggregator services <font color="purple">[provide list/links].</font></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="collecting_info.jpg" width="999" height="757"></p>
<h3>3) Publishing the information </h3>
<p>Aggregator services 
  publish the collected information for the user in many different formats.</p>
<p>The <em>MDS-Index</em> service makes the  collected data available as XML
  documents. More specifically, the data is maintained as WSRF resource properties,
  thus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can write their own applications that collect information using <em>Web
      services interfaces</em>, namely the WSRF get-property and WS-Notification
      subscribe operations, for which GT4 provides C, Java, and Python APIs.</li>
  <li>The command line tool <a href="../../common/javawscore/user/index.html#wsrf-get-property"><code>wsrf-get-property</code></a> can
    be used to retrieve resource properties, with the desired resource property
    specified via an Xpath expression.</li>
  <li>A tool called WebMDS presents MDS-Index information in a standard web browser.
    WebMDS is highly configurable, using XSLT transformations to describe how
    MDS-Index resource properties are converted to HTML. Standard transformations
    included in GT4 provide an interface that displays overview information,
    with hyperlinks giving the ability to drill down and view more detailed information
    about each monitored resource. </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../index/">MDS-Index service documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>MDS-Trigger</em> service performs user-specified actions (such as
  sending email or generating a log-file entry) whenever collected information
  matches criteria determined by the users. MDS-Trigger defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a Web service interface that allows a client to register an Xpath query;
    and</li>
  <li>a program to be executed whenever a new value matches a user-supplied matching
    rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../trigger/">MDS-Trigger service documentation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="publishing_info.jpg" width="999" height="757"></p>
<h3><a name="basicdeployment"></a>Basic WS MDS Deployment</h3>
<p>Every standard GT4 Web services hosting environment includes a default MDS-Index
  service. Any GT4 services running in that hosting environment (e.g.,
  GRAM, CAS, RFT) are automatically registered. Thus, each installation on a
  platform has an index that allows you to discover what services are available.</p>
<p>Since virtual organizations (VOs) often need to keep track of all available
  WS-Resources,  GT4
  also provides a simple method for specifying one or more default indexes to
  be a VO-wide MDS-Index. In this setup,  each WS-Resource registered
  to a default MDS-Index is also registered in the VO MDS-Index.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description of a basic deployment within a VO, see <a href="deployment_overview.html">Deploying
    WS MDS in a Virtual Organization</a>. </p>
<h2><a name=relateddocs></a>Performance Characteristics</h2>
<p>We only have very preliminary performance data at this time. These data suggest
  that WS MDS aggregator services can support query rates of the order of tens
  of queries per second (depending on data sizes) and a few hundred information
  sources, depending on registration and information update rates. We emphasize
  that these are not accurate data. We welcome feedback on application requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to WS MDS' use of XML protocols, performance is
  currently lower than that of MDS2. </p>

<p>[Index | but which guide? Dev/Admin/User ] In the default installation, the
  most useful information collected and made available by MDS is from:</p>
<ul>
  <li> GRAM
      compute job submission service - the collected information includes details
      of each queue to which jobs can be submitted, including name of the queue
    and number of jobs in the queue. The information also includes information
    about the underlying cluster or host that will be used to execute the compute
    job, with details such as CPU type and disk space</li>
  <li>RFT reliable file transfer service
        interface to GridFTP - the collected information includes a number of
    numerical statistics such as the
      total number of files transferred, total number of bytes transferred, and
    the number of transfers underway at present</li>
