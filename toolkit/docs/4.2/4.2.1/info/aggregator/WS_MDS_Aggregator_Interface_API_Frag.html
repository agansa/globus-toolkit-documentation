<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p><font color="purple">[Description of the programming model here]</font></p>
<p>The aggregator module consists of an Aggregating ServiceGroup framework
which supports plugins as detailed below, as well as a number of
standard plugins.
</p>

<h4>The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework</h4>

<p>The aggregating servicegroup framework is designed to facilitate the
collecting of information from or about WS-Resources (via plugin 
aggregator sources) and the feeding of that informatio to plugin
aggregator sinks.
</p>
<p>The framework provides for over-the-wire management of the list 
of registered resources (through a WS-ServiceGroup interface) and
a Java API for connecting sources and sinks together.
</p>

<p>In general (although this is not a hard requirement), aggregator sinks will 
be tied into a specific service implementation, whilst aggregator
sources are more independent. (For example, the trigger and archive
services act as sinks)

<h4>The standard plugins</h4>
<p>A number of standard aggregator sources are provided, which implement
the aggregator source API. These provide for collecting information
from/about a WS-Resource by: 
<ul> <li>WS-ResourceProperties poll operations</li>
     <li>WS-Notfication subscription</li>
     <li>Execution of arbitrary executables</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Component API</h3>

<p>TODO need to link to the javadocs primarily for 
org.globus.mds.aggregator.impl.AggregatorSink and 
org.globus.mds.aggregator.impl.AggregatorSource.
