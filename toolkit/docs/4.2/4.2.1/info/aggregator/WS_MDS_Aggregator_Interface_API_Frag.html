<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>The aggregator framework module consists of an Aggregating ServiceGroup framework
which supports plugins as detailed below, as well as a number of
standard plugins.
</p>

<h4>The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework</h4>

<p>The aggregating servicegroup framework is designed to facilitate the
collecting of information from or about WS-Resources (via plugin 
aggregator  sources) and the feeding of that information to plugin
aggregator  sinks.
</p>
<p>The framework provides for over-the-wire management of the list 
of registered resources (through a WS-ServiceGroup interface) and
a Java API for connecting sources and sinks together.
</p>

<p>In general (although this is not a hard requirement), aggregator  sinks will
  be tied into a specific service implementation, whilst aggregator 
sources are more independent. (For example, the trigger and archive
services act as sinks)

<h4>The standard plugins</h4>
<p>A number of standard aggregator  sources are provided, which implement
the aggregator  source API. These provide for collecting information
from/about a WS-Resource by: 
<ul> <li>WS-ResourceProperties poll operations</li>
     <li>WS-Notfication subscription</li>
     <li>Execution of arbitrary executables</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Component API</h3>

<p>There are two main Java interfaces in the aggregator framework. 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/javadoc-3.9.3/globus_wsrf_mds_aggregator/org/globus/mds/aggregator/impl/AggregatorSink.html">AggregatorSink</a>
    - which is implemented by sinks that can receive data from
    the aggregator  framework.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/javadoc-3.9.3/globus_wsrf_mds_aggregator/org/globus/mds/aggregator/impl/AggregatorSource.html">AggregatorSource</a>
    - which is implemented by sources that can feed data into
    the aggregator  framework.</li>
</ul>
