        <title>Configuring the Aggregator Framework</title>
  <para>MDS4 aggregator services (such as MDS Index, MDS Trigger and MDS Archive Tech Preview) inherit their 
    configuration system from the <glossterm>Aggregator Framework</glossterm> module. </para>
  <para>The Aggregator Framework does not have its own service side configuration, although services
    which are based on the framework have their own service side configuration options (such as
      <olink targetdoc="index">MDS Index</olink> and <olink targetdoc="trigger">MDS
    Trigger"</olink>) which are documented in the per-service documentation.</para>
  <para>Registrations to a working Aggregator Framework are configured for the <olink targetdoc="aggregatorDeveloper"
      targetptr="mds-servicegroup-add"/> tool. This tool takes an XML configuration file listing
    registrations, and causes those registrations to be made.</para>
  <para> In general, configuration of aggregator services involves configuring the service to get
    information from one or more sources in a Grid. The mechanism for doing this is defined by
    (inherited from) the Aggregator Framework and described in this section.</para>

    <title>Configuration overview</title>
    <para>Configuring an Aggregating Service Group to perform a data aggregation is performed by
      specifying an AggregatorContent object as the content parameter of a ServiceGroup <emphasis>
        <emphasis>add</emphasis>
      </emphasis> method invocation. An AggregatorContent object is composed of two xsd:any arrays:
      AggregatorConfig and AggregatorData:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>The AggregatorConfig xsd:any array is used to specify parameters that are to be
          passed to the underlying AggregatorSource when the ServiceGroup<emphasis>add</emphasis>
          method is invoked. These parameters are generally type-specific to the implementation of
          the AggregatorSource and/or AggregatorSink being used.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>The AggregatorData xsd:any array is used as the storage location for aggregated
          data that is the result of message deliveries to the AggregatorSink. Generally, the
          AggregatorData parameter of the AggregatorContent is not populated when the ServiceGroup <emphasis>
            <emphasis>add</emphasis>
          </emphasis> method is invoked, but rather is populated by message delivery from the
          AggregatorSource.</simpara>

      <title>Configuring the Aggregator Sink</title>
      <para>An aggregator sink may require sink-specific configuration (for example, the MDS
          <glossterm>Trigger Service</glossterm> requires sink-specific configuration; the MDS
          <glossterm>Index Service</glossterm> does not). See the documentation for the specific
          <glossterm baseform="aggregator services">aggregator service</glossterm> being used for
        details on sink-specific documentation.</para>

        <title>Disabling the publishing of the aggregator configuration on the server side</title>
        <para> It is now possible to disable the publishing of the aggregator configuration along
          with the aggregated data. The following optional parameter can be added to the
            <emphasis>AggregatorConfiguration</emphasis> section of the service
            <filename>jndi-config.xml</filename> file:<screen> &lt;parameter&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;publishAggregatorConfiguration&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/parameter&gt;</screen> By
          default, this option is disabled and the aggregator configuration information is
          published.</para>
