    <title>MDS4 Aggregator Services (Index Service and Trigger Service) Security Considerations</title>
    <para>By default, the <glossterm baseform="aggregator source">aggregator sources</glossterm> do
        not use authentication credentials -- they retrieve information using anonymous SSL
        authentication or no authentication at all, and thus retrieve only publicly-available
        information. If a user or administrator changes that configuration so that a service's
        aggregator source uses credentials to acquire non-privileged data, then that user or
        administrator must configure the service's aggregator sink to limit access to authorized
        users.</para>
