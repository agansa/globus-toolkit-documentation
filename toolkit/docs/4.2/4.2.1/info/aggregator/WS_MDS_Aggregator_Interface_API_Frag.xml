<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>
<para>The aggregator framework module consists of an Aggregating
ServiceGroup framework which supports plugins as detailed below, as
well as a number of standard plugins.</para>
</section>
<section><title>The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework</title>
<para>The aggregating servicegroup framework is designed to facilitate
the collecting of information from or about WS-Resources (via
plugin aggregator sources) and the feeding of that information to
plugin aggregator sinks.</para>
<para>The framework provides for over-the-wire management of the list
of registered resources (through a WS-ServiceGroup interface) and a
Java API for connecting sources and sinks together.</para>
<para>In general (although this is not a hard requirement), aggregator
sinks will be tied into a specific service implementation, whilst
aggregator sources are more independent. (For example, the trigger
and archive services act as sinks)</para>
</section>
<section><title>The standard plugins</title>
<para>A number of standard aggregator sources are provided, which
implement the aggregator source API. These provide for collecting
information from/about a WS-Resource by:

<section><title>Component API</title>
<para>There are two main Java interfaces in the aggregator
framework.
