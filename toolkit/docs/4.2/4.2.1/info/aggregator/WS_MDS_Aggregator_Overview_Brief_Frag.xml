    <para>The Aggregator Framework is the software framework on which WS MDS services (currently,
        the <olink targetdoc="index">Index</olink>, <olink
            targetdoc="trigger">Trigger</olink> and <olink
                targetdoc="trigger">Archive</olink> Services) are built. The Aggregator
        Framework collects data from an <glossterm>aggregator source</glossterm> and sends that data
        to an <emphasis>aggregator sink</emphasis> for processing. Aggregator sources distributed
        with the Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data, acquire data through
        subscription/notification, and execute programs to generate data. Aggregator sinks include
        modules that implement the Index, Trigger and Archive Services interfaces.</para>
