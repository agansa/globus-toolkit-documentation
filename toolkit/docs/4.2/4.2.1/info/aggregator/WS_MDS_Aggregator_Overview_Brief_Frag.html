<p>The WS-MDS Aggregator is the software framework on which WS-MDS services
(currently, the WS-MDS Index and WS-MDS Trigger services) are built.  The
aggregator framework collects data from an <i>aggregator source</i> and sends
that data to an <i>aggregator sink</i> for processing.  Aggregator sources
distributed with the Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data,
acquire data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to generate
data.  Aggregator sinks include modules that implement the WS-MDS Index service
interface and the WS-MDS Trigger service interface.</p>

<p>The Aggregator module consists of an Aggregating ServiceGroup framework which supports an extensible plugin architecture.</p>

<p>The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework is designed to facilitate the collecting
  of information from or about WS-Resources via plugin aggregator sources and
the feeding of that information to plugin aggregator  sinks.</p>

<p>Resources may be registered to an aggregating ServiceGroup using the ServiceGroup add operation. Each registration will be represented as a ServiceGroupEntry resource. When a registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks will be informed and aggregated data from the registered resource will begin to flow via the aggregation source into the aggregation sink.</p>

<p>The method of collection by source and processing by the sink is dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator framework.</p>
