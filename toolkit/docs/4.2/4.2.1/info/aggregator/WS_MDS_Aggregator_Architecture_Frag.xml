    <para>The WS MDS Aggregator Framework is the software framework on which WS MDS
        services are built. The Aggregator Framework collects data from an
        <emphasis>aggregator source</emphasis> and sends that data to an <emphasis>aggregator
            sink</emphasis> for processing. Aggregator sources distributed with the
        Globus Toolkit include modules that query resource properties, acquire
        data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to
        generate data. Another way of describing the Aggregator Framework is that it is designed to facilitate the
        collecting of information from or about WS-Resources via plugin
        aggregator sources and the feeding of that information to plugin
        aggregator sinks, which can then perform actions such as
        re-publishing, logging, or archiving the information.</para>

            <para>Aggregators work on a type of service group called an
                <command>AggregatorServiceGroupRP</command>. Resources may be
                <emphasis>registered</emphasis> to an AggregatorServiceGroupRP using the service
                group <computeroutput>add</computeroutput> operation, which will cause an entry to be
                added to the service group. The entry will include configuration
                parameters for the aggregator source; when the registration is
                made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks will be
                informed; the aggregator source will begin collecting data and
                inserting it into the corresponding service group entry, and the
                aggregator sink will begin processing the information in the
                service group entries.</para>

                <para>The method of collection by source and processing by the sink is
                    dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator
                    framework.</para>
