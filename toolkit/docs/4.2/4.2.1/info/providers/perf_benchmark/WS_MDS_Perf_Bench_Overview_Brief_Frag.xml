    The basic idea of this Information Provider is to allow a set of performance benchmarks to be run and to aggregate the results of the test back into the MDS4 Index Service. 
    To do this, each test must be configured separately, and each set of results will be placed in a separate Resource Property (RP). This simplifies the configuration and 
    allows for easy client side querying of the resuts of an individual test.

    This information provider also includes a "Hello, World!" test that you should use alone to make sure that your environment is configured properly so that the other 
    (more complicated) tests might have a chance of working as well.
