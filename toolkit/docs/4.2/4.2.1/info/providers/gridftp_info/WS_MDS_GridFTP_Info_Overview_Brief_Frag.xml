<!-- This is where you describe the information provider (pulled into both the release notes and the reference page). 
This should be simply one paragraph, so paste your text in between the para tags below. -->

<para> This provider connects to a GridFTP server, reads its banner, and puts the banner in the
    Index Service. If the connection cannot be made in 30 seconds or some other error occurs, the
    server is marked as down. This provider is an execution aggregator provider. These providers are
    quite useful as is and additionally serve as an example of how to create others. The perl script
    and configuration file can be modified to the user's liking once installed. This provider has a
    perl script and an XML configuration file. The perl script is used to obtain information and
    formated the information into xml output. The output is written to stdout where it is gathered
    and put into the Index Service. The XML file is of a common format that is explained <olink
        targetdoc="indexDeveloper" targetptr="index-howto-nonws-infoprovider">here</olink>. After
    installing the package the xml configuration files will be copied to
        <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/default_providers/</filename> where the
    DefaultIndexService will find them and use them to register the provider. </para>
