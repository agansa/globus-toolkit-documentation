<!-- This is where you describe the information provider (pulled into both the release notes and the reference page). 
This should be simply one paragraph, so paste your text in between the para tags below. -->

<para> This information provider gathers data from a Nagios system and publishes it into the MDS4 in
    the standard GLUE schema. The Nagios MDS4 Information Provider gets its information directly
    from the Nagios v. 2.x <filename>status.dat</filename> file. (Support remains for the v 1.3
        <filename>status.log</filename> file in the form of the alternate script
        <filename>globus-mds-cluster-nagios1.3</filename>) It includes some custom plugins that
    return the data in a format that the information provider can use. The official Nagios site
    states the following: <blockquote>
        <simpara>Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of network problems
            before your clients, end-users or managers do. It has been designed to run under the
            Linux operating system, but works fine under most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring
            daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and services you specify using external plugins
            which return status information to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can
            send notifications out to administrative contacts in a variety of different ways (email,
            instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status information, historical logs, and reports
            can all be accessed via a web browser.</simpara>
