The GKrellm Information Provider monitors systems for 
statistics like memory usage, CPU load, network load and
disk load.  It does this by communicating with a GKrellmd server, 
which must be running on all of the machines which are to be
monitored.  This information provider will collect the data from
all specified gkrellmd servers, expose the collected data as 
a WSRF resource, and publish the resource to the Index Service.
