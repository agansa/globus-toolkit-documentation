<!-- This is where you describe the information provider (pulled into both the release notes and the reference page). 
This should be simply one paragraph, so paste your text in between the para tags below. -->

<para> This information provider is included in the GT4 toolkit and is used for reporting GLUE
    Computing Element (CE) information. The GLUE resource property (as used by GRAM) collects
    information from two sources: the scheduler and the cluster information system (for example
    Ganglia or Hawkeye). These will be merged to form a single output resource property in the GLUE
    schema. The official Ganglia site states the following: <blockquote>
        <para>Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing
            systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at
            federations of clusters. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data
            representation, XDR for compact,portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage
            and visualization</para>
    </blockquote> This provider publishes information such as the following: <itemizedlist>
