Hawkeye data about Condor pool resources using the XML mapping of the
    GLUE schema and reports it to a GRAM4 service, which publishes it as

The official Condor site states the following: "Hawkeye utilizes the
technologies already present in Condor and ClassAds to provide rich
mechanisms for collecting, storing, and using information about
computers. A Hawkeye system can be used to monitor various attributes
of a collection of systems. The monitoring mechanism may also be used
then to further the management of systems."

This information includes: basic host data (name, ID), processor
information, memory size , OS name and version, file system data,
processor load data, other basic Condor host data.
