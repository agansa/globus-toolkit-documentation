<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>yThere are two
programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service:  information is collected
using an Aggregator Source and acted upon by an executable program.</p>
<p>There is no "client" interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
will later be read by some other program).</p>
