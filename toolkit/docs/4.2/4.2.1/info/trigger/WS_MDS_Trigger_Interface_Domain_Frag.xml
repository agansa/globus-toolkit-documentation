<section><title>Interface introduction</title>
<para>The trigger service provides an API to action scripts, which 
are executed when trigger rules fire. These take the form of 
fork-exec executables (written in any language) which are 
supplied with rule information on stdin and must output status
information on stdout.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Syntax of the interface</title>
<para>Trigger action scripts take the form of native OS executables, and
so can be written in any language that can generate such (for example,
bash, PERL, C).
</para>

<para>Information on the match that caused an action to fire is fed 
into the action script through <computeroutput>stdin</computeroutput>. Status information 
from the action script should be sent to <computeroutput>stdout</computeroutput>, and 
will reported in the content of the ServiceGroupEntry for the rule.
</para>

</section>

    &lt;/MemberEPR&gt;

    &lt;AggregatorConfig&gt;
 The aggregator configuration element for this rule.
    &lt;/AggregatorConfig&gt;
  &lt;/fire&gt;
</screen>

<para>
   The presence of the <glossterm linkend="aggregator-framework">aggregator framework</glossterm> configuration element allows for
additional parameters to be passed to the action script in 
registrations.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Format of action script stdout</title>

<para>The action script should output an XML document to stdout. The
