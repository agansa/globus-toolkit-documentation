<h3>Interface introduction</h3>
<p>The trigger service provides an API to action scripts, which 
are executed when trigger rules fire. These take the form of 
fork-exec executables (written in any language) which are 
supplied with rule information on stdin and must output status
information on stdout.

<h3>Syntax of the interface</h3>
<p>The syntax of this interface is documented in the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/trigger/developer/">Trigger
Service Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
