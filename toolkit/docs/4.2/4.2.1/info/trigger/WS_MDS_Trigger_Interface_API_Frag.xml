<para>There are two
programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service:  information is collected
    using an <glossterm linkend="aggregator-source">Aggregator Source</glossterm> and acted upon by an executable program.</para>
    <para> Information about how to configure existing
        aggregator sources (such as the aggregator sources distributed with
        the Globus Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource
        property information, one that collects resource property
        information through subscription/notification, and one that
        collects information by executing an executable program) is found
        in <xref linkend="aggregator-sources"/>; information about how to
        create new aggregator sources can be found in <xref linkend="aggregator-developer"/>.</para>
<para>There is no "client" interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
will later be read by some other program).</para>
