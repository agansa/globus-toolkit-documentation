<section id="whatistesting"><title>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </title>
<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </para>

<para>
Many interesting/hard-to-diagnose bugs previously found in MDS components have
been discovered in large-scale wide-area testing in the presence of
unexpected failure conditions (for example, network failures or resource
failure). Such conditions are difficult to recreate in a restricted
testing environment.
