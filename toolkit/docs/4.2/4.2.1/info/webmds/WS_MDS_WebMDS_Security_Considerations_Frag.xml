<para>By default, the WebMDS plugins distributed as part of the Toolkit
do not use authentication credentials -- they retrieve information using anonymous SSL authentication or no authentication
at all, and thus retrieve only
publicly-available information.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>ResourcePropertyNodeSource</computeroutput>
and <computeroutput>ResourcePropertyQueryNodeSource</computeroutput>
plugins can be configured either to allow users to specify
what resources they want to query or to only allow users to query resources
pre-configured by the web administrator.  The standard WebMDS
deployment allows users to specify the resources they want to query;
to disallow this (for example, to ensure that people don't use your
site's bandwidth to view information about some other site's services),
remove the files <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds/conf/openEndedRP</computeroutput>
and <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds/conf/openEndedQuery</computeroutput>.
