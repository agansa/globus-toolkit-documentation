  <title>Summary of Changes in UsefulRP</title>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>The RPProvider configuration file format has changed slighty.    
        The <computeroutput>ResourcePropertyProviderConfigArray</computeroutput> 
        structure contains an array of xml elements of the type 
        <computeroutput>resourcePropertyProviderConfig</computeroutput>. 
        In 4.0.x, the element name for each array item was "configArray";
        in 4.2.x, the name has been changed to "resourcePropertyProviderConfiguration".        
      </simpara>
      <simpara>  
        Structurally, the <computeroutput>ResourcePropertyProviderConfigArray</computeroutput> and its 
        child elements have not been modified in any other way.  Therefore, a search 
        and replace for all instances of "configArray" with "resourcePropertyProviderConfiguration" 
        should be all that is necessary to make 4.0.x RPProvider configuration files 
        compatible with 4.2.x versions.
