<para>Although the basic functionality remains the same for MDS in GT4,
the architecture, standards used, and implementation have changed
significantly in GT2.  The following table shows a mapping of some
GT2 concepts to GT4 concepts.</para>

<entry>Index registration mechanism</entry>
<entry>MDS servers (GRIS's and, in some cases, GIIS's) register themselves
with a GIIS.  An MDS server is configured to register itself to a remote
index by editing the local MDS server's
<computeroutput>grid-info-resource-register.conf</computeroutput> file, providing
information about the location of the remote index to register to
and timeout values for the registration</entry>
<entry>WS MDS Index servers maintain aggregating service groups that
include registration information (timeout values, the mechanism to
use to acquire information, and additional mechanism-specific parameters)
The registration is accomplished by
adding an entry to an aggregating service group via the 
<computeroutput>mds-servicegroup-add</computeroutput> command.    In addition, services
may be configured to register themselves to the default index server
running in the same container.</entry>

<entry>Mechanism used by an index to collect information</entry>
<entry>GIIS's send LDAP queries to remote serves.</entry>
<entry>WS MDS Index servers use a plugin-based architecture
to support several mechanisms to collect information.
The Globus Toolkit supplies plugins that support collecting
information via polling (resource property queries),
subscription/notification, and by program execution.</entry>
