Make subscription lifetime bound by "parent".

The meaning of a subscription and the resulting notification stream is
only defined by its relationship to a resource being monitored, so
there is no reason for subscriptions to outlive this parent.  By
implementing "chained" termination, we can reduce the footprint of the
container without requiring more termination messaging overhead from
clients.

Add efficient timed-wait RP query interface across all services (core
change?).

</td>
<td>

An alternate solution to (17) using what has been referred to in
OGSA/OGSI discussions as "one shot subscriptions".  Instead of
maintaining subscription resources to request asynchronous
notification, an operation request is left "open" so that the
asynchronous response can be issued in the response message. The
recipient can retry on failure and prevent indefinite hanging. Whether
this is more or less efficient or scalable depends on many underlying
container and binding-level details.

components can reduce this effect to the minimum required for safe
function.
