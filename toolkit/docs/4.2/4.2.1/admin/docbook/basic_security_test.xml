	<section id="gtadmin-basic-host"><title>Obtain host certificates</title>
		<!-- this is where preswsaa (GSI) config and env variables come in - but not really necessary at this point?? do most people already know??  -->
		<para>You must have X509 certificates to use the GT &shortversion; software securely (referred
			to in this documentation as <emphasis>host certificates</emphasis>). For an overview of
			certificates for GSI (security) see <xref linkend="prewsaa-config">GSI Configuration Information</xref>
			and <xref linkend="prewsaa-env">GSI Environmental Variables</xref>.</para>
		<para>Host certificates must:</para>

					computer.</simpara></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>You have the following options:</para>
		<section id="gtadmin-basic-existing"><title> Request a certificate from an existing CA</title>
			<para>Your best option is to use an already existing CA. You may have access to
				one from the company you work for or an organization you are affiliated with.
				Some universities provide certificates for their members and affiliates. Contact
				your support organization for details about how to acquire a certificate. You
				may find your CA listed in the <ulink
					url="http://www.tacar.org/">TERENA
					Repository</ulink>. </para>
			<para>If you already have a CA, you will need to follow their configuration directions.
				If they include a CA setup package, follow the CAs instruction on how to
				install the setup package. If they do not, you will need to create an 
				<filename class="directory">/etc/grid-security/certificates</filename> directory
				and include the CA cert and signing policy in that directory. See <ulink
					url="&docpath;security/prewsaa/admin-index.html#id2828765">Configuring
					a Trusted CA</ulink> for more details. </para>
			<para>This type of certificate is best for service deployment and Grid inter-operation. </para>
		</section>
		<section id="gtadmin-basic-simpleca"><title>SimpleCA</title><!-- will point to appendix? -->
			<para>SimpleCA provides a wrapper around the OpenSSL CA functionality and is sufficient
				for simple Grid services. Alternatively, you can use OpenSSL's <command>CA.sh</command> command
				on its own. Instructions on how to use the SimpleCA can be found in <xref linkend="simpleca"/>.  </para>
			<para>SimpleCA is suitable for testing or when a certificate authority is not available.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gtadmin-basic-gcs"><title>Low-trust certificate</title>
			<para>Globus offers a low-trust certificate available at <ulink
					url="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs">http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs</ulink>. This
				option should only be used as a last resort because it does not fulfill some
				of the duties of a real Certificate Authority. </para>
			<para>This type of certificate
				is best suited for short term testing. </para>

	<section id="gtadmin-basic-containercert"><title>Make the host credentials accessible by the container</title>
		<para>The host key (<filename>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</filename>) is only readable
			to root. The <glossterm>container</glossterm> (hosting environment provided by Java WS Core) will be running as a non-root
			user (probably the <replaceable>globus</replaceable> user) and in order to have a set of host credentials
			which are readable by the container, we need to copy the host certificate and
			key and change the ownership to the container user. </para>
		<note><para>This step assumes you have obtained a signed host certificate from your
				CA.</para></note>
                <para>As root, run:</para>
 
<screen>root# cd /etc/grid-security
root# cp hostkey.pem containerkey.pem
root# cp hostcert.pem containercert.pem
root# chown globus.globus containerkey.pem containercert.pem</screen>
		<para>At this point the certificates in <filename class="directory">/etc/grid-security</filename> should look something
			like:</para>
<screen>root# ls -l *.pem
-rw-r--r-- 1 globus globus 1785 Oct 14 14:47 containercert.pem

		<para>Add authorizations for users:</para>
		<para>Create <filename class="directory">/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</filename> as root. </para>
		<para>You need two pieces of information:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>the subject name of a user</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>the account name it should map to.</simpara></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>The syntax is one line per user, with the certificate subject followed by
			the user account name. </para>
		<para>Run <command>grid-cert-info</command> to get your subject name, and <command>whoami</command> to
			get the account name:</para>
<screen>bacon$ grid-cert-info -subject
/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov/OU=mcs.anl.gov/CN=Charles Bacon
bacon$ whoami

		<para>You may add the line by running the following as root:</para>
<screen>root# $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-add-entry -dn \
"/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov/OU=mcs.anl.gov/CN=Charles Bacon" \
-ln bacon</screen>
		<para>The corresponding line in the <filename>grid-mapfile</filename> should look like:</para>
<screen>&quot;/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov/OU=mcs.anl.gov/CN=Charles Bacon&quot; <replaceable>bacon</replaceable></screen>
		<important><simpara>The quotes around the subject name are <emphasis>important</emphasis>, because it contains

	<section id="gtadmin-basic-verify"><title>Verify Basic Security</title>
		 <para>Now that you have installed a trusted CA, acquired
			 a hostcert and acquired a usercert, you may verify that
			 your security setup is complete.  As your user
			 account, run the following command:
		 </para>
<screen>bacon$ grid-proxy-init -verify -debug

User Cert File: /home/bacon/.globus/usercert.pem
User Key File: /home/bacon/.globus/userkey.pem

Trusted CA Cert Dir: /etc/grid-security/certificates

Output File: /tmp/x509up_u506
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Charles Bacon 332900
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ...++++++++++++
..................++++++++++++
 Done
Proxy Verify OK
Your proxy is valid until: Fri Jan 28 23:13:22 2005</screen>
		<para>
			There are a few things you can notice from this command.
			Your usercert and key are located in
			<filename class="directory">$HOME/.globus/</filename>.
			The proxy certificate is created in
			<filename class="directory">/tmp/</filename>.
			The "up" stands for "user proxy", and the
			<replaceable>_u506</replaceable> will be your
			UNIX userid.  It also prints out your
			distinguished name (DN), and the proxy is valid
			for 12 hours.
		</para>
		<para>
			If this command succeeds, your single node
			is correctly configured.
