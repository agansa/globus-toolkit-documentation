                <screen>globus$ make</screen>
                <para> Note that this command can take several hours to complete. If you wish to
                    have a log file of the build, use <command>tee</command>: </para>

                <para> The syntax above assumes a Bourne shell. If you are using another shell,
                    redirect stderr to stdout and then pipe it to <command>tee</command>. </para>

                    <simpara>Using make in parallel mode (-j) is not entirely safe, and is not

                <screen>globus$ make install</screen>
                <para> This completes your installation. Now you may move on to the configuration
                    sections of the following chapters. </para>
                <para> We recommend that you install any security advisories available for your
                    installation, which are available from the <ulink
                        url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/advisories.html"> Advisories
                    page</ulink>. You may also be interested in subscribing to some <ulink
                        url="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists">mailing lists</ulink> for
                    general discussion and security-related announcements. </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <!-- add note for custom install - you can build only certain components by using make <package> blah blah
        and then olink to packing appendix (which needs more gridftp targets)-->
        <para> Your next step is to setup security, which includes picking a CA to trust, getting
            host certificates, user certificates, and creating a grid-mapfile. The next three
            chapters cover these topics. </para>
        <para> With security setup, you may start a GridFTP server, configure a database for RFT,
            and configure WS-GRAM. You may also start a GSI-OpenSSH daemon, setup a MyProxy server,
            run RLS, and use CAS. The following chapters will explain how to configure these
            technologies. If you follow the chapters in order, you will make sure of performing
            tasks in dependency order. </para>
