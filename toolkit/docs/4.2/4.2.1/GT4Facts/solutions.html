<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>



<p> Although every Grid application and system is unique, there are some things
  that they typically have in common. To meet these common needs, the Globus
  Alliance and the Grid community have identified a number of "integrated solutions" that
  combine components from the <a href="http://www-unix.grids-center.org/r6/ecosystem/">Grid
  Ecosystem</a> with specialized code. These solutions can be reused to ease
the work of developing new applications and systems. </p>



<h2>Current List of Known GT Solutions</h2>
<p>While we are still testing solutions for GT4, most of the following solutions
  are implemented in GT3: </p>
<ul>

   <li>  <strong><a href="http://www.grids-center.org/solutions/purse/">PURSE</a></strong> combines
       several Grid security components and a Web portal to provide an easy way
       for new users to sign up to use Grid applications on the Web. Using a
       Web browser and email, users can establish a sign-on for their application
   and then use sophisticated Grid-enabled software with high-quality security.</li>

   <li>     <strong><a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/">VOMRS</a></strong> combines
         security components from the Physics community to provide a Web-based
         registration form for people who already have Grid credentials. VOMRS
         also includes a group membership capability that can be used by the
     application to make authorization decisions.</li>
   <li>The <strong><a href="http://www-unix.grids-center.org/r6/ecosystem/monitoring/esg-monitoring.php">ESG
               Monitoring System</a></strong> links system monitoring tools together
               to provide a service that keeps track of the critical components
               that make up the Earth System Grid (ESG), notifies system administrators
               if a critical service fails, and records availability of the services
             over time for later analysis.</li>
   <li>The <strong><a href="http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/LDR/">Lightweight
                   Data Replicator</a></strong> combines data management tools
                   to create an easy-to-use tool for system managers to create
                   replicas of large datasets on multiple servers while keeping
                   track of where the replicas are and ensuring that each replica
   site has all of the necessary files.</li>
   <li><strong><a href="http://www.griphyn.org/chimera/">GriPhyN Virtual Data System</a></strong> combines
                 data management and virtual data tools into a powerful data
     processing system. Pegasus accepts application-level requests for data and
  uses a metadata catalog, a virtual data catalog, a workflow engine, and Grid
                 data and computation services to provide the requested data
     with minimal processing.</li>
</ul>
