<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction to Globus Toolkit 4.0 </h2>
<p>[add some context with a reference to Grids in the first place: The biggest
  challenge in Grid computing is getting a large number of different resources
  that use different protocols and different languages to communicate... Globus
  Toolkit (GT) is a collection of middleware tools that can be used to build
  a Grid that talks securely to all the Grid resources and manages them within
an infrastructure that all parties can &quot;trust&quot;] </p>
<p>GT  has been developed since the late 1990s to support
  the development of service-oriented distributed applications and infrastructures.
  Core GT components address basic issues relating to security, resource access
  and management, data movement and management, resource discovery, and so forth.
  Other projects have contributed to a broader Globus structure of tools and
  components that build on core GT functionality to provide many useful application-level
  functions. These tools have been used to develop a wide variety of Grid systems
and applications.</p>
<p>Version 4 of the Globus Toolkit, GT 4.0, released in early 2005, represents
  a significant advance relative to earlier releases in terms of the range of
  components provided, functionality, standards conformance, usability, and quality
  of documentation. This document provides an introduction to key features of
  GT4.0 and associated tools, and the ways in which these components can be used
  to develop Grid infrastructures and applications.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>...</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>This section contains commonly used terms that you'll find throughout the
  GT 4.0 documentation: </p>
<p>Grid resources</p>
<p>web services</p>
<p>hosting environment - aka container</p>
<p>virtual organization (VO) </p>
<p>resource properties </p>
<p>services</p>
<h2>Grid development process</h2>
<p>...</p>
<h2>GT4 architecture</h2>
<p>[describe architecture - high level]</p>
<p>[diagram]</p>
<h3>Default GT4 services and other components</h3>
<p>Nine GT4 services implement Web services (WS) interfaces: </p>
<ul>
  <li>job management (GRAM)</li>
  <li>reliable file transfer (RFT)</li>
  <li> delegation</li>
  <li> index</li>
  <li>trigger</li>
  <li> WebMDS</li>
  <li> community authorization (CAS)</li>
  <li> OGSA-DAI data access and integration</li>
  <li> GTCP Grid 
    TeleControl Protocol for online control of instrumentation</li>
</ul>
<p> Of these, WebMDS,
    GTCP, and OGSA-DAI are &ldquo;tech previews,&rdquo; meaning that their interface
  and implementation is likely to change in the future. </p>
<p>For two of those services, GRAM and Index, pre-WS &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; implementations
  are provided. They will be deprecated at some future time as experience is
gained with WS implementations.</p>
<p>For three additional GT4 services, WS interfaces are not yet provided (but
  will be in the future): </p>
<ul>
  <li>GridFTP data transport</li>
  <li> replica location service (RLS)</li>
  <li> MyProxy online credential repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Other libraries implement various security functionality, while the eXtensible
  I/O (XIO) library provides convenient access to a variety of underlying transport
  protocols. </p>
<p>SimpleCA is a lightweight certification authority.</p>
<h3>Building custom services: Web Services infrastructure</h3>
<p>Also provide APIs and libraries that allow developers to write their own services.
  Available in Java, C and Python: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Java WS Core</li>
  <li>C WS Core</li>
  <li>Python WS Core </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to its predefined services, GT4 provides libraries and tools to
  assist with the development of custom Web services (the white boxes in the &ldquo;server&rdquo; domain)
in Java, Python, and C.</p>
<p>The <strong>Java WS Core</strong> </p>
<p>supports the development of Web services
  and clients written in Java that execute on standard Apache Axis (in either
  Tomcat or a lightweight &ldquo;Globus container&rdquo;), </p>
<p>with GT-supplied libraries
    and handlers available for security, WSRF, and/or WS-Notification behaviors,
  if desired. </p>
<p>Other features include an Apache Tomcat-based JNDI registry,
    HTTP/1.1 client server support, and a resolver service for URI to WS-Addressing
    conversion.</p>
<p>The <strong>Python WS Core</strong> </p>
<p>supports the development of Web services
  and clients written in Python that conform to WSRF and WS-Notification and
  use WS-Security. </p>
<p>(This software builds on the Twisted container and GT4
    libraries.) </p>
<p>The <strong>C WS Core</strong> </p>
<p>provides a basic toolset for creating Web services
  and clients in C conforming to WSRF and WS-Notification and using WS-Security.</p>
<p> These tools can be used, for example, to make a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; application &ldquo;steerable&rdquo; by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> exposing some state as WSRF resource properties, </li>
  <li>or to extend a resource
        manager to provide WSRF-compliant WS interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Globus structure </h2>
<p>[elaborate on the families and how they work together and with other Grid
  software]</p>
<p>GT4 components do not, in general, address end-user needs directly: </p>
<p>they are
  more akin to a TCP/IP library or Web server implementation rather than a Web
  browser./ GT4 components are to end results as a TCP/IP library or Web server
  implementation is to a Web browser. </p>
<p>Instead, GT4 enables a range of end-user components and tools that provide
  higher-level capabilities attuned to the needs of specific user communities.</p>
<p>These components and tools constitute, together with GT4 itself, the &ldquo;Globus
  structure.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We introduce here some of its principal elements.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, we assign each Globus structure component
  to one of the following classes.</p>

<p>[diagram]</p>
<h3>Execution management tools </h3>
<p>Execution management tools are concerned with the initiation, monitoring,
  management, scheduling, and/or coordination of remote computations. GT4 supports
  the Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM) interface as a basic mechanism
  for these purposes. Its GRAM server is typically deployed in conjunction with
  Delegation and GridFTP servers to address data staging, delegation of proxy
credentials, and computation monitoring and management in an integrated manner.</p>
<p>Associated tools fall into three main classes. First, we have GRAM-enabled
  schedulers for clusters or other computers on a local area network (Condor,
  OpenPBS, Torque, PBSPro, SGE, LSF). Second, we have systems that provide different
  interfaces to remote computers (OpenSSH) or that implement various parallel
  programming models in Grid environments by using GRAM to dispatch tasks to
  remote computers (Condor-G, DAGman, MPICH-G2, GriPhyN VDS, Nimrod-G). Third,
  we have various &ldquo;meta-schedulers&rdquo; that map different tasks to different
  clusters (CSF, Maui).</p>
<h3>Data management tools </h3>
<p>Data management tools are concerned with the location, transfer, and management
  of distributed data. GT4 provides a variety of basic tools, including GridFTP
  for high-performance and reliable data transport, RLS for maintaining location
  information for replicated files, and OGSA-DAI for accessing and integrated
structured and semistructured data.</p>
<p>Associated tools enhance GT4 components by addressing storage reservation
  (NeST), providing a command-line client for GridFTP (UberFTP), providing a
  uniform interface to distributed data (SRB), and supporting distributed data
  processing pipelines (DataCutter, STORM).</p>
<p>Other interesting systems include the LBNL Storage Resource Manager (SRM),
  which provides for GSI-authenticated GridFTP access to managed storage, and
  GridNFS, a GSI-enabled implementation of NSFv4 being developed at U.Michigan.</p>
<p>See also: GriPhyN VDS (Execution).</p>
<h3>Interface tools</h3>
<p>Grid portal and user interface tools support the construction of graphical
  user interfaces for invoking, monitoring, and/or managing activities involving
Grid resources. </p>
<p>Many (but not all) of these tools are concerned with enabling access to Grid
  systems from Web browsers. Many (but not all) of such Web browser-oriented
  systems are based on a three-tier architecture, in which a middle-tier <em>portal
  server</em> (e.g., uPortal with Tomcat, or GridSphere) hosts JSR 168-compliant <em>portlets</em> that
  both (a) generate the various elements of the first-tier Web interface with
  which users interact and (b) interact with third-tier Grid resources and services.</p>
<h3>Security tools </h3>
<p>Security tools are concerned with establishing the identity of users or services
  (authentication), protecting communications, and determining who is allowed
  to perform what actions (authorization), as well as with supporting functions
such as managing user credentials and maintaining group membership information.</p>
<p>GT4 provides distinct WS and pre-WS authentication and authorization capabilities.
  Both build on the same base, namely standard X.509 end entity certificates
  and proxy certificates, which are used to identify persistent entities such
  as users and servers and to support the temporary delegation of privileges
  to other entities, respectively.</p>
<p>GT4&rsquo;s WS security [1] comprises (a) <em>Message-Level Security</em> mechanisms,
  which implement the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation specification
  to provide message protection for GT4&rsquo;s SOAP messages, and (b) an <em>Authorization
  Framework</em> that allows for a variety of authorization schemes, including
  a &ldquo; grid-mapfile&rdquo; access control list , an access control list
  defined by a service, a custom authorization handler, and access to an authorization
  service via the SAML protocol. For non-WS components, GT4 provides similar
  authentication, delegation, and authorization mechanisms, although with fewer
  authorization options.</p>
<p>Associated security tools provide variously for the storage of X.509 credentials
  (MyProxy, Delegation), the mapping between GSI and other authentication mechanisms
  (e.g., KX509 and PKINIT for Kerberos, MyProxy for one-time passwords), and
  maintenance of information used for authorization (VOMS, GUMS, PERMIS). Likely
  also to be of interest in the future is work underway in the UK and US to integrate
  Grid security with Shibboleth, enabling access to campus directories. </p>

<h3>Information services tools</h3>
<p>[for next release: make this info a &quot;family&quot; level frag - then we can plug
  them in here AND at the component-level --Cris] </p>
<p>Information services tools help with obtaining, distributing,
indexing, and otherwise processing information about  Grid resources. Collecting
  this information enables discovery of available Grid resources and monitoring
  of the status of Grid resources throughout a VO. </p>
<p>GT4&rsquo;s support in its Java, C, and Python WS Core for WSRF and
  WS-Notification interfaces enables such monitoring and discovery because it
  allows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the definition of  resource properties</li>
  <li>pull- and push-mode access to Grid resources. </li>
</ul>
<p>GT4 services such as GRAM and
      RFT  define appropriate resource properties, which will make them available
  for discovery and monitoring by Information services tools by default. </p>
<p>As well, other GT4 services are intended to be designed for GT 4.0 to enable
  both </p>
<ul>
  <li>discovery and monitoring, and </li>
  <li> indexing, archiving, and analysis of data for significant events.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the documentation for Information services components <a href="../info/">here</a>. </p>
<h4>[<strong>Java, C and Python WS Cores</strong></h4>
<p> Implements WSRF and WS-Notification specifications,
    thus allowing Web services to define, and allow access to, resource properties.
    Container incorporates a local index, enabling discovery of services. This
    is an integrated GT4 component and is a staple of many Grid deployments] </p>
<h4>MDS-Index service</h4>
<?php
include_once( "./../info/index/WS_MDS_Index_Overview_Brief_Frag.html" );
?> 
<p>This is an integrated
  GT4 component and has some amount of promising deployment. </p>
<h4>MDS-Trigger service</h4>
<p>
  <?php
include_once( "./../info/trigger/WS_MDS_Trigger_Overview_Brief_Frag.html" );
?>
</p>
<p>This is an integrated
      GT4 component and has some amount of promising deployment. </p>
<h4>MDS-Archive service (in development) </h4>
<p> The MDS-Archive service is still under development and is intended to collect
  a historical record of monitoring data from registered Grid resources, 
making that record available for query through a Web Services API. </p>
<p>Currently under development, this will be an integrated GT4 component. Even
so, it already  has some amount of promising deployment.</p>
<h4>Aggregator framework</h4>
<p> 
  <?php
include_once( "./../info/aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Overview_Brief_Frag.html" );
?>
</p>
<p>This is an integrated
      GT4 component and has some amount of promising deployment. </p>
<h4>Associated tools </h4>
<p>Associated tools include those that monitor individual entities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#"><strong>Hawkeye</strong></a> - Monitors individual clusters, using
    Condor as a base. GT4 includes data provider that makes status information
    available in GLUE schema. This is an external component already compatible
    with the GT4 release and a staple in many Grid deployments. </li>
  <li> <a href="#"><strong>Ganglia</strong></a> - Monitors individual clusters
    and sets of clusters. GT4 includes data provider that makes status information
      available in GLUE schema. This is an external component already compatible
      with the GT4 release and a staple in many Grid deployments. </li>
  <li><a href="#"><strong>Inca</strong></a> - Monitors services in a distributed
    system by performing a set of specified tests at specified intervals; publish
    results of these tests. This is an external component expected to be compatible
      with the GT4 release soon and has some amount of promising deployment.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#">NetLogger</a></strong> - Generates, collects, and analyzes
    high frequency data from distributed system components. This is an external
    component expected to be compatible with the GT4 release soon and is a staple
    of many Grid deployments.</li>
  <li>Big Brother? </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging and distribution tools</h3>
<p>?</p>
<h3>Other tools</h3>
<p>? </p>
<p>In practice, many tools fit multiple classes. For example, the GriPhyN virtual
  data system addresses both execution and data management, while the OGCE portal
  toolkit encompasses elements of all classes.</p>
