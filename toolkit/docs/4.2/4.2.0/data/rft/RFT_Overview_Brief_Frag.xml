<para>The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) Service implementation in GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> uses standard
  SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd party GridFTP transfers
  and deletion of files and directories using GridFTP. The service also provides an interface to control various 
    transfer parameters of the GridFTP control channel like TCP buffer size, parallel streams, DCAU etc. The user creates a RFT resource by submitting
  a Transfer Request (consisting of a set of third-party gridftp transfers) to the RFT Factory service.
  The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and authenticated.
  RFT service implementation exposes operations to control and manage the transfers
  (the resource). The resource the user created exposes the
  state of the transfer as a resource property to which the user can either subscribe
  for changes or poll for the changes in state periodically using standard WS-RF command
  line clients and other resource properties. </para>
