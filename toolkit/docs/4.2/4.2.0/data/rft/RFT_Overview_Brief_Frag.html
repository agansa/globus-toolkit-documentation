<p>The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) Service implementation in 4.0 uses standard
  SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd party GridFTP transfers
  and to delete files using GridFTP. The user creates a RFT resource by submitting
  a list of URL pairs of files that need to be transferred/deleted to RFT Factory
  service. The user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user
  is creating to a GT 3.9.3 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
  The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and authenticated.
  RFT service implementation exposes operations to control and manage the transfers
  (the resource). The operations exposed by both RFT factory and RFT service
  are briefly described below. The resource the user created also exposes the
  state of the transfer as a resource property to which the user can either subscribe
  for changes or poll for the changes in state periodically using standard command
  line clients. </p>
