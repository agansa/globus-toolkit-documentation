We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve
the GRAM component.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable this feature, please
see the Java WS Core System Adminstrator guide section on
<a href="../../../common/javawscore/admin/#usageStatisticsTargets">Usage
Statistics</a> for instructions.

Also, please see our policy statement on the collection of usage statistics.
