    <title>Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) Security Considerations</title>
    <section id="rft-security-considerations-permissions">
        <title>Permissions of service configuration files</title>
        <para> The service configuration files such as
            <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> and
            <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> (located under
                <computeroutput>etc/&lt;gar&gt;/</computeroutput> directory) contain private
            information such as database passwords and usernames. Ensure that these configuration
            files are only readable by the user that is running the container. </para>
        <para> The deployment process automatically sets the permissions of
                <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> and
                <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> as user readable only. However,
            this might not work correctly on all platforms and this does not apply to any other
            configuration files. </para>

    <section id="rft-security-considerations-dbaccess">
        <title>Access of information stored in the database</title>
        <para> RFT stores the transfer requests in a database. Proper security measures need to be
            taken to protect the access of the data by granting/revoking appropriate permissions on
            tables that are created for RFT use and other steps that are appropriate and consistent
            with site specific security measures. </para>

    <section id="rft-security-considerations-persistent-data">
        <title>Permissions of persistent data</title>
        <para> RFT uses the subscription persistence API from the GT4 core to store all of its
            subscription data under the <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted</computeroutput>
            directory. Ensure that the entire <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted</computeroutput>
            directory is only readable by the user running the container. </para>
