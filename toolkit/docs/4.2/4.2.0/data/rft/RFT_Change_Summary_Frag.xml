      <simpara>New in RFT 4.2 is a connection caching feature.
      This allows internal GridFTP connections to be internally
      cached globally across all service requests.  This has shown
      to be a vast performance increases in the cases where a single
      users wishes to transfer many URLs, but instead of transferring them
      in a single request, they put each in one request.  Cache helps
      this case specifically, and is a general optimization for other
      cases.

      <simpara>
        The backoff algorithm has been modified.  To start with, all errors
        in communicating with GridFTP servers are considered transient. In
        the past we considered authorization failures and DNS lookup
        failures, as well as other similar things as fatal.  We have since
        recognized that even those shall pass, and in some environments
        those should be expected as a means of controlling load.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
       Additionally how we back off is different.  If a failure is detected
       we do not try to communicate with the given GridFTP server for a
        specified amount of time, <emphasis>or</emphasis> until some
        other transfer completes successfully with that server.  This
        allows for optimal use of GridFTP servers that only allow a fixed
        number of connections at once, and it helps make optimal use of our
        connection cache.
