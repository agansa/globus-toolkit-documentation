  <entry><code>Error creating RFT Home: Failed to connect to database ... 
Until this is corrected all RFT request will fail and all GRAM jobs that require staging will fail</code></entry>
  <entry>This occurs when you start the container if RFT is not configured properly to talk to a PostgreSQL database.</entry>
  <entry>
The usual cause is that Postmaster is not accepting TCP connections, which means that you must restart Postmaster with the -i option (see <olink targetdoc="rftAdmin" targetptr="rft-configuring">Configuring RFT</olink>).

ERROR service.RFTResourceManager [Thread-13,transferCompleted:517] 
Unable to update on finished
org.globus.transfer.reliable.service.database.RftDBException: 
RFT database update error 
[Caused by: Syntax error: Encountered ")" at line 1, column 47.]
]]></code></entry>
  <entry>This error occurs a result of a dynamically built SQL 
update string.  The update occurs when a transfer completes. It is used to notify transfer requests 
using the same hosts that resources on that host have been freed.  The error message occurs when no rows 
in the database match that host.
</entry>
  <entry>
Users of RFT may safely ignore this error. The message is harmless to the functionality of RFT and will not affect the results of a transfer in 
any way.  The exception is safely caught.  Future versions of RFT will have optimizations to avoid this step.
