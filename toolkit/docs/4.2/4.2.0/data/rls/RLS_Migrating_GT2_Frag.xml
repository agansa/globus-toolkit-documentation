<para>Users of GT2 RLS must create the <glossterm baseform="Replica Location Index">RLI</glossterm> database, which was not required in some GT2 versions 
    of RLS. To create the RLI database run the RLI database script for your particular DBMS. See <olink targetdoc="rlsAdmin" targetptr="rls-admin-install-db">database configuration instructions</olink> for more details. This is only required if the RLS
is deployed as an RLI (e.g., <command>rls_server <replaceable>true</replaceable></command>).</para>
