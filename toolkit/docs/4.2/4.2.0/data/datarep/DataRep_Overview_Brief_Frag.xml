<para>The Data Replication Service (DRS) is provided with the Globus Toolkit
<replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> and first appeared in the GT
3.9.5 Beta release. The primary functionality of the component allows users to
identify a set of desired files existing in their Grid environment, to make
local replicas of those data files by transferring files from one or more
source locations, and to register the new replicas in a Replica Location
Service. The DRS conforms to the WS-RF specification and exposes a WS-Resource
(called a "Replicator" resource) which represents the current state of the
requested replication activity and allows users to query or subscribe to
various Resource Properties in order to monitor the state of the resource. The
DRS is built on the GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> Java
WS Core and uses the Globus RLS to locate and register replicas and the Globus
RFT to transfer files. <!-- [fixme] while coding howtos - i'm not sure where to code these 'actions' described in the overview:
 - finding where desired files are on the Grid
 - moving desired files to local storage
 - registering
  
 also wonder if any of the following need to be doc'd for developers (i got this from design doc, iirc). in other words, is the current info enough for
 developers to figure out how to set all this up?
discovery phase
 - accessing delegated credential
 - querying local index for LRCs
 - invoking catalog filter class
 - querying each remote catalog for PFNs
 - using source selector class to select desired files
xfer phase
 - using RFT to create RFT resource, start xfer, access credentials, set up file xfers
 - using GridFTP server to perform xfer
 - using replicator to check status of RFT resource and get status
 register phase
 - adding mappings for new replicas to local catalog (using replicator)
 - LRC updating local and remote indexes to show new replicas
