        <para>The DRS is a WS-RF compliant service implemented using the Globus Java WS Core. It
            exposes a set of Resource Properties and operations to allow users to create replication
            resources, control replication resources' lifecycle, and inspect the state of
            replication resources' activities along with the success or failure of individual
            replicated data sets. In this release, the WSDL and the command-line clients are the
            primary public interfaces for developers. Two java interfaces exist on the service-side
            to allow developers and users to modify the source selection behavior of the DRS. These
            interfaces allow users to chose alternate schemes to select sources beyond the random
            selection provided by default.</para>
