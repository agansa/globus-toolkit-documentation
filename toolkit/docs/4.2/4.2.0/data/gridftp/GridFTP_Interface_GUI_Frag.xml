    <para>Globus does not provide any interactive client for GridFTP, either GUI or text based.
        However, NCSA, as part of their TeraGrid activity, produces a text based interactive client
        called UberFTP, which you may want to check out. See <olink targetptr="globus-url-copy-interactiveclients"/> for more
        information. </para>
