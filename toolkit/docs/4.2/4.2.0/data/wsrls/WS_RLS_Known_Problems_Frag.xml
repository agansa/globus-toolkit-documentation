    <title>Limitations</title>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><simpara>At this time, WS RLS only supports a limited query response for WS-ReplicaLocationIndex (i.e., index) lookups. When querying the index for a given logical name (say 'my-logical-name-x1105') the response is the URL for the catalogs that contain entries corresponding to the logical name (say 'https://mycataloghost:8443'). The limitation to this interface is that the complete URL path is not included in the response. Only the scheme, hostname, and port of the URL are returned to the client. The client must append the remaining path to form the complete URL suitable for contacting the catalog (in this example 'https://mycataloghost:8443/wsrf/services/ReplicaLocationCatalogService').</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>At this time, dateTime attribute values are not supported. If you are interested in this feature, please contact us.</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>At this time, the command-line tools for the WS RLS do not support the documented '-' option, which is intended to allow for command-line parameters to be read from <computeroutput>stdin</computeroutput>.</simpara></listitem>
