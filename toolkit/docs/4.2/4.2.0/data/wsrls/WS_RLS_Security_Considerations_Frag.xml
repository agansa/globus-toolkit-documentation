      <listitem><simpara>THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH DESCRIBES OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS EARLY FORM OF WS RLS INTERFACE -- THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A FINAL SOLUTION. The WS RLS uses a single certificate and key file to identify itself to the RLS irregardless of the user accessing the WS RLS. Thus users that can access the WS RLS are given the fixed WS RLS identity to access the RLS. Users accustomed to using RLS may not feel comfortable with this approach -- Do not use it with your production RLS. It is not completely nonsensical. If you think of WS RLS as the gating interface to the RLS, as you should, then you should apply the appropriate authorization restrictions at the WS RLS level, which can be done using WSAA. This will in effect achieve a level of authorization similar to that of the RLS.</simpara></listitem>
