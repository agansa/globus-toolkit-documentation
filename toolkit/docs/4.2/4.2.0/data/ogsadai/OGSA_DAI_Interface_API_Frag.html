<p>[provide a programming model overview. you can check out the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/data/gridftp/GridFTP_Public_Interfaces.html#apis">gridftp
example</a>.]</p>
<h3>Component API</h3>
<ul>
<li>[most core components have autogenerated docs (javadocs, doxygen, etc) for
  their apis and this is where they link to them. don't know what the case is
  for you - if you have any api documentation, link to it here (even if it's
  outside the globus website) ] 
</ul>
