        <para>Archive Service queries are performed using resource property requests; consult <olink

        <para>The contents of an Archive are stored in a Xindice database and can be easily
            retrieved using the aggregator framework programming model (which can receive data from
            any <glossterm>aggregator source</glossterm>). Information about how to configure
            existing aggregator sources (such as the aggregator sources distributed with the Globus
            Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource property information, one that
            collects resource property information through subscription/notification, and one that
            collects information by executing an executable program) is found in the <olink
                targetdoc="aggregatorSources"/>; information about how to create new aggregator
            sources can be found in <olink targetdoc="aggregatorDeveloper"/>.</para>
