                            <simpara>Aggregated data is published through WS-Resource Properties
                                mechanisms</simpara>

                            <simpara>The <glossterm>Aggregator Framework</glossterm> module (basis
                                of the archive service) collects data from monitored resources using
                                WS-Resource Properties collection mechanisms, including the base
                                WS-Resource Properties poll operations and
                            WS-Notification.</simpara>

            <listitem>
                <simpara>Persistent configuration of aggregations has been refactored. The service
                    no longer has its own config file for specifying aggregations. Instead a
                    separate client is used to make appropriate registrations. This client may be
                    started alongside the container for the equivalent effect. The client may also
                    be deployed elsewhere to support resource-side configuration (providing similar
                    functionality to the GT3.2 RegistryPublishProvider) or at a third
                location.</simpara>

    <para>Other Supported Features <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <simpara>The archive appears as a ServiceGroup (defined in WSRF) which lists
                    registered resources alongside dynamically collected information from those
                    resources. This information can be examined using (for example) XPath queries to
                    discover resources that match desired constraints.</simpara>
