    This provider will monitor the life of a remote certificate. It connects to an SSL TCP
    listener and obtains the certificate from it. It then checks the certificate for subject, start
    date, end data, and email address. All of this information is put in the Index Service if it is
    successfully obtained. This provider is an execution aggregator provider. These providers are
    quite useful as is and additionally serve as an example of how to create others. The perl script
    and configuration file can be modified to the user's liking once installed. This provider has a
    perl script and an XML configuration file. The perl script is used to obtain information and
    format the information into XML output. The output is written to stdout, where it is gathered
    and put into the Index Service. The XML file is of a common format that is explained <olink
        targetdoc="indexDeveloper" targetptr="index-howto-nonws-infoprovider">here</olink>.  After
    installing the package, the XML configuration files will be copied to
        <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/default_providers/</filename> where the
        <computeroutput>DefaultIndexService</computeroutput> will find them and use them to register the provider. </para>
