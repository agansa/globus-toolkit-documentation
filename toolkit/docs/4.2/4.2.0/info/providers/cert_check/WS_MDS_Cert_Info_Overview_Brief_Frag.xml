This provider will monitor the life of a remote certificate.  It
connects to an ssl TCP listener and obtains the certificate from it.
If then checks the cert for subject, start date, end data, and email
address.  All of this information is put in the index if it is
successfully obtained.

are quite useful as is and additionally serve as an example of how to
create others.  The perl script and configuration file can be modified
to the users liking once installed.

the DefaultIndexService will find them and use them to register the
provider.
