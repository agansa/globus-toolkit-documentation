This information provider is included in the GT4 toolkit and is used
for reporting GLUE Computing Element (CE) information.  The GLUE
resource property (as used by GRAM) collects information from two
sources: the scheduler and the cluster information system (for example
Ganglia or Hawkeye).  These will be merged to form a single output
resource property in the GLUE schema.

The official Ganglia site states the following: "Ganglia is a scalable
distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems
such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design
targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used
technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact,
portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and
visualization"

This provider publishes information such as the following: basic host
data (name, ID), memory size, OS name and version, file system data,
processor load data, other basic cluster data.
