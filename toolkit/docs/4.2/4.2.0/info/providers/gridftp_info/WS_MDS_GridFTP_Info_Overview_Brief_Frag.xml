This provider connects to a gridftp server, reads its banner, and puts
the banner in the index.  If the connection cannot be made in 30
seconds, or some other error occurs the server is marked as down.

This provider is an execution aggregator provider.  These providers
are quite useful as is and additionally serve as an example of how to
create others.  The perl script and configuration file can be modified
to the users liking once installed.

This provider has a perl script and an xml configuration file.  The
perl script is used to obtain information and formated the information
into xml output.  The output is written to stdout where it is gathered
and put into the Index Service.  The xml file is of a common format
that is explained here:

<xref linkend="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#id2528218" />

After installing the package the xml configuration files will be
copied to
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/default_providers/ where
the DefaultIndexService will find them and use them to register the
provider.
