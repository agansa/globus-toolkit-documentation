  <listitem><simpara>The new Resource Property Information Provider API makes getting data into the MDS system easier than previous releases.  Implementing custom resource property information providers and integrating them into MDS is also much more flexible.  The API allows the developer of a custom resource property provider to leverage the framework so that it is necessary to focus only on the code or executable that forms the XML output for the resource property, and not have to spend time implementing compulsory resource property access methods.  Resource Properties implemented using the RPProvider API can be accessed via by both the standard GT4 WSRF query and subscription interfaces, subject to the implementation of the hosting service.</simpara></listitem>
