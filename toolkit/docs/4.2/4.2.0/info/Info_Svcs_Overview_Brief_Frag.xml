<para>The Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS) is a suite of web services to monitor and discover resources and 
  services on Grids. This system allows users to discover what resources are considered part of a Virtual Organization (VO) 
  and to monitor those resources. MDS services provide query and subscription interfaces to arbitrarily detailed resource data 
  and a trigger interface that can be configured to take action when pre-configured trouble conditions are met.</para>
