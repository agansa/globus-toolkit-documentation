<p>There is no GUI specifically for the aggregator framework. The release contains
   <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/webmds/index.html">WebMDS</a>
   which can be used to display monitoring information in a web browser. 
   Specifically, it can be directed at services based on the aggregator framework
   to display information about resources registered to the 
   aggregator framework.
