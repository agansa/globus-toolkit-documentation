<para>The Aggregator Framework is the software framework on which WS MDS
services (currently, the WS MDS Index and WS MDS Trigger services)
are built. The aggregator framework collects data from an
<emphasis>aggregator source</emphasis> and sends that data to an <emphasis>aggregator
sink</emphasis> for processing. Aggregator sources distributed with the
Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data, acquire
data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to
generate data. Aggregator sinks include modules that implement the
WS MDS Index service interface and the WS MDS Trigger service
interface.</para>
