    <title>Ping test example</title>
    <section id="aggregator-pingtest-introduction">
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>This file describes an example of using the Execution Aggregator Source API.</para>
        <para>The example provides basic ping information about a registrant. It is intended for
            illustrative purposes, rather than real deployment use.</para>
        <para>The aggregator framework is used by other services to collect information. In this
            example, it will be shown how to configure the index service to use the execution
            aggregator source.</para>

        <title>Deploying the example</title>
        <section>
            <title>Install the example script in the correct location.</title>
            <para>The example script is installed as:
                    <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_aggregator/example-ping-exec</filename>.
                It is necessary to copy this to the directory where the execution source will look
                for executables, and ensure that it's executable:</para>
<screen> 
$ cp $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_aggregator/example-ping-exec \
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/aggrexec/. $ chmod a+x
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/aggrexec/example-ping-exec
</screen>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Configure the index to use the execution source.</title>
            <para>By default, the index is configured to use a WS-Resource Properties polling
                mechanism. It is necessary for this example to change the index configuration to use
                the execution source instead.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Register some resources.</title>
            <para>This can be achieved using the <olink targetptr="mds-servicegroup-add"
                    >mds-servicegroup-add tool</olink>.</para>
            <para>Rather than configuring the client to register with parameters for the Resource
                Property polling source, parameters for the execution source should be supplied in
                each registration. </para>
            <para>Register both resources that you know exist, and also some non-existent
            resources.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Observe the results.</title>
            <para>Start the container hosting the index, start the mds-servicegroup-add tool, then
                query the contents of the index with:</para>
            <screen>$ wsrf-query -s http://localhost:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService '/*'</screen>
            <para>Each registration should be represented as an Entry resource property value in the
                output of wsrf-query; embedded in each entry should be an
                <computeroutput>$examplePingResult</computeroutput> element with the results of ping testing.</para>
