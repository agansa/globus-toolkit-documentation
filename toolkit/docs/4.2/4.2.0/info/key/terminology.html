<h2>information</h2>
<p>The information itself as structured data. For monitored entities that are
  WS-Resources, this corresponds to resource properties.</p>
<h2>monitored entities</h2>
<p>That which is being monitored (for WSRF services, equivalent to WS-Resources).
  Essentially any entity in a virtual organization (VO) from which an aggregator
  service can obtain information: for example, a file, a program, a Web service,
  or another network-enabled service.</p>
<h2>information sources</h2>
<p>External sources of information about a monitored entity. [what else can we
  say about them?] </p>
<p> NOTE: something can be both a monitored entity *and* an information source
  if it collects information about itself (e.g., when a WSRF service provides
  information about its own resource properties)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>aggregator source</h2>
<p>An aggregator source collects monitoring information about a monitored entity
  from an information source and passes it to an aggregator service (usually
  an MDS-Index service). More specifically, an aggregator source is a java class
  that implements the AggregatorSource interface to take information about a
  monitored entity from an information source and pass it to an aggregator service
  in XML. The aggregator runs joined to the MDS-Index service and/or as part
  of the MDS-Index service. There are several kinds of aggregator sources. </p>
<h3>Types of aggregator sources </h3>
<h4>WSRF aggregator source </h4>
<p>One kind of aggregator source is used when the monitored entities are WS-Resources.
  This source provides some of the WS-Resource Properties of the monitored WS-Resource
  as monitoring information. What appears in the index in this case are some
  of the WS-Resource Properties of the monitored entities.</p>
<h4>Non-WSRF aggregator source </h4>
<p>Another kind of aggregator source allows collection of information about a
  monitored entity from the information source via [Unix executables]. The output
  of the [Unix executables] is XML monitoring information. What is in that XML
  is dependent on what the executable does. One (under development at the moment)
  is for when the monitored entity is a GridFTP server and provides status information
  about that server as monitoring information. </p>
<h3> Built-in aggregator sources </h3>
<p>Several aggregator sources are included as part of the GT distribution, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;poll-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which polls WSRF services
    for resource properties</li>
  <li>&lt;subscribe-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which receives
    resource properties from WSRF services through subscription/notification</li>
  <li>&lt;executable-source-name&gt;, a non-WSRF aggregator source which runs
    an executable to acquire (or generate) information in some XML form.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relationship between aggregator source, information source and monitored
  entity </h3>
<p>In theory, an aggregator source could simply generate information on its own;
  in practice, however, aggregator sources generally communicate with information
  sources. In turn, information sources can publish information about themselves
  (which also makes it a monitoring entity) but many times publishes information
  about a separate monitored entity. </p>
<p>The following table uses three different examples to describe the relationships:</p>
