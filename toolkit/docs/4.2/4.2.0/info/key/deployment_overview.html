<h1>Deploying MDS4 in a Virtual Organization</h1>

<p>MDS should be deployed in a distributed fashion. Some components
should be deployed central to a VO, whilst others should be deployed
on individual resources. This document is a suggested deployment, and
is not the only way in which MDS4 components can be deployed.

<h3>Central to the VO</h3>

<p>The following steps are VO-wide, although the services deployed do not
need to be run on the same host or be at the same location.</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy an <b>index service</b> central to the VO to collect 
    information about all of the resources in the VO.
    <br />See: <a href="../index/admin/">Index service administrators guide</a>.</li>

<li>Configure an executing <b>index service</b> to execute scripts for 
    monitoring non-WSRF services, and register it to the 
    central index service. This can be central to the VO. 
    <br /> See:
    <a href="../index/admin/#sourcechange">Changing aggregator source, 
    in index admin guide</a></li>

<li>If your VO is part of a larger VO, register the central index 
    service of your VO to the central index of the larger VO.
    <br /> See: <a href="../aggregator/admin/#configuring">Configuration, in 
    the aggregator administrators guide</a> </li>

<li>Install the WebMDS Tech Preview release to show the contents of the
    central index service in a web browser.<br />
    See: <a href="../../techpreview/webmds/index.html">WebMDS
    tech preview</a></li>

<li>Deploy a Trigger Service to notify interested parties about changes
    in the status of the VO.
    <br /> See: <a href="../trigger/admin/">Trigger service administration
    guide</a>
</ul>


<p>On each GRAM resource:</p>

<ul>

<li>Configure <b>cluster monitoring</b> at each GRAM installation to publish 
    information about each resource. 
    <br />See: 
    <a href="gluerp.html">Cluster Monitoring and the GLUE 
    Resource Property</a>.</li>

<li>Register each resource into the central index service. 
    <br /> See: <a href="../aggregator/admin/#configuring">Configuration, in 
    the aggregator administrators guide</a> </li>

</ul>

<p>For each RFT resource, register the RFT Factory to the VO index. 
   <br />See: <a href="../index/admin/registering-rft.html">Registering
   RFT Services to an index</a>.</p>
