<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>
  <para>There are two programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service: information is collected
    using an <glossterm baseform="aggregator source">Aggregator Source</glossterm> and acted upon by an executable program.
  </para>
    <para>There is no specialized client interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
        typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly by creating triggers 
        using mds-servicegroup-add.  The trigger parameters are contained 
        within the TriggerRuleType XML type which is specified as one or more 
        elements in the AggregatorConfig section of the registration message.  
    </para>  
  <para> Information about how to configure existing
        aggregator sources (such as the aggregator sources distributed with
        the Globus Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource
        property information, one that collects resource property
        information through subscription/notification, and one that
        collects information by executing an executable program) is found
        in <xref linkend="aggregator-sources"/>; information about how to
        create new aggregator sources can be found in <xref linkend="aggregator-developer"/>.
    </para>
    <para>    
        The administrator of a Globus installation configures the set of available 
        executable programs that are available to be used as action scripts (for example, an executable
        program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
        will later be read by some other program).
