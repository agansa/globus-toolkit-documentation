    <para>The MDS4 Trigger Service collects information about Grid resources
and can be configured to execute a program if the collected data meets
        certain conditions.</para>
    
    <para>End-users will typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
        specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
        program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
        will later be read by some other program).</para>

  <para><emphasis>Problem: I created a trigger using the <computeroutput>mds-trigger-create</computeroutput>, but I don't see any triggers when I type <computeroutput>mds-trigger-view</computeroutput>!  Where are the triggers?  Why is nothing happening?.</emphasis></para>
  <para>Solution: Did you set up a trigger registration?  (See the administrator's Guide)  The trigger has been created (unless there was an error), but you will not see it and you cannot access it if the trigger registration has not been set up.</para>
<para>General troubleshooting information can be found in <olink targetdoc="javawscoreUser" targetptr="javawscore-user-troubleshooting"/>.</para>
