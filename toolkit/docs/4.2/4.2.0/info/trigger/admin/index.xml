<bookinfo id="trigger-admin-introduction"><abstract><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
   This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with the WS MDS Trigger Service. It provides references to information
     on procedures typically performed by system administrators, including installation,
     configuring, deploying, and testing the installation.</para>

<para> 
This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, overview,
  installation, security configuration instructions in <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/> and <olink targetdoc="mdsAdmin"/>. 
Read through these guides before continuing!</para></abstract>

<para>This component is deployed as part of the standard toolkit installation. By
  default, there are no trigger actions set to fire on container startup, as
  these must be configured and registered manually.</para> 
  <section><title>Manually registering the Trigger Service</title>
  <para>To manually register the
  example described in <olink targetptr="aggregator-configuring"/> (above) do the following:</para>
<orderedlist>
  <listitem><simpara>Configure your environment with either <glossterm>Ganglia</glossterm> or <glossterm>Hawkeye</glossterm> as described
    in the <ulink url="../../key/gluerp.html">GLUE RP documentation</ulink>. This is
    necessary because the trigger service relies on polling the GLUE RP which
  is provided by either one of them.  Note:  Even without configuring Ganglia or Hawkeye, the GLUE RP is emitted by
  the scheduler configured for your environment, so this step is not strictly
  necessary. 
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><para> Now you can start your container as you normally do by running:
    <screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-start-container [-p port] [-nosec]</screen>
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>  At this point, we're ready to make a registration with the <computeroutput>TriggerRegistrationService</computeroutput> by
  running a command similar to the following:
  <screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/mds-servicegroup-add \        
     $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_trigger/trigger-registration-example.xml</screen>
  </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>You should see output similar to the following if your environment has been
configured properly:</para>
<screen>Processing configuration file...
INFO: Processed 1 registration entries
INFO: Successfully registered https://127.0.0.1:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService \
to servicegroup at https://127.0.0.1:8443/wsrf/services/TriggerRegistrationService
</screen>
</section>
<!--<section id="trigger-admin-deploying-tomcat"><title>Deploying into Tomcat</title>
  <para> The WS MDS Trigger Service has been tested to work without any additional setup when deployed into Tomcat. Please follow these <olink targetdoc="javawscoreAdmin" targetptr="javawscore-deploying-tomcat">basic instructions</olink> to deploy GT4 services into Tomcat. Note: please complete any prerequisite service configuration steps before you deploy into Tomcat.</para>

  <indexterm type="trigger-howto"><primary>testing</primary></indexterm>
  <indexterm type="trigger"><primary>testing</primary></indexterm>
<para>To determine if the registration was made properly, you can query the <computeroutput>TriggerRegistrationService</computeroutput>  using a tool like <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/wsrf-query</computeroutput> and visually inspect the
output. </para>
<para>For example, running:</para>
<screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/wsrf-query -s \
     https://127.0.0.1:8443/wsrf/services/TriggerRegistrationService &quot;/*&quot;</screen>
<para> should yield output similar to the following for the example above:</para>
<screen>...
  &lt;ns1:Content xsi:type=&quot;ns11:AggregatorContent&quot; xmlns:ns11=&quot;http://mds.globus.org/aggregator/types&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
   &lt;ns11:AggregatorConfig&gt; 
    &lt;agg:GetResourcePropertyPollType xmlns:agg=&quot;http://mds.globus.org/aggregator/types&quot; xmlns:wssg=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrf/2004/06/wsrf-WS-ServiceGroup-1.2-draft-01.xsd&quot;&gt;
     &lt;agg:PollIntervalMillis&gt;30000&lt;/agg:PollIntervalMillis&gt;
     &lt;agg:ResourcePropertyName&gt;wssg:Entry&lt;/agg:ResourcePropertyName&gt;
    &lt;/agg:GetResourcePropertyPollType&gt;
   &lt;/ns11:AggregatorConfig&gt;
   &lt;ns11:AggregatorData/&gt;
  &lt;/ns1:Content&gt;
...</screen>
<!--<para>The included sample trigger script not only emits some XML data as seen above
  in the <computeroutput>actionOutput</computeroutput> node, but it also attempts to append
  some data to a file each time it is fired. Thus, to be sure it is working properly,
  you can inspect the file <computeroutput>/tmp/glue_detected</computeroutput> by running a
command like</para>
<screen>cat /tmp/glue_detected</screen>
<para>which should yield output
  similar to this:</para>
<screen>GLUECE RP was detected in the output at Mon Apr 11 11:01:01 CDT 2005 
GLUECE RP was detected in the output at Mon Apr 11 11:11:00 CDT 2005 
GLUECE RP was detected in the output at Mon Apr 11 11:21:00 CDT 2005 
GLUECE RP was detected in the output at Mon Apr 11 11:31:00 CDT 2005 
GLUECE RP was detected in the output at Mon Apr 11 11:41:00 CDT 2005</screen>-->

<chapter id="trigger-admin-security_considerations"><title>Security Considerations </title>
<para>The security considerations for the
<olink targetdoc="aggregator">Aggregator Framework</olink> also apply to the
    Trigger Service:</para>

    <chapter id="trigger-admin-debugging">
    <title>Debugging</title>
       <para>Because WS MDS is built on Java WS Core, it uses the same sys admin logging, described below:</para>

<!--  <para><emphasis>Problem: I'm sure the registration was made properly, but the trigger script never fires.</emphasis></para>
  <para>Solution: Verify that you've properly configured the <ulink url="&docpath;info/key/gluerp.html">GLUE RP output</ulink>
  via Ganglia or Hawkeye. Even a properly made trigger registration will never
fire if the GLUE RP cannot be produced.</para>-->
