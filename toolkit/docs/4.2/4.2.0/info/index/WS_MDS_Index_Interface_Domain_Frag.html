<h3>Interface introduction</h3>
<p>There is no domain-specific interface specific to the Index Service, however,
the ExecutionAggregatorSource, which may be used by the Index Service, does
have a domain-specific interface (specifically, the inputs provided to and
outputs expected from the executable program).
</p>
<h3>Syntax of the interface</h3>
<p>The syntax of the execution source's domain-specific interface is described
in the <a href="/4.0-drafts/info/aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#domain">Aggregator Framework Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
