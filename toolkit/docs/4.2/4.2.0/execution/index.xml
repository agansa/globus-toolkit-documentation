      <para>Execution management tools are concerned with the initiation, monitoring, management,
            scheduling, and/or coordination of remote computations (or jobs). GT4 supports the Grid
            Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM) interface as a basic mechanism for these
            purposes.</para>
      <para>The GRAM server is typically deployed in conjunction with the <olink
                  targetdoc="delegation">Delegation</olink> and <olink targetdoc="rft">RFT</olink>
            services to address data staging, delegation of proxy credentials, and computation
            monitoring and management in an integrated manner. </para>
      <para>C, Java, and Python client APIs, as well as command line tools, are provided for [both
            systems - confused *which* systems?]. </para>
      <para>More information is provided in <olink targetdoc="executionKey"/>.</para>
      <para>GT4 includes two different GRAM implementations: <itemizedlist>
