The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing of
computing resources (clusters , computing farms, servers, supercomputers...),
managed by different LRM (Local Resource Management) systems, such as PBS, SGE,
LSF, Condor..., within a single organization (enterprise grid) or scattered
across several administrative domains (partner or supply-chain grid).
