    <title>Default local resource manager</title>
    <para>
      In GRAM4 an administrator can configure a default local resource manager
      being used for job submission if the client did not specify any in a job
      submission request. Check section <olink targetdoc="gram4Admin"
      targetptr="gram4-Interface_Config_default-lrm">Defining a default local
      resource manager</olink> in the <olink targetdoc="gram4Admin">System

  <section id="gram4-admin-migrating-gt4-audit">
    <title>Audit Logging</title>
    <para>
      The log4j configuration for audit logging in GRAM4 in 4.2 is slightly
      different compared to the 4.0 series. This involves log4j and database
      configuration changes. For the log4j configuration check section
      section <olink targetdoc="gram4Admin"
      targetptr="gram4-audit-logging-config-log4j">Configure Log4j</olink> in the
      <olink targetdoc="gram4Admin">System Administrator's Guide</olink> for more

  <section id="gram4-admin-migrating-gt4-lifetime">
    <title>Job lifetime</title>
    <para>
      An administrator can configure lifetime parameters for all jobs in GRAM4's
      JNDI configuration. In short these parameters restrict the maximum lifetime
      a client can set on a job, and the maximum time a job is kept in the container
      and thus in the persistence directory after the job had been fully processed.
      Check section <olink targetdoc="executionKey"
      targetptr="execution-approach-lifetime">Job Lifetime</olink> in the
      <olink targetdoc="executionKey">Execution key concepts</olink> and section

    <title>Local Java calls from GRAM4 to RFT</title>
    <para>
      By default GRAM4 in the 4.0 series does Web Service invocations when
      calling RFT to perform staging and file cleanup. The default in GRAM4 in 
      4.2 is local java calls to significantly improve performance in jobs with
      staging and file cleanup. If GRAM4 is configured to use RFT in a separate
      machine local invocations are disabled. For more information check the section

      An administrator can configure the number of threads in the thread-pool that
      is responsible for handling scheduler events. The default size should be fine
      for all Scheduler Event Generators (SEGs) provided by Globus. It might be

      GRAM4 in 4.2 defines a default local resource manager which is used for
      job execution if the user did not explicitly specify one. A user however
      still can specify a local resource manager (LRM), e.g. if it's required

      GRAM4 does not extend from the ImmediateResourceTermination port type anymore, 
      i.e. the Destroy() operation is no longer available to synchronously destroy
      job resources. Instead GRAM4 offers an asynchronous Terminate() method that
      lets clients terminate jobs and destroy a job resource.

      In GRAM4 in the 4.0 series a client had to destroy subscription resources
      before destroying a job if it subscribed for notifications in order to cleanup
      state on the server-side.
      In GRAM4 in 4.2 all subscription resources of a job resource are destroyed
      on the server-side automatically if a job resource is destroyed. There's no
      need to keep track of subscription resources anymore.

    <para>
      In GRAM4 an administrator can configure a default local resource manager (LRM)
      being used for job submission if the client did not specify any in a job
      submission request.
      To submit a job to the default local resource manager just don't put
      a ReferenceParameters element in the EndpointReference used to contact
      GRAM4's job factory service.
      By querying resource properties of GRAM4's factory service a client can find
      out which local resource manager is the default, or which LRM's are 
      available on the server-side.

      CreateManagedJobInputType.JobID had been used as server-side job id for

      the job and the client-side generated ID will only be stored to enable
      reliable job submission. A client cannot use the self-generated id for any
      job operation besides a second submission call for multi-jobs anymore.
