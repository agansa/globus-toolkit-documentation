<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p> WS-GRAM allows for remote execution and management of programs through the 
creation of a managed job. The management of the job is taken care of primarily
by core toolkit functionality (WS-ResourceLifetime and WS-BaseN
implementations).  Please see the core documentation on notifications and
resource lifetime (destruction) for more information.</p>

<p><font color="red">[Add link to appropriate core documentation.]</font></p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>There are just two operations defined in the GRAM port types (not counting
the Rendezvous port type which is used for MPI job synchronization):
"createManagedJob" in the Managed Job Factory port type, and "release" in the
Managed Job port type. All other operations (such as canceling/killing the job
and querying for resource properties) are provided by the underlying WSRF
implementation of the toolkit.</p>

<b>Managed Job Factory Port Type</b> <br>
<br>
<i>createManagedJob</i><br>

<p>To create a job, a call to the appropriate Managed Job Factory service is
made using the <i>createManagedJob</i> operation with the desired input
parameters.  Two important input parameters are the "subscribe" parameter and
the holdState field in the job description. The first allows for
subscribe-on-create functionality so that a separate call isn't needed to
register for state change notifications. It is also the only way to guarantee
that all notification messages will reach the client.  The second
parameter--again, this is actually a field within the job description
parameter--indicates on which state there should be placed a "hold". This is
important since it gives justification to the existance of the second job
management operation: <i>release</i>.</p>

<b>Managed Job Port Type</b> <br>
<br>
<i>release</i><br>

<p>The release operation removes a hold placed on a state through the
population of the holdState field in the job description.  For example, a
hold placed on the Pending state will prevent the submission of the jobs to the
local resource manager until a release call is made.  Not all job states are
allowed to have a hold placed on them.  Only the states StageIn, Pending,
StageOut, and CleanUp will allow holds placed on them.  Attempts to place
holds on the other states will result in an error if that state is
encountered.</p>
