<h3>managed-job-globusrun: Java-based Job Submission Tool for GRAM</h3>

<h4>Tool Description</h4>
<p>
<tt>managed-job-globusrun</tt> is the job submission tool 
for the Globus Toolkit 3.9.3, i.e. it is a program for submitting jobs to a 
local or remote job host and managing those jobs via GRAM services. 
GRAM services provide secure job submission to many types of job schedulers 
for users who have the right to access a job hosting resource in a Grid environment. 
All GRAM job submission options are supported transparently through the
embedded request document input. In fact, the job startup is done by submitting 
a client-side provided job description (RSL)
to the GRAM services.
<p>
In addition to starting jobs, it is possible to delegate credentials needed for
certain optional GRAM features, query the state of a previously 
started job and parse a job description file without making any submission.
Online and batch submission modes are supported with reattachment (recovery) 
for jobs whether they were started with this client or another GRAM client 
application.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> the existence of a valid proxy is required for essentially all
supported operations but job description file parsing (<code>-p</code>). In order 
to generate a valid proxy file, use the grid-proxy-init tool available 
under $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT RELEASE NOTE:</b> this version of the job submission tool is <i>not</i> 
the final version that will be suplied with GT 4.0. A job submission tool 
(written in C) will be provided with additional features such as file streaming.

      whether the remote service is the one intended. Depending on the configured authorization

<h4>New Functionality</h4>
<p>

<h5>Substitution Variables</h5>
TODO reference: link to HTML generated from schema annotations
<p>

<h5>Submission ID</h5>
<p>
A submission ID may be used in the GRAM protocol for robust
reliability in the face of message faults or other transient errors in order 
to ensure that at most one instance of a job is executed, i.e. to prevent
accidental duplication of jobs under rare circumstances with client
retry on failure. The managed-job-globusrun tool always uses this feature,
requiring either a submission ID to be passed in as input or a new
unique ID to be created by the tool itself. If a new ID is created, it
should be captured by the user who wishes to exploit this reliability
interface. The ID in use, whether created or passed as input, will be
written to the first line of standard output unless the <i>quiet mode</i> 
is in effect.
</p>

<p>
If a user is unsure whether a job was submitted successfully, he
should resubmit using the same ID as was used for the previous
attempt.
</p>

<h5>Job Hold and Release</h5>
<p>

<h5>MultiJobs</h5>
<p>

<p><h5>Job and Process Rendezvous</h5>
<p>


<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>

With the porting of existing GRAM functionality from OGSI to WSRF, 
this new version of the job submission tool suffers from a few limitations 
comparatively to previous versions of the tool.
These limitations will be dealt with in the next version of the tool, which 
will be implemented in C and thus will also be more performant.

<p><h5>No more file staging using GASS</h5><p>
The GASS server is not being used anymore by GRAM, so the options 
-server and -write are not available anymore. This is not a limitation 
per se, since instead, file staging is done in a reliable fashion 
by using GridFTP servers installed on the client machine and 
the remote machine hosting the GRAM services. The file staging directives 
in the job description must now contain paths that can be resolved 
to GridFTP URLs.
TODO add link to HowTo StageFiles here.
<p>

<p><h5>No standard output redirection yet</h5><p>
Unlike the GT3.2 managed-job-globusrun used with the option -output, 
this version of the tool does not offer any streamed redirection of 
the standard streams. This is because the GASS server is not used anymore 
by GRAM. Instead, a future version of the tool will allow for streaming 
of any server-side file (including the standard streams of the job 
execution) using GridFTP "tailing" of remote files.<p>

<p><h5>No listing of submitted jobs yet</h5><p>
The -list option, which made the 3.2 tool print the identifiers of the jobs 
submitted by the user on the standard output, is not available in this version 
of the tool.
<p>
</p>


<h4>Tool Behavior for some Features</h4>
<p><p>


<h5>Tool-triggered Automatic Job Resource Destruction</h5>
 <p>
 Execution errors and user interrupt events are handled by automatically
 destroying the requested job service(s), unless the -batch option
 is on the command-line. The -batch option prevents the tool from
 listening to job state changes and from waiting for the job to finish.
 If -batch is selected, the command will return as soon as the remote
 job has been submitted.
 <p>
 The behavior of the tool with respect to job service destruction will vary
 in response to several kinds of events:
 <ul>
 <li> The command exits normally after the job(s) finish(es), and destroys
      the job service(s) it requested. In batch mode, the requested job
      is never destroyed.
  <li> The command is terminated in response to a user interrupt, such as
      typing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em>, or a system-wide event, such as user logoff or system
      shutdown. If the -no-interrupt option is on the command-line,
      and the command-line has been successfully parsed when the interrupt
      occurs, the tool does not destroy any job service(s) it requested.
      Otherwise the tool destroys the requested job service(s).
  <li> In case of any error of execution, the command will exit and
      destroy the job(s) it successfully requested.
 </ul>
 <p>
 <p>
 If the Java virtual machine of the tool aborts, that is, stops running without shutting down
 cleanly, for instance because it received a SIGKILL signal on Unix, then no
 guarantee can be made about whether or not the job service(s) will be
 destroyed.
 <p>
 Note: the shutdown behavior explained above cannot be guaranteed if the
 JVM option -Xrs is entered.
 The recommended way to disable service destruction is to specify
 the -batch option on the command-line.

<h5>Credential Delegation</h5>

<h6>Single job submission</h6>
managed-job-globusrun checks the job description to see if 
delegated credentials are required for the job.  If so, it  
delegates a proxy to the Globus delegation services and add the 
EPR to the job description accordingly.  
The possible elements where the EPR could be added are: 
jobCredentialEndpoint, stagingCredentialEndpoint, 
fileStageIn, fileStageOut, fileCleanUp.  
The MJS will fetch the cred from the DS and use as needed on 
behalf of the job.  
See the RSL documentation for descriptions about these attributes.
TODO insert link to RSL doco.

For every job that managed-job-globusrun delegates a credential for, 
the tool augments the job description with annotations 
that will later tell managed-job-globusrun to destroy the 
credential after the job has been destroyed.  
Below are 2 job annotation examples.

managed-job-globusrun only delegated the job credentials:
<pre>
   &lt;extensions&gt;

      &lt;globusrunAnnotation&gt;
         &lt;automaticJobDelegation&gt;true&lt;/automaticJobDelegation&gt;
      &lt;/globusrunAnnotation&gt;
   &lt;/extensions&gt;
</pre>

managed-job-globusrun delegated the job, staging and transfer credentials:
<pre>
   &lt;extensions&gt;
      &lt;globusrunAnnotation&gt;
        &lt;automaticJobDelegation&gt;true&lt;/automaticJobDelegation&gt;
        &lt;automaticStagingDelegation&gt;true&lt;/automaticStagingDelegation&gt;

        &lt;automaticTransferDelegation&gt;true&lt;/automaticTransferDelegation&gt;
      &lt;/globusrunAnnotation&gt;
   &lt;/extensions&gt;
</pre>

<h6>MultiJob submission</h6>
managed-job-globusrun delegates full credentials to the delegation service 
for the multijob, then processes each single job as stated in the single 
job submission case. 
If several subjobs are to use the same delegation service, then only 
one credential will be delegated to that delegation service, i.e. the same 
credential will be used for several jobs.


</p>

<h4>How To Do Common Job Submission Tasks</h4>
<p>

<h5>Submitting a Job in Interactive Mode</h5>

A very simple command-line can be used to submit a job. 
For instance, the following command-line submits a job 
described in the file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/gram-client/test.xml 
to the GRAM services hosted on the same machine (assuming a 
Globus container is running of course):<p>

% bin/managed-job-globusrun -f share/gram-client/test.xml<p>

The output should look like:<p>
<pre>
Submission ID: uuid:661AA7F0-2573-11D9-99B2-D4755757F903
WAITING FOR JOB TO FINISH
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: Active
========================================
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: CleanUp
========================================
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: Done
========================================
Exit Code: 0
DESTROYING SERVICE
SERVICE DESTROYED
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> the job state notifications are printed in the order of arrival, but 
              they may arrive at the client-side in <i>any order</i>.
<p>
<p>
In this example the job description specifies the standard output 
stream path of the job to be: ${GLOBUS_USER_HOME}/stdout. The GRAM 
services replace the substitution variable ${GLOBUS_USER_HOME} 
with the path to the Home directory of the submitting user 
as seen by the machine were the invoked GRAM services are hosted.
You can thus verify the output of the job with the following 
command:<p>

% cat ~/stdout
<p>
which will display the string:<p>
12 abc 34 pdscaex_instr_GrADS_grads23_28919.cfg pgwynnel was here

<h5>Submitting a Job in Batch Mode, Checking its Status and Destroying the Resource</h5>

To submit a job without having the client wait for job completion, 
specify the option -batch (or -b) on the command-line:
<pre>
% bin/managed-job-globusrun -batch -f share/gram-client/test.xml
Warning: Will not wait for job completion, and will not destroy job service.
Submission ID: uuid:9C715240-26C7-11D9-850A-ABE2020F9ED6
CREATED MANAGED JOB SERVICE WITH HANDLE:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/wsrf/services/ManagedExecutableJobService?9C715240-26C7-11D9-850A-ABE2020F9ED6
</pre>

To check the status of the job, use the -state option:
<pre>
% bin/managed-job-globusrun -state 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/wsrf/services/ManagedExecutableJobService?9C715240-26C7-11D9-850A-ABE2020F9ED6'
Job State: Done
</pre>

To destroy the job resource created on the server side, use the -kill option:
<pre>
% bin/managed-job-globusrun -kill 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/wsrf/services/ManagedExecutableJobService?9C715240-26C7-11D9-850A-ABE2020F9ED6'

<h5>Finding which Schedulers are Interfaced by the GRAM Installation</h5>

Unfortunately there is no option yet to print the list of local resource 
managers supported by a given GRAM service installation. 
Such information must currently be obtained and provided out of band to the user. 
On the server side, in <tt>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/</tt>, there is one directory 
<tt>gram-service-&lt;manager&gt;/</tt> for each local resource manager supported 
by the GRAM installation. 
For instance:
<pre>
% ls etc | grep gram-service-
gram-service-Fork
gram-service-LSF
gram-service-Multi
</pre>
In this example, the Multi, Fork and LSF job factory resources have been 
installed. <tt>Multi</tt> is a special kind of local resource manager 
which enables the GRAM services to support multijobs (TODO link to section).

The JNDI configuration file located under each manager directory 
contains information about the name of the resource manager. For 
instance, <tt>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gram-service-Fork/jndi-config.xml</tt> 
contains the following XML element structure:
<pre>
    &lt;service name="ManagedJobFactoryService"&gt;
        &lt;!-- LRM configuration:  Fork --&gt;
        &lt;resource
            name="ForkResourceConfiguration"
            type="org.globus.exec.service.factory.FactoryResourceConfiguration"&gt;
            &lt;resourceParams&gt;
                [...]
                &lt;parameter&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;
                        <b>localResourceManagerName</b>
                    &lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        <b>Fork</b>
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                &lt;/parameter&gt;           
                [...]
            &lt;/resourceParams&gt;
        &lt;/resource&gt;        
    &lt;/service&gt;
</pre>
In the example above, the GRAM name of the local resource manager is <tt>Fork</tt>. 
This value can be used with the <tt>-type</tt> option to specify which 
factory resource to use when submitting a job.

<h5>Job Execution Errors</h5>
TODO insert link to GRAM error codes.

<h5>Common Issues</h5>

<h6>Expired Credentials</h6>
<b>Symptom:</b> the client output shows an error related to expired credentials, 
as in:
<pre>
Error: error submitting job request: ; nested exception is:
        javax.xml.rpc.soap.SOAPFaultException: Expired credentials 
        (O=Grid,OU=GlobusTest,OU=simpleCA.mymachine,OU=mymachine,CN=John Doe,CN=1255793213).
</pre>
<b>Solution:</b> use the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/grid-proxy-init tool to create a new proxy file:
<pre>
% bin/grid-proxy-init
Your identity: /O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA.mymachine/OU=mymachine/CN=John Doe
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until: Tue Oct 26 01:33:42 2004
</pre>
<p>
<h6>Socket Timeout Error</h6>
<b>Symptom:</b> the client output shows a timeout error when waiting for 
                the response from the GRAM service(s):<p>
<pre>
Error: error submitting job request: ; nested exception is:
        java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
</pre>                
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> re-submit the job with a higher delay before HTTP socket timeout than the default. 
Use the <tt>-timeout</t> option of <tt>managed-job-globusrun</tt>, as in:
<pre>
% bin/managed-job-globusrun -timeout 240000 -f myJob.xml
</pre>

<h6>File(s) Not Found Warnings</h6>
<b>Symptom:</b> the server LOG displays messages at WARN severity such as:
<pre>
[Thread-3] WARN  factory.ManagedJobFactoryResource [getRestartTimestamp:187] java.io.FileNotFoundException: /software/globus/gt4/rc3.9.3/var/globus-jsm-fork.stamp (No such file or directory)
[Thread-3] WARN  factory.ManagedJobFactoryResource [getRestartTimestamp:187] java.io.FileNotFoundException: /software/globus/gt4/rc3.9.3/var/globus-jsm-multi.stamp (No such file or directory)
[Thread-2] WARN  utils.XmlPersistenceHelper [load:185] [CORE] File /nfs/v5/alain/.globus/persisted/128.9.72.67/ManagedExecutableJobResourceStateType/897BC6E0-26CA-11D9-8D59-FF280F77E689.xml for resource {http://www.globus.org/namespaces/2004/10/gram/job}ResourceID=897BC6E0-26CA-11D9-8D59-FF280F77E689 was not found
</pre>
<b>Solution:</b> the log messages above are harmless and are not indicative of any problem in the 
behavior of the GRAM service. they can be ignored.

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<h6>Client Hanging Forever</h6>
<b>Symptom:</b> in interactive (i.e. non-batch) mode, the managed-job-globusrun client 
            seems to be stuck waiting for additional job state notifications.
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> This is a known problem which can happen sometimes.<p>

Possible solution: remove the timestamp files in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var:
<pre>
% rm var/globus-jsm-*.stamp
</pre>
Restart the container.
<p>
If you decide to report the issue, please provide the job description 
and submission command-line as well as a full server-side GRAM log 
so we can determine the cause of the problem:<p>
edit $GLOBUS_LOCATION/log4j.properties to add exec=DEBUG
restart container and execute the same job submission command-line
submit full GRAM server LOG to support list

<h6>NotRegisteredException ERROR Log Message</h6>
<b>Symptom:</b> the following message appears in the server log
<pre>
[Thread-7] ERROR jobmanager.JobManager [unsubscribeForNotifications:1762] unable to stop monitoring job for state changes
org.globus.exec.monitoring.NotRegisteredException
	at org.globus.exec.monitoring.JobStateMonitor.unregisterJobID(JobStateMonitor.java:375)
	at org.globus.exec.service.job.jobmanager.JobManager.unsubscribeForNotifications(JobManager.java:1758)
	at org.globus.exec.service.job.jobmanager.JobManager.processState(JobManager.java:1274)
	at org.globus.exec.service.job.jobmanager.RunQueue.run(RunQueue.java:75)
</pre>

<b>Solution:</b> this is typically harmless and can be ignored.

</p>
