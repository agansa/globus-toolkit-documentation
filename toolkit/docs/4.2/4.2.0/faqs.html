<h1>GT4 Development FAQs</h1>
<p>This page is a collection of questions currently being asked about GT4 and
its development releases (starting with 3.9.3). This page is not in any particular
  order and will be updated on a best-effort basis; however, it is the foundation
  for more formalized FAQ pages for 4.0 Final. </p>

<h2 id="concretetopicpath">Will GT4 support ConcreteTopicPath Expressions?</h2>
<p>  GT 4.0 will not support ConcreteTopicPath expressions (the required
  structure for modeling more advanced topic spaces is there but the topic
  path evaluation code is not there).</p>
<h2 id="samples">  How can I get samples?</h2>
<p>  Look for the counter wsdl in <code>schema/core/samples/counter</code>.</p>
<p>  (TODO: check up on this - someone said they looked there but couldn't find
    it)</p>
<h2 id="trackcode">  How can I track changes in the codebase?<strong> Are other
    Mozilla-derived services such as LXR and Tinderbox available?</strong></h2>
<p>  Use bonsai at: </p>
<p><a href="http://bonsai.globus.org/cvsqueryform.cgi">http://bonsai.globus.org/cvsqueryform.cgi</a></p>
<p>For example if you want to know every checkin for the last days, select the &quot;In
  the last Day&quot; radio button.</p>
<p><strong>  </strong>Viewcvs has replaced LXR. See:</p>
<p><a href="http://viewcvs.globus.org/"> http://viewcvs.globus.org/</a></p>
<p>We do not currently have a Tinderbox install running.</p>
<h2 id="jdkorjre">Is a JDK really required or just a JRE? I would guess that only a
    JRE is needed to support running Grid Services, but a JDK is needed to develop
services.</h2>
<p>[TODO: find answer] </p>
<h2 id="ibmsunjdk">Are you planning to test with both the IBM and Sun JDK/JRE's?</h2>
<p>[TODO: find answer] </p>
<h2 id="supportjdk1.5">Is there a strong requirement to support JDK/JRE 1.5 for GT 4.0?</h2>
<p>[TODO: find answer] </p>
<h2 id="testos">Do you have a list of the operating system platforms that Globus is
    testing on? </h2>
<p>  Tested platforms are available for each component in multiple docs. One
  path is to go to the Release Notes draft page at <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/release_notes.html">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/release_notes.html</a>,
  click a component's link and click 'Tested Platforms&quot; </p>
<h2 id="packageclient">Is there an easy way to package up a GT4 client?</h2>
<p>  Try:</p>
<pre>make-packages.pl --deps </pre>
<p>on the top level packages you want. 
  The result will be a GPT bundle with all the dependencies. For example:</p>
<pre>./make-packages.pl --deps \
   --packages=globus_wsrf_rft_client_java,globus_globusrun_ws</pre>
<p>See <code>bundle-output/</code> for your custom bundle.</p>
<h2 id="clientjars">Which jars in G_L/lib do I need to include in the client? Is there any easy
way to do this?</h2>
<p>Use <code>--deps</code>.</p>
<h2 id="zipsize">  I'm concerned about the size the zip file will be when I'm done. For a simple
client, the size could easily reach 10 MB. Is this just the way it is?</h2>
<p>  Probably. The components are much more integrated
  with each other than ever before, and sometimes it's surprising the number
of dependencies you can get for building a single package.</p>
<p>  Using make-packages.pl line <a href="#packageclient">above</a>, the resulting source bundle is 24 MB.</p>
<p>  For Java WS Core we can easily create a binary distribution that will work
  on Windows or anything else. Hopefully by 4.0 we can have that as a download
  option. In general, we can make the size of the distribution smaller by taking
  out certain libraries. The distribution would be optimized for certain JVM
  version or specific deployment scenario. For example, some libraries are
  only needed for Java 1.3 (e.g. jgss.jar), some are only needed for compilation
(e.g. servlet.jar), some are Tomcat specific (e.g. cog-tomcat.jar). </p>
<p>  You'll need pretty much the entire Java WS Core for any client side work.</p>
<p>  Some schema files or configuration could be dropped but I'm not sure if will
affect the size of the distribution in any major way.</p>
<h2 id="allcommandline">  How can I get all the command line scripts, including the one for
    <code>grid-proxy-init</code>?</h2>
<p>  Instead of <code>ant</code>, run:</p>
<pre>ant deploy -Dall.scripts=true</pre>
<h2 id="buildcilent">How do I build a client for my service?</h2>
<p>Note: this question is in reference to Scott Gose's page about WSRF Grid Services
  at: </p>
<p><a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/%7Egose/grid-services/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/%7Egose/grid-services/</a></p>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Package the service up into a client jar, stub jar, and service jar.</li>
  <li> Deploy the service behind a stock wsrf install/.</li>
  <li> Tar up that directory for the &quot;server&quot; download.</li>
  <li> If you don't want to distribute the service code, remove lib/service.jar.</li>
  <li> Tar up that directory for the &quot;client&quot; download.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the &quot;excess&quot; in the client download would be relatively small.</p>
<h2 id="postgresqlerror">In GT 3.9.3, I set up a PostgreSQL database for RFT, and now instead
    of the usual <code>failed
  to connect to database</code> error, I get the following. Has anyone seen this
  before? :</h2>
<pre>[main] WARN service.ReliableFileTransferHome [initialize:85] Error creating   
RFT Home : Failed to connect to database Until this is corrected all RFT requests 
fail and all GRAM jobs that require file staging will fail: Exeception in getActive 
[Caused by: ERROR: permission denied for relation request]</pre>
<p>   If you created the database as user 'damon' then change the <code>userName</code>  in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/jndi-config.xml</code> to 'damon'. </p>
<p>  [Response from the user:] That would work, but it's probably easier to run
  createdb as the db admin, and load the schema as the globus user. That
  way the globus user doesn't need to be capable of creating databases. For example, </p>
<pre>postgres$ createdb --owner globusUser rft-db
globus$ psql -d rft -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft/rft_schema.sql</pre>
<h2> Is there a container I can use to get started quickly? </h2>
<p>If you just want to get started, there is a pre-built container here:</p>
<p> <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/%7Egose/grid-services/container/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gose/grid-services/container/</a></p>
<p>You should be able to untar it, cd into it, and set your GLOBUS_LOCATION to
  get started quickly since it's already built.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove old build files by running:
    <pre>ant clean</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    </p>
Get any updated files from cvs by running:
<pre>cvs -d up</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    </p>
Rebuild by running:
<pre>ant -Dall.scripts=true</pre> </li> </ol>
<h2 id="docs"> Where can I find documentation, tutorials, etc?</h2>

      via <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/bugzilla.html">Bugzilla</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mds4docs">Where's the best place to start learning about MDS4? </h2>
<p>A good starting point is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/key/deployment_overview.html">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/key/deployment_overview.html</a> </p>

<p>You can find samples: [TODO: find samples] </p>
<h2 id="mds4services">What's the relationship between
Index, Trigger and Aggregator services?</h2>
<p>The aggregator is not a service -- it is a framework used by the Index and
Trigger services. Here are some quickstart instructions. </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="admin/">Install a full GT toolkit</a>. This
    installation should install an Index Service in your container.</li>
  <li><a href="info/index/admin/index.html">Set up your index service.</a> </li>
  <li>Now  you need some
    things to put in it. GRAM managed job services are a basic example of this
    (on the same host or on other hosts). Once you have decided which services
      to register, you need to use the <code>globus-servicegroup-register</code> command.
    There are brief notes on this in: <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.3/info/aggregator/admin/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.3/info/aggregator/admin/</a>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Make a configuration file listing which services should be registered
          to your index</li>
      <li>Run the <code>globus-servicegroup-register</code> command with that
            config file.<br />
			There is an example registration file in:
			<pre>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_aggregator/example-aggregator-registration.xml</pre>
			which gives an example of what the file looks like.<br />
			The file specifies <code>&lt;Registration&gt;</code> which lists a
    servicegroup EPR (i.e. an Index or Trigger Service), a registrant EPR (i.e.
    the GRAM managed job service), and details of what should be collected from
    the registrant.<br />
	An example that has been used in live production is available <a href="info/gt4-isi-testgrid-reg.xml">here</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Launch the client with:
     <pre>mds-servicegroup-add -s \    
  http://yourhost:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService registrations.xml</pre>
  where <code>registrations.xml</code> is the registration file prepared
    above.
  <br>
</li><li>
  Once you have that, you can query your index with:<br>
  <pre>wsrf-query -s http://yourhost:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService '/*' </pre>
  Results will be returned in XML.
  </li>
</ol>
