<h1>Usage Statistics in the Globus Toolkit</h1>
<p>Beginning with Version 3.9.5, the Globus Toolkit has the capability to send usage statistics back to the Globus Alliance.  </p>

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>  <p>The Globus Project has had funding from many sources, however, it is largely a government funded project.  Our funding agencies are demanding that we provide them proof that there is benefit being gained from their investment.  We have been challenged by funders to answer the following types of questions:</p>

<li>"Prove that ANYONE uses GridFTP (presentations apparently don't count)"</li>
<li>"How many jobs were run using GRAM last month" </li>
<li>"How many GT4 web services containers are running" </li>

<p>The easiest way for our users to help us prove to our funding sources (some of which also fund our large users) that the Toolkit is used widely and often is to allow their installations of the Globus Toolkit to send us generic usage statistics.  </p>

<h2>The overview:</h2>  <p>Components affected are GridFTP, Java Core, C Core, WS-GRAM, and the Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service.  The data sent is as generic as possible (see <a href=#whatissent>What is Sent?</a> below).  Every component affected has a section titled "Usage Statistics" in its users guide and admin guide that lists precisely what is sent, and the configuration control that is available (including the ability to disable sending the data).  To make this a win-win proposition, we have made the receiver for the data available in the contrib directory.  This means that a (virtual) organization could set up their own listener and collect organization wide usage statistics.  </p>

<h2>Opt-Out</h2> We are using opt-out rather than opt-in.  There are two reasons for this.

<p>First, we <it><em>NEED</em></it> this data.  Although we trust that our fellow users are willing to lend a hand in showing that Grid Computing works and is in use, we know that requiring any additional effort to set up usage statistic reporting would drastically reduce the reporting percentage, and we would not get much data.  To be effective, we need to require zero additional effort.</p>

<p>Secondly, we firmly believe that once they see the data that is being collected, and understand why and what will be done with it, the majority of the people will, in the name of supporting the development of open source Grid Computing tools, want to help us by allowing us to receive this generic usage data.  To make things easy for our users to help us we need to require zero additional setup.</p>

<p>By not opting out, and allowing these statistics to be reported back, you
are explicitly supporting the further development of the Globus Toolkit.</p>




<h2><a name="whatissent" id="whatissent">What is sent?</h2> The components affected (for 3.9.5) are GridFTP, Java Core, C Core, WS-GRAM, and the Reliable File Transfer (RFT) Service.  We send the "how much" data, not "the what" data.  For instance, GridFTP sends the number of bytes, how long the transfer took, how many streams were used, etc.  It does NOT send filenames, usernames, or even the destination IP since that would mean that the source site would make a decision about sending information about the destination site.

<p>Each component has a section in its users guide and admin guide listing what is being sent, and the admin guide explains configurations related to the usage statistics.  Links to these sections are provided here:</p>

<h2>How is the data sent?</h2>  The messages are sent as a single UDP packet.  While this may cause us to lose some data, it drastically reduces the possibility that the usagestatistics reporting can adversely affect the operation of the software.

<h2>When is the data sent?</h2>  Once per "task" (GridFTP transfer, GRAM Job, container invocation, etc), either immediately upon startup, or at completion of the task.

<h2>What will the data be used for?</h2> The data will be used for answering the types of questions listed above.  How many jobs were run with GRAM last month?  How many gigabytes of data has GridFTP moved?  We will also try and mine the data for operational issues.  What percentage of the jobs run complete successfully?  Of the ones that fail, what is the most common fault code returned?  What we have no intention of doing is publishing things such as IP 123.456.789.012 sent 10 TB of data last month.  Our intent is to make the data that we get generic enough that for the most part, we do not have to worry what is done with it.  We record the IP only for counting purposes, so that we know how many sites there are, but we have no intention of producing site specific statistics.


<h2>Feedback:</h2>Please send us your feedback at usage_stats@globus.org.  Feedback from our user communities will be useful in determining our path forward with this in the future.  We do ask that if you have concerns or objections, please give be specific in your feedback.  For instance, "Our site has a policy against sending such data" is good information for us to know for the future.  A link to such a policy would be even better.
