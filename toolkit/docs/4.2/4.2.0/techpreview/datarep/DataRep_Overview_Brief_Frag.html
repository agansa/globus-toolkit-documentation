<p>The Data Replication Service (DRS) is a technical preview provided with the Globus Toolkit 4.0 and first appears in the GT 3.9.5 Beta release. The primary functionality of the component allows users to identify a set of desired files existing in their Grid environment and to make local replicas of the data files by transfering files from one or more source locations. The DRS conforms to the WS-RF specification and exposes a WS-Resource (called a "Replicator" resource) which represents the transactional state of the requested replication activity and allows users to query or subscribe to various Resource Properties in order to monitor the state of the resource. The DRS is built on the GT 4.0 Java WS Core and uses the Globus RLS to locate and register replicas and the Globus RFT to transfer files. The service also depends on use of a standard database server via JDBC interfaces. Included in this release is a client tool, which allows users to create a Replicator resource by passing a request file as a command line parameter.</p>
