<section id="s-datarep-admin-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with the Data Replication Service (DRS). It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installing, configuring,
 deploying, and testing the installation.</para>
 <important>
  <simpara> This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
   overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <ulink url="../../admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink>.

<section id="s-datarep-admin-installing"><title>Building and installing</title>
<para>DRS is not installed as part of the standard install. To install the DRS, first install the Globus Toolkit
 by following the basic installation instructions as referenced above. Following the basic installation, issue
 a <emphasis>make gt4-replicator postinstall</emphasis> command from the directory that was used to build the toolkit. The
 following commands will install the DRS.</para>
<screen>
 ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install --with-iodbc=/path/to/iodbcdir --enable-drs
 make
 make install
</screen>
<important><para>The DRS depends on the Globus RLS. In order for the &quot;make&quot; command above to build
 and install the RLS, you must follow the basic installation instructions for GT 4.0 as noted previously. 
 Installation of the RLS requires that the <computeroutput>--with-iodbc</computeroutput> configure flag or the 
 <computeroutput>GLOBUS_IODBC_PATH</computeroutput> environment variable be properly set <emphasis>before</emphasis> 
 issuing the <computeroutput>make</computeroutput> command. Not setting this environment variable before installation
 is a common mistake encountered by users.</para></important>

<para>Generating verbose log output is a critical aid in troubleshooting of the DRS and is useful 
when communicating problems to Globus support lists. To increase logging detail, add the following 
line to the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file.</para>
