<p>This component offers an interface to accept a delegated
credential, which it exposes as WS-Resources identified by an EPR
which it returns to the delegator. It allows co-hosted services access
to those credentials through shared Java state.</p>

<p>The delegation service exposes it's public key as a
ResourceProperty. The public key of the DS is contained in a
certificate chain for the host system (either as the EEC or a Proxy
Certificate issued by the EEC), allowing the client to verify the
validity of the public key. Clients of the DS delegate by binding a
Proxy Certificate to the exposed public key, and then passing the
Proxy Certificate to the DS via its interface.</p>

<p>Additionally the component allows for renewal of delegated
credentials by the delegator. Other entities may subscribe in order to
receive notification of renewals, allowing them to obtain the renewed
credential.</p>

<p> This component has a Delegation Factory Service and Delegation
Service. The Delegation Factory service exposes its public key as
resource property. A delegate call on the factory, creates a resource
in Delegation Service that represents the delegated credential. The
delegate call returns a Endpoint Reference (EPR) that can be further
used to refresh the credentials.</p>

<p> The services that are interested in the credenital, can register a
listener (an object that implements
<code>org.globus.delegation.DelegationRefreshListener</code>) with the
specific resource. This does not have a remote interface and hence
only services that are in the same hosting environment can register
interest. The credentials are pushed to the listener anytime a refresh
is done.</p>

<h2><a name="pubinterfaces"></a>Public interface</h2>
<p>The semantics and syntax of the APIs and WSDL for the component, along with
  descriptions of domain-specific structured interface data, can be found in
  the <a href="../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
  guide</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Usage scenarios</h2>

<h3> Client-side scenario </h3>

<ul> 

<li> Prior to delegating, the client needs to get information about
the public key of the Delegation Facory service, to be able to
delegate on that. Util API to do that has been described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#getCertChain">here</a>.

<li> The delegation client needs to get the public key of delegation
factory service, create a delegated credential on that and then use
the remote interface on the factory and delegate the credential. Util
API to do all of the above is described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#delegate">here</a>. The
Endpoint Reference that is returned by this operation can be
distributed to services that the user would like to delegate its
rights to.

<li> The user may need to refresh the delegated credential. The onus
is on the user to do this prior to expiration of the delegated
credential. If not, expired credentials are garbage collected and the
Endpoint Reference cannot be reused. AI that can be used to refresh is
described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#refresh">here</a>

</ul>

<h3> Service-side scenario </h3>

<p> This section describes the usage scenario where some service is provided with a delegated credential EPR and needs to access the credential. Typically, as a part of application the delegated credential EPR is sent to the service and and it is assumed that the delegation service is cohosted (that is runs in the same hosting environment).</p>

<p> The service need to create a listener object that implements
<code>org.globus.delegation.DelegationRefreshListener</code>
interface. When the listener is registered, the service checks to
ensure that delegator idenity matches either the identity set in the
subject object that is set as part of API or is the peer subject in
the current message context. Details about the API are described <a
href="./../WS_AA_Delegation_Service_Public_Interface.html#registerListener">here</a>.</p>

<p> Upon registering the listener, the delegated credential is set on
the listener. Any time the credential is refreshed, it is set on the
listener.</p>
