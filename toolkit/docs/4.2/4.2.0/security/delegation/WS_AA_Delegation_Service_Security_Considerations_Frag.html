<h3>Key Pair Reuse</h3>
<p>The current design re-uses the keys associated with the delegation service for each of the proxy certificates delegated to it. During a security review it was pointed out that while this was fine from a cryptographic standpoint, compromising this single long lived key pair may significantly extends the time for which a single intrusion (presumes a exploitable security flaw) is effective. </p>
<p>This can be remedied by either frequently regenerating the key pair used by the delegation service, which can be accomplished with a simple cron job, or by generating a new key pair for each new delegation. The later of these approaches requires changes to the design and may be adopted in future versions of the toolkit. For the time being we recommend the former approach should this issue concern you.</p>
