<para>The Delegation Service provides an interface for the delegation of

credentials to a hosting environment. This enables a single delegated credential to

be shared across multiple invocations of services on that hosting environment (e.g. it could be used for multiple GRAM job submissions or across

GRAM and RFT submissions.) It also provides a means for credential

renewal. </para>
