  <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Security Descriptors: The security descriptor schema has
        changed since GT 4.0.x and the descriptors from GT 4.0.x cannot be
        used as is.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Secure Conversation port type: The WS Addressing version in
        Java WS Core has been updated and the secure conversation port type
        has changed to reflect this. Therefore, GT 4.0.x secure conversation
        clients are incompatible with GT 4.2.x servers and vice
        versa.</simpara>
