  <title>Host credentials</title>
  <para>GT2 and GT3 services were set up to run with root owned <glossterm>host
    credentials</glossterm>. In GT4 most, but not all, services will run as the globus user. To
    allow the globus user to start services using host credentials the globus user needs to be able
    to access them. This requirement can be satisfied by making a copy of the root owned host
    credentials, i.e. the <glossterm>host certificate</glossterm> and <glossterm>private
    key</glossterm>, owned by the globus user. In GT4 this copy is assumed to be
      <filename>/etc/grid-security/container{cert,key}.pem</filename>. </para>
