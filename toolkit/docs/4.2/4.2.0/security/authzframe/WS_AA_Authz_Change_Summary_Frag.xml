  <title>Summary of Changes in WS Authorization Framework</title>
<indexterm type="authzframe"><primary>changes summary</primary></indexterm>
  <para>The server side authorization framework has been reworked to support
  attribute-based authorization. The APIs and framework have been enhanced to
  deal with a representation where each entity is identified by a bag of
  attributes.</para>

  <para>Also the default engine used for combining the individual Policy
  Decision Point(PDP) decision has been changed from a deny-override algorithm
  to a permit override scheme that looks for a chain of delegation of rights
  from the resource owner to the requestor.</para>

  <para>Refer <olink targetdoc="authzframeDeveloper"
  targetptr="authzframe-developer-archdes"></olink> for detailed information
  on the architecture.</para>

  <important>
    <para>The WS authorization interfaces have been frozen as of the GT 4.1.2
    release.</para>
  </important>

  <note>
    <para>All the PDPs that were distributed with the previous version have
    been ported to new framework and are supported.</para>

    <title>Java WS Authorization Code reorganization <emphasis>[post 4.1.3
    only]</emphasis></title>

    <para>The Java WS server side authorization code has been moved to a
    separate moduled called <code>authorization</code>. The work was tracked
    as part of [http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5559 Bug
    5559] and while this does not change any interface on the server side, it
    seperates the code from the Jva WS Core module.</para>

    <para>A migration guide, that outlines the changes needed for services
    that build on Java WS Core is provided <ulink
    url="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Java_WS_Core/Independent_Java_Authz_Module">here</ulink>.</para>
