    <para>The Authorization Framework component provides the infrastructure to process attributes
        and protect resource access based on access policy. It allows for authorization policy to be
        configured and enforced at various levels of granularity (container, service or resource).
        It also provides client side authorization to allow clients to authorize the services they
        access.  The framework is pluggable and can be configured to use custom mechanisms for attribute
        collection and policy evaluation. It also provides multiple authorization module
        implementations; for example, support for gridmap-based authorization, a callout module that
        uses the SAML protocol to query a external service for an authorization decision and
    such.</para>
