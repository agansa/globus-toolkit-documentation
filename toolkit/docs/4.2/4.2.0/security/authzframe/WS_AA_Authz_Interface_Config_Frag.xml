  <para>The authorization framework can be configured at the resource, service
or container level.  Configuration settings are specified  in security descriptors. The descriptors can be
read  from a file or can be created programatically. Refer to <ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/security/authzframe/security_descriptor.html#configDesc">Configuring security descriptors</ulink> for
more details.</para>
  <para>Authorization configuration involves setting a chain of
authorization schemes (also known as Policy Decision Points (PDPs)). When a authorization decision needs to be made the PDPs in the chain are evaluated in turn to arrive at a permit or deny decision. The combining rule for results from the individual PDPs is currently &quot;permit overrides&quot;, that is all PDPs have to evaluate to permit for the chain to evaluate as permit. </para>
