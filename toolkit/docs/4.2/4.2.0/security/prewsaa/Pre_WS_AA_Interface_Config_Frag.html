This section describes the configuration steps required to:
<ul>
<li>Determine whether or not to trust certificates issued by a particular
Certificate Authority (CA),</li>
<li>Provide appropriate default values for use by the
<code>grid-cert-request</code> command, which is used to generate
certificates,</li>
<li>Request <i>service certificates</i>, used by services to authenticate
themselves to users, and</li>
<li>Specify identity mapping information.</li>
</ul>
In general, Globus tools will look for a configuration file in a
user-specific location first, and in a systemwide location if no
user-specific file was found.  The configuration commands described
here may be run by administrators to create systemwide defaults, and by
individuals to override those defaults.
[TODO:  Add a reference to an overview document]
<h3>Configuring Globus to Trust a Particular Certificate Authority</h3>
The Globus tools will trust certificates issued by a CA if (and only if) it
can find information about that CA in the trusted certificate directory.
[TODO: link to the environment fragment, which explains where the
trusted certificates directory is]
The
following two files must exist in that directory for each trusted CA:
<table>
<tr>
<td><code><i>cert_hash</i>.0</code></td>
<td>The trusted CA certificate.</li>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><i>cert_hash</i>.signing_policy</code></td>
<td>A configuration file defining the distinguished names of certificates
signed by the CA.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p />
Pre-WS Globus components will honor a certificate only if:
<ul>
<li>its CA certificate
exists (with the appropriate name) in the <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> directory,
and</li>
<li>the certificate's distinguished name matches the pattern described in
the signing policy file.</li>
</ul>
WSRF-based components ignore the signing policy file and will honor
all valid certificates issued by trusted CAs.
<p />
The <i>cert_hash</i> that appears in the file names above is the hash of
the CA certificate, which can be found by running the command:
<pre>
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/openssl x509 -hash -noout &lt; <i>ca_certificate</i>
</pre>
Some CAs provide tools to install their CA certificates and signing policy
files into the trusted certificates directory.  You can, however, create
a signing policy file by hand; the signing policy file has the following
format:
<pre>
   access_id_CA X509 '<i>CA Distinguished Name</i>'
   pos_rights globus CA:sign
   cond_subjects globus '"<i>Distinguished Name Pattern</i>"'
</pre>
In the above, the <i>CA Distinguished Name</i> is the subject name of the
CA certificate, and the <i>Distinguished Name Pattern</i> is a string
used to match the distinguished names of certificates granted by the CA.
Some very simple wildcard matching is done -- if the
<i>Distinguished Name Pattern</i> ends with a '*', then any distinguished
name that matches the part of the CA subject name before the '*' is considered
a match.  Note:  the <code>cond_subjects</code> line may contain a space-separated list of distinguished name patterns.
<h3>Configuring Globus to Create Appropriate Certificate Requests</h3>
The <code>grid-cert-request</code> command, which is used to create certificates,
uses the following configuration files:
<p />
<table>
<tr>
<td><code>globus-user-ssl.conf</code></td>
<td>defines the distinguished name to
use for a user's certificate request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>globus-host-ssl.conf</code></td>
<td>defines the distinguished name for a
host (or service) certificate request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>grid-security.conf</code></td>
<td>a base configuration file used by the
above configuration files.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p />
Many CAs provide tools to install configuration files called
<code>globus-user-ssl.conf.<i>cert_hash</i></code>,
<code>globus-host-ssl.conf.<i>cert_hash</i></code>, and
<code>grid_security.conf.<i>cert_hash</i></code>
in the trusted certificates directory.  The command:
<pre>
   grid-cert-request -ca <i>cert_hash</i>
</pre>
will create a certificate request based on the specified CA's configuration
files.  The command:
<pre>
   grid-cert-request -ca
</pre>
will list the available CAs and let the user choose which one to create a
request for.
<p />
You can specify a default CA for certificate requests (i.e., a CA that
will be used if <code>grid-cert-request</code> is invoked without the
<code>-ca</code> flag) by making the following symbolic links (where
<i>GRID_SECURITY</i> is the grid security directory [TODO: link to environment
fragment] and <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> is the trusted CA directory:
<pre>
   ln -s <i>GRID_SECURITY</i>/globus-user-ssl.conf \
         <i>TRUSTED_CA</i>/globus-user-ssl.conf.<i>cert_hash</i>
   ln -s <i>GRID_SECURITY</i>/globus-host-ssl.conf \
         <i>TRUSTED_CA</i>/globus-host-ssl.conf.<i>cert_hash</i>
   ln -s <i>GRID_SECURITY</i>/grid_security.conf \
         <i>TRUSTED_CA</i>/grid_security.conf.<i>cert_hash</i>
</pre>
<h3>Requesting Service Certificates</h3>
Different CAs use different mechanisms for issuing end-user
certificates; some use mechanisms that are entirely web-based, while
others require you to generate a certificate request and send it to
the CA. If you need to create a certificate request for a
service certificate, you can do so by running:
<pre>
    grid-cert-request -host <i>hostname</i> -service <i>service_name</i>
</pre>
where <i>hostname</i> is the fully-qualified name of the host on which
the service will be running, and <i>service_name</i> is the name of the
service.  This will create the following three files:
<table>
<tr>
<td><code><i>GRID_SECURITY/service_name/service_name</i>cert.pem</code></td>
<td>
An empty file.  When you receive your actual service certificate from your CA,
you should place it in this file.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><i>GRID_SECURITY/service_name/service_name</i>cert_request.pem</code></td>
<td>
The certificate request, which you should send to your CA.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><i>GRID_SECURITY/service_name/service_name</i>key.pem</code></td>
<td>
The private key associated with your certificate request, encrypted with
the pass phrase that you entered when prompted by <code>grid-cert-request</code>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The <code>grid-cert-request</code> command recognizes several other useful
options; you can list these with:
<pre>
    grid-cert-request -help
</pre>
<h3>Specifying Identity Mapping Information</h3>
Several Globus services map distinguished names (found in certificates) to
local identities (e.g., unix logins).  These mappings are maintained in
the <i>gridmap</i> file.
[TODO:  link to the environment fragment,
which tells how to find the gridmap file]
A gridmap line of the form:
<pre>
   "<i>Distinguished Name</i>" <i>local_name</i>
</pre>
maps the distinguished name <i>Distinguished Name</i> to the local name
<i>local_name</i>.
A gridmap line of the form:
<pre>
   "<i>Distinguished Name</i>" <i>local_name1</i>,<i>local_name2</i>
</pre>
maps <i>Distinguished Name</i> to both <i>local_name1</i> and
<i>local_name2</i>; any number of local user names may occur in the
comma-separated local name list.
<p />
Several tools exist to manage gridmap files.
To add an entry to the gridmap file, run:
<pre>
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-add-entry \
        -dn "<i>Distinguished Name</i>" \
        -ln <i>local_name</i>
</pre>
To delete an entry from the <i>gridmap</i> file, run:
<pre>
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-delete-entry \
        -dn "<i>Distinguished Name</i>" \
        -ln <i>local_name</i>
</pre>
To check the consistency of the <i>gridmap</i> file, run
<pre>
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-check-consistency
</pre>
<p>These commands recognize several useful options, including a
<code>-help</code> option, which lists detailed usage information.
<p>
The location of the <i>gridmap</i> file is determined as follows:
<ol>
<li>If the <code>GRIDMAP</code> environment variable is set, the <i>gridmap</i>
file location is the value of that environment variable.</li>
<li>Otherwise:
<ul>
<li>If the user is root (uid 0), then the <i>gridmap</i> file is
<code>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</code>.
<li>Otherwise, the <i>gridmap</i> file is
<code>$HOME/.gridmap</code>.
</ul>
</ol>
