<para>
The Globus Toolkit Pre-Web Services Authentication and Authorization
component provides APIs and tools for authentication, authorization and certificate management.   </para>
<para>The authentication API   is built using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technologies, e.g. X.509 Certificates and TLS. In addition to authentication it        
         features a delegation mechanism based upon X.509 Proxy Certificates. </para>
<para>Authorization support takes the form of a couple of APIs. The first provides a generic authorization API that allows callouts  to perform access control based on the client&apos;s credentials
(i.e. the X.509 certificate chain). The second provides a simple acces control list  combined that also maps  authorized remote entities to local (system) user names. The second mechanism also provides callouts that allow third parties to override the default behavior and is currently  used in the Gatekeeper and GridFTP servers.</para>
<para>In addition to the above there are various lower level APIs and tools for managing, discovering and querying certificates .</para>
