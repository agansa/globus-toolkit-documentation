<simpara>During host authorization, the toolkit treats DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot; as equivalent to &quot;hostname.edu&quot;. This means that if a service was setup to do host authorization and hence accept the certificate &quot;hostname.edu&quot;, it would also accept certificates with DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot;. </simpara> 

<simpara> The feature is in place to allow a multi-homed host folowing a &quot;hostname-interface&quot; naming convention, to have a single host certificate. For example, host &quot;grid.test.edu&quot; would also accept likes of &quot;grid-1.test.edu&quot; or &quot;grid-foo.test.edu&quot;. </simpara>

<note><simpara>The wildcard character &quot;*&quot; matches only name of the hostand not domain components. This means that &quot;hostname.edu&quot; will not match &quot;hostname-foo.sub.edu&quot;, but will match &quot;host-foo.edu&quot;.</simpara></note>

<note><simpara>If a host was set up to accept &quot;hostname-1.edu&quot;, it will not accept any of &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot;.</simpara></note>

<simpara>A <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2969">bug</ulink> has been opened to see if this feature needs to be modfiied.
