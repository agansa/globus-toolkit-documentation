    <title>GAA and authorization callout configuration</title>
    <para>GT 3 introduced the notion of authorization callouts.  These callouts are configured via configuration files discovered as described in <olink targetdoc="prewsaaPI" targetptr="prewsaa-pi-env"/>.  When installing GT4 on a system on which these configuration files already exist, it is important to either update them for GT4 (since these files contain version specific informations) or to remove them from any of the locations in which  GT4 is looking for these configuration files.</para>
    <note>
      <simpara>If you plan to use GT3 and GT4 on the same system, you will need to short circuit the search algorithm for these configuration files by specifying the correct location for these files via the <envar>GSI_AUTHZ_CONF</envar> and <envar>GSI_GAA_CONF</envar> environment variables.</simpara>
