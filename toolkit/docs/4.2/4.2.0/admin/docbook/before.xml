	<title>Before you begin</title>

	<para>
		Before you start installing the Globus Toolkit <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>,
		there are a few things you should consider. The toolkit
		contains many subcomponents, and you may only be
		interested in some of them.
	</para>

	<para>
		There are non-web services implementations of:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>Security (Non-WS Authentication and Authorization)</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>File Transfers GridFTP</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>Resource Management (GRAM2)</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>Replica Location Service</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>and Information Services (MDS2). </simpara></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	<important>
		<simpara>These all run on Unix platforms only.</simpara>
	</important>
	
	<para>Additionally, there are WSRF implementations of:</para>
	
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><simpara>Security (Delegation Service, ...?)</simpara></listitem>
				<listitem><simpara>Resource Management (GRAM4)</simpara></listitem>
				<listitem><simpara>Reliable File Transfer (RFT)</simpara></listitem>
				<listitem><simpara>and Information Services (Index Service).</simpara></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
	
		<important>
			<simpara>All the Java clients to these services run on both Windows and Unix. The
				WSRF GRAM service requires infrastructure that only runs on Unix systems.</simpara>
		</important>

	<para>
		Therefore, if you are new to the toolkit and want to
		experiment with all of the components, you may want
		to use a Unix system. If you are interested in the
		Windows development, you may restrict yourself to the
		Java-based software.
