        <section id="javawscore-migrating-wsdl-gwsdl">
          <title>GWSDL</title>
          <para> GT3 used <computeroutput>GWSDL</computeroutput> to describe service messages and
            operations. GT4 uses standard <glossterm baseform="Web Services Description Language"
              >WSDL</glossterm> with one extensibility attribute to describe resource properties.
            Please see the <ulink
              url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrf/2004/06/wsrf-WS-ResourceProperties-1.2-draft-04.pdf"
              >WS-ResourceProperties</ulink> specification for details on expressing the resource
            properties in <computeroutput>WSDL</computeroutput>. </para>
        </section>
        <section id="javawscore-migrating-wsdl-porttype">
          <title>Port Types</title>
          <para> In GT3 every service inherited some basic operations and functionality (from
              <computeroutput>GridService</computeroutput> port type) as required by the OGSI
            specification. However, in GT4 there is no such requirement (because the <glossterm
              baseform="Web Services Resource Framework">WSRF</glossterm>/<glossterm
              baseform="Web Services Notification">WSN</glossterm> specifications do not require
            it). Also, the <computeroutput>Factory</computeroutput> port type defined in the OGSI
            specification does not exist in WSRF/WSN specifications. Therefore, there is no standard
            create operation or functionality provided by GT4. </para>
        </section>
        <section id="javawscore-migrating-wsdl-formatting">
          <title>WSDL formatting</title>
          <para> GT3 relied on <emphasis>wrapped</emphasis> formatting of the WSDL. GT4 uses
            standard <emphasis>document</emphasis> formatting. This change introduces differences in
            how the Java interface for the service looks. Please see the <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
              targetptr="javawscore-developer-archdes">design document</olink> and the <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
              targetptr="javawscore-developer-DocumentLiteral">document/literal</olink> section for
            more details. </para>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="javawscore-migrating-developing">
        <title>Developing services</title>
        <para> In GT3, the business logic of the service and the state were coupled together in one
          class. In GT4, the business logic and the state are decoupled and placed in two separate
          classes. The business logic is put in a <emphasis>service</emphasis> class while the state
          is put in a <emphasis>resource</emphasis> class. The <emphasis>service</emphasis> is
          stateless while the <emphasis>resource</emphasis> is stateful. Also, GT4 introduces
            <glossterm>ResourceHome</glossterm> classes that are responsible for managing and
          discovering resources. Please see the <olink targetdoc="javawscorePI" targetptr="javawscore-apis">programming
            model overview</olink> for details. </para>
        <para> Even though a GT4 developer needs to modify two or three separate files the coding
          effort is about the same as in GT3. </para>
      </section>
      <section id="javawscore-migrating-configuring">
        <title>Configuring services</title>
        <para> In GT3, most of the configuration information was stored in the
            <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> file. In GT4, since the business
          logic and state were decoupled, the service information is still kept in
            <glossterm>server-config.wsdd</glossterm> but resource information is now placed in the
          new <glossterm>jndi-config.xml</glossterm> file. Please see the <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
            targetptr="javawscore-developer-JNDIDetails">JNDI</olink> section for more details.
