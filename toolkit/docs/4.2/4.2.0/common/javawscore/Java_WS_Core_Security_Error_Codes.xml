<section id="javawscore-sec-error-jwssec-248"><title>[JWSSEC-248] Secure container requires valid credentials</title>

<para>This error occurs when globus-start-container is run without any valid credentials. Either a proxy certificate or service/host certificate needs to be configured for the container to start up

<orderedlist>
    <listitem>If you are not looking to start up a container that uses GSI Secure Transport, which is used by the container by default, use "globus-start-container -nosec". You will be able to use insecure clients and services. However, this also implies that if you have not configured individual services with credentials, you will not be able to securely access the service.</listitem>
   <listitem>If you are running a personal container, generate proxy certificate. If proxy certificate is not in default, configure container security descriptor as described Configuring Container Security Descriptor</listitem>
