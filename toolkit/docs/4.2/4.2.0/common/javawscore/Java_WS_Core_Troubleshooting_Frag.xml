    <para> In general, if you want to investigate a problem on your own please see <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
            targetptr="javawscore-developer-debugging"/> for details on how to turn on debugging.
        Also, please note that most of the command line clients have a <parameter>-debug</parameter>
        option that will display more detailed error messages, including the error stack traces.
        Also, <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/email-archive-search.php">searching the mailing
            lists</ulink> such as <ulink url="mailto:gt-user@globus.org">gt-user@globus.org</ulink>
        or <ulink url="mailto:jwscore-user@globus.org">jwscore-user@globus.org</ulink> (before
        posting a message) can also be very fruitful. Finally, if you think you have found a bug
        please report it in our <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</ulink>
        system. Please include as much as detail about the problem as possible.</para>
