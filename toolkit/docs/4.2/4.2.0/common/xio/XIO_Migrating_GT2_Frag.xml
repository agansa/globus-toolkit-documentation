<para>Globus XIO is a new component as of Globus 3.2.  Previous versions
        of Globus provided an API called globus_io.  
        XIO is a replacement for globus_io; 
        however a compatibility layer exists to allow full backward
       compatibility for applications written against globus_io.  For users
        familiar with globus_io the learning curve for XIO will be very
        small.  The APIs use the same event model and only significantly
        differ in connection establishment.
