<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p><font color="purple">
Globus XIO is based on an event based asynchronous programming model.
This model is described in great detail at:

http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/developer/globus-async.html

In short, with Globus XIO connections are opened and closed.  While open
read and write requests are posted with a callback function pointer 
given by the
user.  When the event completes the given callback is called.
