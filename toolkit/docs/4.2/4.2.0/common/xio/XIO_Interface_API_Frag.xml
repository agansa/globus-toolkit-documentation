<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>
<para>
Globus XIO is based on an event based asynchronous programming model.
This model is described in great detail at:
  <ulink url="&docpath;globus-async.html">Asynchronous Event Handling</ulink>.
  In short, with Globus XIO, connections are opened and closed. While open, read
  and write requests are posted with a callback function pointer given by the
user.  When the event completes, the given callback is called.
