GSS Major Status: Unexpected Gatekeeper or Service Name
globus_gsi_gssapi: Authorization denied: The name of the remote entity
  (/C=US/O=Globus Alliance/OU=Service/CN=host/grid.example.org), and the

  <entry>Service is not running with the expected security credential.</entry>
  <entry>
Verify that the service credential being presented by the service (first
parenthesized name) is a reasonable certificate name for the service. If so,
set the GLOBUS_SOAP_MESSAGE_PEER_IDENTITY_KEY attribute on the soap message
handle to that identity. For most command-line wsrf tools, this can be done by
passing it as an argument to the -z command-line parameter.

ws_addressing: Addressing header is a draft version of WS Addressing:

  <entry>The service is running on a container which is using a draft version of the WS-Addressing specification. This was used by GT 4.0.x</entry>
