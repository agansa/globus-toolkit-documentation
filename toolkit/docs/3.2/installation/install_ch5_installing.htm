<h1>Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2</h1>
<p>There are many ways to install the Globus Toolkit: binary vs source, root vs 
non-root, and core-only vs by component vs full installation. We will attempt to 
cover all of the issues here.</p>
<h2> Root vs non-root</h2>
<p> As a security precaution, we recommend installing GT3 as a <b>non-root user</b>. 
This enables an important feature of the Toolkit: limited access to the Globus 
environment to protect <font color="#FF00FF">blah blah</font>.</p>
<p> <b>Tip from IBM:</b> Instead of switching users repeatedly from within one 
screen, have a separate window open for each user.</p>
<h2> Installation Options</h2>
<p> Since the Toolkit is a collection of tools that can be used interchangeably 
with core, you can install the Toolkit in many ways: &lt;list the options&gt;.</p>
<p> The procedure tables for binary and source installation below, takes you 
through a basic installation of GT 3.2 Core as well as the Index Service,
<font color="#FF00FF">blah blah </font>components. Detailed installation per 
component is described in the appropriate component System Administrator's 
Manuals (links will be provided at the end of the procedure).</p>
<p> After this installation, you will be able to run a test grid service
<font color="#FF00FF">(what else can you or can't you do?)</font></p>
<h2> Binary Installation</h2>
<p> as non-root user</p>
<p> <b>GRAM Note:</b> If you plan to run the GT3 GRAM service please note the 
section on setting up the required setuid scripts below. We recommend that you 
install as the user that will run the GT3 GRAM service. </p>
<p> untar GT3 binary package</p>
<p> install GT3 binary package</p>
<p>Open the .tar.gz, and run &quot;./install-gt3 /path/to/install&quot;. Make sure that 
ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME are set, and that 'ant' and 'java' are on your PATH. If 
you are using JDK 1.3.1, make sure JAAS is in your CLASSPATH before you run the 
installer. </p>
<p>Don't panic! GPT may spit out some WARNING messages at you. Don't worry about 
Perl version complaints. It works with 5.6.1, 5.8.0, and 5.005. </p>
<p> Proceed to the
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.0/ogsa/docs/admin/configuration.html">
Configuration</a> section for information on acquiring certificates and setting 
up MMJFS. Until you have run &quot;install-gt3-mmjfs&quot;, you will still need your 
installer directory. </p>
<ul>
	<li>If you just want to test the Grid Service, <font color="#FF00FF">go to 
	deploy and configure</font></li>
	<li>If you want to use A, go to &lt;link&gt;</li>
	<li>If you want to use B, go to &lt;link&gt;</li>

<h2> Source Installation</h2>
<p> as non-root user</p>
<p> <b>GRAM Note:</b> If you plan to run the GT3 GRAM service please note the 
section on setting up the required setuid scripts below. We recommend that you 
install as the user that will run the GT3 GRAM service. </p>
<p> untar GT3 source package</p>
<p> install GT3 source package</p>
<p>Open the .tar.gz, and run &quot;./install-gt3 /path/to/install&quot;. Make sure that
