&gt; <a href="index.htm">Installation Guide</a> &gt; Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2 &lt; </p>

<h1>Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2</h1>
<p>There are many options for installing the Globus Toolkit: root vs 
non-root, and binary vs source, core-only vs by component vs full installation. </p>
<h2> Root vs Non-root</h2>
<p> As a security precaution, we recommend installing GT3 as a <b>non-root user</b>. 
This enables an important feature of the Toolkit: limited access to the Globus 
environment to protect.</p>
<h2> Installing by Service </h2>
<p> Since the Toolkit has many components, you can install only the ones you need. On the Globus Toolkit 3.2 Download page, you will find the following options:</p>
<table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#all">All Services </a> </td>
    <td><p>Installs all of GT 2.x (pre-Web Services) and all of GT 3.x (Web Services) </p>    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#base">All GT 3.x  Services</a></td>
    <td><p>Installs all of GT 3.x with only the required GT 2.x programs</p>    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#core">Core</a></td>
    <td><p>Installs only the GT 3.x Core, which is pure Java</p>    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#gars">GARS</a></td>
    <td>Installs only the higher level GT 3.x services (??what are all the higher level GT 3 svcs?) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#gt2-src">GT2 bundles</a></td>
    <td><p>Installs only the GT 2.x bundles</p>    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Binary vs Source  </h2>
<p> The source distribution contains source for the core framework as well as all samples, whereas the binary distribution only has the source for the samples. When downloading the source you can easily build your own binary distribution to work with (link to topic). The build and development environment is largely the same in both distributions. For consistency this guide assumes you have a binary distribution (either downloaded from the web, or created from a source cvs checkout) unless otherwise stated. The binary distribution does not require you to download any external tools to run the samples (apart from a Java VM), we however recommend that you also in this case download the build system we are using (Ant), in order to make it easier to build, and deploy the samples, as well as writing your own services. </p>
<h2>Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2 - Binary </h2>
<p> <b>Note:</b> If you plan to run the GT3 GRAM service we recommend that you 
install as the user that will run the GT3 GRAM service.</p>

<h2><a name="deploy"> Deploying to “standalone” container</a></h2>
<p> (ext links to tomcat/websphere?)</p>
<p> You can run the entire framework and all the samples inside of the standalone service container we provide. However it was mainly designed for testing purposes, so the framework can also be deployed in tomcat (4.0.6). </p>
<ol>
  <li>Type ant -Dtomcat.dir=$TOMCAT_HOME deployTomcat
  <li>Add .wsdl and .xsd MIME types to Tomcat server edit &lt;tomcat root&gt;/conf/web.xml file and add the following (anywhere in the web-app): </li>
</ol>
&lt;mime-mapping&gt; &lt;extension&gt;wsdl&lt;/extension&gt; &lt;mime-type&gt;text/xml&lt;/mime-type&gt; &lt;/mime-mapping&gt; &lt;mime-mapping&gt; &lt;extension&gt;xsd&lt;/extension&gt; &lt;mime-type&gt;text/xml&lt;/mime-type&gt; &lt;/mime-mapping&gt; When using the Sun Java Hotspot VM you may also want to increase your heap space for the tomcat engine. <br>
You can do this by setting the -Xmx flag to for instance -Xmx128m (128 MB max heap) in the CATALINA_OPTS environment.
<p>Note , there is a known problem with the AxisServlet in Tomcat causing an empty document to be returned with a successful HTTP status if the tomcat configuration is broken. To debug it further please check the tomcat logs in &lt;tomcat root&gt;/logs/ or the log4j logs in the server (see section 7). The error returned to the client will be a SaxException and look something like: 'Line=1: The root element is required in a well-formed document'. </p>
