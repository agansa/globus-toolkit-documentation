<h2>Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2</h2>
<p>This page will expand on the options you will have when installing the Toolkit. 
Then the <a href="#sourceinstall">Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2 - Source Installers</a> topic will cover the install itself.</p>

<p>This page contains the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#rootNonroot">Root vs Non-root</a></li>
  <li><a href="#byservice">By service</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bininstall">Installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2 - Binary Installers</a></li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="rootNonroot"> Root vs Non-root</a></h2>
<p> As a security precaution, we recommend installing GT3 as a <b>non-root user</b>. </p>
<p>GT3 is designed to run as few components at elevated privileges as possible.
  As you will see in the <a href="install_config.html">Configuration</a> section,
  there are two files that will be made <strong>setuid</strong>. One of these needs to be <strong>setuid
  root</strong> in order to run a User Hosting Environment as another user. The other
  needs to be setuid to an account which owns the host certificate. That can
  either be a separate non-root user, or you could choose to have that be root
  also. You don't need to make the certificate owner choice right now; it will be covered in the
  Configuration section.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong> It is important that the user ID under which you want
  to run GRAM is a member of the group ID that owns the <code>launch_uhe_setuid</code> program
(see <a href="install_config_resource.html">Configuring Resource Management </a>.)  That will
be the case if you both install as user globus and launch the container as user globus.</p>
<h2><a name="byservice"> By Service</a></h2>
<p> Since the Toolkit has many components, you can install only the ones you
  need. On the <a href="../../../downloads/3.2/index.html">Globus
  Toolkit 3.2 Download</a> page, you will find the following options:</p>

   <code>rpm -q glibc</code> to choose between the glibc2.2/glibc2.3
   choices.  If the first two digits are "2.3", like
   "glibc-2.3.2-27.9", then you would use the glibc-2.3 installer.  If
   the first two digits are "2.2", like "glibc-2.2.93-5", then you
   would use the glibc-2.2 installer.
   <p><b>WARNING</b>: These binaries are only known to work on
   the distribution used to generate them (RH7.3 for the glibc2.2,
   and Fedora Core 1 for glibc2.3).  We have had bug reports 
   even on machines which report the same Major.Minor.Point release of
   glibc, but are from a different distribution.  If you experience
   GridFTP errors with the binary installation, please rebuild from source.

<p>WS Core is installed by the GT3 Base and GT3 All installers.  If you use

useful for gridservice developers who wish to write new applications,
but don't need any of the higher-level services.</p>
