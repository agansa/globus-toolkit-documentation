<h1>Setting up Resource Management/GRAM/MMJFS</h1>
		<p>   
		MMJFS (also known as the JobManager) is a feature of the Resource 
		Management component of the Globus Toolkit. Information related to 
		installing MMJFS is <i>here</i>.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>   Although it must be installed with the Globus Toolkit, MMJFS is an 
		option that only needs to be configured if you want to use <i>GRAM</i>.</p>
		<p>Requirements</p>
		<p>Read: &quot;topic&quot; </p>
		<p>   Before you can configure MMJFS, you must have the following as a 
		result of the <i>Setting up security</i> procedure (&lt;link&gt;):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>host certificate</li>
			<li>user account with a user certificate</li>
		    <li>trusted CA certificate 
in <font face="Courier New">/etc/grid-security/certificates</font></li>
		<li><font face="Courier New">setuid globus-grim</font> executable (?) </li>
		</ul>
		<p>First you must add authorizations for those who are allowed to submit 
		jobs:</p>
		<p>1. Create <font face="Courier New">/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</font>. 
		<br>
				The syntax is one line per user, with the certificate subject followed 
		by the user account name:</p>
		<p class="command">&quot;/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=<i>organization</i>/CN=<i>name</i>&quot;
		<i>username</i> </p>
		<p>You can get the certificate DN by running <font face="Courier New">grid-cert-info -subject</font> 
		as 
your non-globus user.<br>
<br>2. ??Now you should be able to use the Fork service 
		[service is now available, you can use a client]. That concludes the required 
section if you want to use Resource Management.</p>
		<p class="style1">what did this actually do? what can you do now before they have to refer to the GRAM Sys Admin guide??</p>
		<p>For more information, see the <em>GT3 GRAM System Administrator's Guide</em>. <br>
          <br>
          3. <b>If you have a scheduler</b>, 
		    find the scheduler 
    bundle from the installer you downloaded (look under <font face="Courier New">schedulers/</font>) 
		    and run <font face="Courier New">gpt-build</font> to install it. (test)<br>
	      <br>
	      4. <b>If you need to customize the jobmanager for your scheduler type</b>, 
    for instance to change between <font face="Courier New">rsh</font> and <font face="Courier New">ssh</font>, edit the following file [to affect 
		    how jobs are submitted].</p>
		<p class="command">$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/[scheduler].pm</p>
