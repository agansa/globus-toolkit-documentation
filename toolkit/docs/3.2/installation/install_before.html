<h1>Globus Toolkit 3.2: Installation Guide: Before You Begin</h1>
<p>Before you start installing the Globus Toolkit 3.2, there are a few things you should consider. </p>
<p class="style1">don't think i really need this page - could incorporate the few notes here within other pages... </p>
<p class="style1">Agreed.  I was thinking of the "how to choose which
download you want", which is also elsewhere.  Also, there's the question
of user account creation, but that's covered in the install section.
This probably isn't a bad place to stick a conceptual overview, though.</p>
<p class="style1">system requirements!! </p>
<h2>Required Reading</h2>
<p>If you are new to the Grid, make sure you understand these concepts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Toolkit Concepts</li>
	<li>OGSA Physiology</li>
</ul>
<h2> Servers: naming and addressing</h2>
<p>??? </p>
<h2> Users and user groups (GRAM)</h2>
<p> If you are interested in the resource management tool, GRAM, consider  your users and user groups. You will need users to install 
both the toolkit <em>and</em> the certificate authority as well as submit jobs.</p>

<p> <b>Note:</b> It is important that the user ID under which you want to run 
GRAM is a member of the group ID that owns the <span class="code">launch_uhe_setuid</span> program (see 
<a href="install_config_resource.htm">Configuring Resource Management</a>.)</p>
