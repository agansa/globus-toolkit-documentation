<li><a name="488">&quot;Information Services fails to build with gcc 3.2
during compilation of cyrus-sasl.&quot;</a><br>
<p>This is a problem that stems from the following warning that
appears in gcc 3.2:</p>
<p class="command">
cc1: warning: changing search order for system directory "/usr/local/include"<br>
cc1: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system
directory<br>
</p>
<p>There are several possible solutions.  First, you can upgrade your
compiler to a more recent version of gcc.  Alternately, you can patch
gcc 3.2, or use a workaround wrapper script.  These are available in
comments 16 and 17 in <a
href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=488">bug
488</a> in the Globus Project's bugzilla.</p></li>
<li><a name="hang">&quot;My build is taking a very long time to complete.
I have left it running for hours, but nothing seems to be happening.

1.3.1.&quot;</a><br>
<p>JDK 1.3.1 sometimes hangs for no apparent reason during the
compilation of our code.  It does not happen every time.  If you exit
the build and try again, it might work.  We recommend you upgrade to a
newer JDK if you experience this trouble.</p></li>
