<h1>GridFTP: User's Guide </h1>
<p>Using GridFTP from a user's perspective is fairly easy.&nbsp; The client provided
  with the Globus Toolkit is called <strong><a href="globusurlcopy.html">globus-url-copy</a></strong>.&nbsp; It
  is a scriptable, command line client.&nbsp; It is relatively easy to use and
  gets its name from the fact that it can access multiple protocols that you
can specify in a URL. </p>

<h2><a name="before"></a>Before you begin </h2>
<p>YOU MUST HAVE A CERTIFICATE TO USE globus-url-copy!</p>
<table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">1</td>
    <td valign="top"><p>First, as with all things Grid, you <strong>must</strong> have a valid proxy certificate
        to run globus-url-copy.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If you do not have a certificate, you must obtain one.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If you are doing this for testing in your own environment, the <a href="../../installation/install_config_req.html">Simple
          CA</a> provided with the Globus Tookit should suffice.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If not, you must contact the Virtual Organization (VO) with which you
        are associated to see from whom you should request a certificate.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>One common source is the DOE Science Grid CA, although you must confirm
        whether or not the resources you wish to access will accept their certificates.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Instructions for proper installation of the certificate should be provided
    from the source of the certificate. </p></td>

        this by running: </p>

<h2><a name="interactiveclients"></a>Interactive clients for GridFTP </h2>
<p>The Globus Project does <strong>not</strong> provide an interactive client
  for GridFTP.&nbsp; Any
  normal FTP client will work with a GridFTP server, but it cannot take advantage
  of the advanced features of GridFTP.&nbsp; The interactive clients listed below
  take advantage of the advanced features of GridFTP.&nbsp;</p>
<p> There
  is no endorsement implied by their presence here.&nbsp; We make no
  assertion as to the quality or approriateness of these tools, we simply provide
  this for your convenience.&nbsp; We
  will <strong>not</strong> answer questions, accept bugs, or in any way shape
  or form be responsible for these tools, although they should have mechanisms
  of their own for such things. </p>
<p><strong>UberFTP</strong> was developed at the NCSA under the auspices of NMI and TeraGrid.&nbsp; It
  is available through NMI (a convenient place to get Globus and other tools
  as well, btw), or directly from NCSA:</p>
