<h1>GRAM: Key Concepts </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The Globus Toolkit includes a set of service components collectively referred
  to as the Globus Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM). GRAM simplifies the use
  of remote systems by providing a single standard interface for requesting and
  using remote system resources for the execution of "jobs". The most common
  use (and the best supported use) of GRAM is remote job submission and control.
  This is typically used to support distributed computing applications. </p>
<p>For most Grid-based projects, we recommend using GRAM as a project-wide standard
  for remote job submission and resource management. </p>
<p>GRAM is designed to provide a single common protocol and API for requesting
  and using remote system resources, by providing a uniform, flexible interface
  to, local job scheduling systems. The Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) provides
  mutual authentication of both users and remote resources using GSI (Grid-wide)
  PKI-based identities. GRAM provides a simple authorization mechanism based
  on GSI identities and a mechanism to map GSI identities to local user accounts. </p>
<p>GRAM reduces the number of mechanisms required for using remote resources
  (such as remote compute systems). Local systems may use a wide variety of management
  mechanisms (schedulers, queuing systems, reservation systems, and control interfaces),
  but users and application developers need to learn how to use only one (*GRAM*)
  to request and use these resources. This capability is consistent with the "hourglass" role
  played by most of the Globus Toolkit's components: GRAM is the neck of the
  hourglass, with applications and higher-level services (such as resource brokers
  or metaschedulers) above it and local control and access mechanisms below it,
  as shown in the below figure. Both sides need work only with GRAM, so the number
  of interactions, APIs, and protocols that need to be used are greatly reduced. </p>

<p>We expect GRAM to continue evolving rapidly within the OGSI setting (WS GRAM),
  as its protocol is standardized, and as richer job description and resource
  provisioning capabilities are added. </p>
<p>GRAM does not provide scheduling or resource brokering capabilities. A wide
  variety of metaschedulers and resource brokers that leverage GRAM mechanisms
  have been developed by other projects for the Pre-WS GRAM. Due to its recent June/July
  release, WS GRAM may not yet have been integrated into the various metaschedulers
  and resource brokers. However, we expect these applications will be updated
  to use WS GRAM. </p>
<p>GRAM does not provide accounting and billing features. It is assumed that
  these features-if needed-are being supplied by local management mechanisms
  such as a queuing system or scheduler. </p>
