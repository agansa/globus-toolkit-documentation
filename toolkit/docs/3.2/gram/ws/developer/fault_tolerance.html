<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>GT3 GRAM fault tolerance is managed by a coordinated set of
serviceContainer handlers and background sweeper tasks in both the MHE and
UHE.  Below is a diagram with descriptions of how it is accomplished.</p>

<p>For more information on GRID service persistence in the OGSA core framework, refer to the GT3 java programmers guide.

<h2>UHERestartHandler in the MHE</h2>

<p>The UHERestartHandler is containerHandler in the
Master Host Environment (MHE) that is installed when the
MasterManagedJobFactoryService is installed.  It is configured to
run once when the MHE is started.  The UHERestartHandler attempts to
restart any User Host Environments (UHEs) that were previously started
by the MHE.  For each UHE entry in the jobManPortMapping, it uses
the startLocalHostingEnv java method in Setuid.java to start the UHE.
This is the same method used by the MMJFS to start a UHE.</p>

<h2>UHESweeperTask in the MHE</h2>

<p>UHESweeperTask is a background task running in the MHE.  It is
configured to run every two hours.  It is responsible for restarting
"crashed" UHEs and updating the jobManPortMapping file when a UHE is
shutting itself down due to inactivity.

<p>To determine if a UHE has crashed, for each entry in the
jobManPortMapping, the UHESweeperTask pings the UHE's admin service to
determine if it is still alive.  If the ping fails, the UHESweeperTask
restarts the UHE on the same port.  If the restart fails, no further
attempts are made until the sweeper task is run again.

<p>To identify UHEs that are shutting down, the UHESweeperTask does a
findServiceData call for UHEActivity SDE in the UHE's Admin Service.
If the SDE is "Shutdown" then the jobManPortMapping file is purged of
the entry for that UHE.

<h2>SimpleTimestampHandler in the UHE</h2>

<p>This logs a timestamp everytime a message comes into the UHE.
This handler gets installed in the UHE at creation time.

<h2>UHEActivityTask in the UHE</h2>

<p>This is a UHE background sweeper task.  It monitors the activity
of UHE and sets the UHEActivity SDE in AdminService accordingly.
The UHEActivityTask SDE can have two values, "Active" or "Shutdown".
Active is set when the UHE has had a recent message or an active service
instance.  Shutdown is set when the UHE has no active service instances
and no messages have been received in the past 2 hours.  The UHE is
actually shutdown the *next* time the UHEActivityTask is run.

<h2>MHE services</h2>

<p>The persistent service in the MHE are restarted after the
UHERestartHandler is run.  Typically, this includes one or more MMJFSs
and a RIPS.

<h2>UHE services</h2>

<p>The persistent services in the UHE are MJFSs, MJS instances,
FileStreamFactoryServices, and FileStreamService instances.  Once a MJS
instance has been recovered, it resumes monitoring of the User's job.
