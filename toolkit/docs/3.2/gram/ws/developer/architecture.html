<h2>Architecture </h2>
<p>Below we walk through a typical WS GRAM service invocation from the point
  of view of the resource and the user. </p>

<ol>
  <li>The Master is configured to use the Redirector to redirect calls to it
    and use the Starter UHE module when there is not a running UHE for the user.
    A createService call on the Master uses the Redirector to invoke the Starter
    UHE module and start up a UHE. <br>
  <li>The Master publishes its handle to a remote registry (optional) <br>
  <li>A client submits a createService request which is received by the Redirector <br>
  <li>The Redirector calls the Starter UHE class which authorizes the request
    via the grid-mapfile to determine the local username and port to be used
    and constructs a target URL <br>
  <li>The Redirector attempts to forward the call to the said target URL. If
    it is unable to forward the call because the UHE is not up, the Launch UHE
    module is invoked <br>
  <li>The Launch UHE creates a new UHE process under the authenticated user's
    local uid <br>
  <li>The Starter UHE waits for the UHE to be started up (ping loop) and returns
    the target URL to the Redirector <br>
  <li>The Redirector forwards the createService call to the MJFS unmodified and
    mutual authentication/authorization can take place <br>
  <li>MJFS creates a new Managed Job Service (MJS) <br>
  <li>MJS submits the job into a back-end scheduling system <br>
  <li>Subsequent calls to the MJS from the client will be redirected through
    the Redirector <br>
  <li>RIPS providing data to the MJS instances and Master. It gathers data from
    the local scheduling system, file system, host info, ... <br>
  <li>FindServiceData requests to the Master will result in either an SDE returned
    (populated by the Service Data Aggregate) or redirected to the MJFS of the
    requestor's UHE <br>
  <li>In order to stream stdout/stderr back to the client, the MJS creates 2
    File Stream Factory Services (FSFS), one for stdout and one for stderr <br>
  <li>The MJS then creates the File Stream Services (FSS) instances as specified
    in the job request <br>
  <li>The grim handler is run in the UHE to create a user host certificate. The
    user host certificate is used for mutual authentication between the MJS service
    and the client. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Virtual Host Environment Redirector </h2>
<p>It accepts all incoming soap messages and redirects them to the User Host
  Environment. This component is part of Core. See core documentation for details. </p>
<h2>Starter UHE </h2>
<p>This java class is used by the Redirector to resolve the incoming calls to
  a user hosting environment. The gridmap file is used to obtain the username
  corresponding to a particular subject DN and one UHE is run per user on a machine.
<p>Mapping from the username to the port number of the UHE for that particular
  user is maintained in a configuration file.
<p>When a request to resolve a URL comes in and an entry is found in the configuration
  file, the target URL is constructed and returned to the Redirector. If the
  UHE on that port number is not up, the setuid/launch module is used to launch
  a UHE as the user.
<p>If an entry does not exist in the configuration file, a free port number is
  chosen, the setuid/launch module is used to start up a UHE on the particular
  port number as the user and the target URL is returned to the Redirector, after
  ensuring the UHE is running. The configuration file is also updated with this
  entry.
<h2>LAUNCH UHE </h2>
<p>A simple java class that is used to call a C program in order to start a new
  hosting environment under the user's account. The setuid C program does an
  su/fork/exec of a shell script that uses a java program to configure and startup
  the UHE. The C program needs to be "setuid" root. The path to the shell script
  is determined when the C program is compiled. This limits the root exposure
  to starting up a new hosting environment as a user.
<h2>Master </h2>
<p>The Master Managed Job Factory Service is responsible for exposing the virtual
  GRAM service to the outside world. It configures the Redirector to direct createService
  calls sent to it through the Startup UHE, and launch UHE in order to eventually
  end up unmodified to the MJFS. The Redirector is instructed to redirect subsequent
  createService calls sent to it to a user's hosting environment.
<p>The Master uses the Service Data Aggregator to collect and populate local
  Service Data Elements which represent local scheduler data (e.g. freenodes,
  totalnodes) and general host information (e.g. host cpu type, host OS). If
  the FSD request is for any known MJFS SDE, then is it redirected to he MJFS
  of the UHE. All other FSD queries are handled locally.
<h2>Managed Job Factory Service (MJFS) </h2>
<p>The Managed Job Factory Service is responsible for instantiating a new MJS
  when it receives a CreateService request. The MJFS stays up for the life of
  the UHE.
<h2>Managed Job Service (MJS) </h2>
<p>An OGSI service that given a job request specification can submit a job to
  a local scheduler, monitor its status and send notification. The MJS will start
  two File Streaming Factory Service (FSFS), one for the job's stdout and one
  for the job's stderr. The MJS starts the initial set of FSS instances as specified
  in the job specification. The FSFS's Grid Service Handles (GSH) are available
  in the SDE of the MJS, which will enable the client to start additional FSS
  instances of stdout/err or terminate existing FSS instances. The MJS destroys
  the stdout and stderr File Stream Factories during it's preDestroy operation.
<h2>File Stream Factory Service (FSFS) </h2>
<p>The File Stream Factory Service is responsible for instantiating a new File
  Stream Service instances when it receives a CreateService request. It exposes
  two SDE's: the path to the local file being streamed and the the current size
  of the file.
<h2>File Stream Service (FSS) </h2>
<p>An OGSI service that given a destination URL will stream from the local file
  the factory was created to stream (stdout or stderr) to the destination URL.
  It exposes two SDE's: The URL of the stream destination and a done flag indicating
  that the streamming of the file has been completed.
<h2>RIPS </h2>
<p>RIPS is a specialized notification service providing raw data about a resources
  scheduling system, file system, host system, etc. Some of the data may be privileged.
  The MJS instances will subscribe to RIPS for notification on job state changes.
  The Master will subscribe for data about the local scheduler (e.g free / total
  nodes), file system and host system information. </p>
