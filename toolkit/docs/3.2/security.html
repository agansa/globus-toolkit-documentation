<h1>Security  Documentation</h1>
<p>The following links will take you to documentation for the security
  components of the Globus Toolkit:</p>
<p><a href="gsi/index.html">GSI</a></p>

  <p>The Globus Toolkit uses the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) for enabling
    secure authentication and communication over an open network. GSI provides
    a number of useful services for Grids, including mutual authentication and
  single sign-on. </p>
  <p>The primary motivations behind the GSI are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The need for secure communication (authenticated and perhaps confidential)
      between elements of a computational Grid.
    <li>The need to support security across organizational boundaries, thus prohibiting
      a centrally-managed security system.
    <li>The need to support "single sign-on" for users of the Grid, including
      delegation of credentials for computations that involve multiple resources
      and/or sites. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>GSI is based on public key encryption, X.509 certificates, and the Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL) communication protocol. Extensions to these standards
    have been added for single sign-on and delegation. The Globus Toolkit's implementation
    of the GSI adheres to the Generic Security Service API (GSS-API), which is
    a standard API for security systems promoted by the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF). </p>
  <p><a href="cas/index.html">CAS</a></p>
  <p>Building on the Globus Toolkit™ Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), CAS
    allows resource providers to specify course-grained access control policies
    in terms of communities as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control
    policy management to the community itself. Resource providers maintain ultimate
    authority over their resources but are spared day-to-day policy administration
  tasks (e.g. adding and deleting users, modifying user privileges). </p>
