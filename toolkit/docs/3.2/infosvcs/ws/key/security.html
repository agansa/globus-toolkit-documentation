<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security mechanism used by the Globus Toolkit is the Grid Security Infrastructure
  (GSI), which enables the use of certificates and various files to provide authentication
  and authorization services.&nbsp; GSI is described in more detail in <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/security">GSI
Security Infrastructure</a>. </p>
<p>GSI is a library for providing generic security services for applications
  that will be run on the Grid.&nbsp; GSI provides programs to facilitate login
  to a variety of sites, while each site has its own flavor of security measures. </p>
<p>GSI provides a single sign-on authentication service, to identify a user for
  access to multiple Grid resources via one sign-on procedure.&nbsp; GSI also
  provides local control over access rights and mapping from global to local
  user identities. </p>
<p>OGSA provides two different GSI implementations.&nbsp; One is based on <strong>message-level
  security</strong>, and the other on <strong>transport-level security</strong>, as known from Version
  2 of the Globus Toolkit (GT2).&nbsp; Transport-level security is supported
  in order to be backwards compatible with GT2, and also to simplify integration
  with hosting environments without message-level security support.&nbsp; GSI
  defines protocols for mutual authentication, credential delegation, proxy signing,
  message protection, and authorization, and typically sits on top of a Secure
  Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) implementation. </p>
<p>The WS Index Service is compatible with the GT3.2 Grid Security 
Infrastructure, however by default, security is not enabled.&nbsp; Security can
 be enabled by adding a reference to a properly formatted security-config.xml
 file in the service descriptor for the Index Service.</p>

      Grid Security Infrastructure</a>. </p>
