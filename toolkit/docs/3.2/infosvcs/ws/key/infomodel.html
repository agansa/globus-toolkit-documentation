<h2> Information Model </h2>
<p>As mentioned above, each Grid service instance has a particular set of 
service
  data associated with it. The essence of the Index Service is to provide an 
interface for operations generating, aggregating, and querying this data. </p>
<p>This section presents a brief overview of OGSA and Globus Toolkit 3.0 concepts
  and terminology as related to the Index Service. More information on
  OGSA and GT3.2 can be found in the publications listed in the <a href="relateddocs.html">Related
  Documents</a> section. </p>
<p>The OGSA model comprises persistent services (typically a few) and transient
  services (potentially many).&nbsp; All services adhere to specified Grid service
  interfaces and behaviors.&nbsp; The interfaces correspond to WSDL portTypes
  and are used for managing the Grid service instances.&nbsp; The <em>GridService </em> portType
  is used to query and update the service data of a Grid Service instance and
  control the lifetime of the instance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The interfaces and functions most relevant to the Index Service can be summarized
  as follows: </p>
<h3>Factory </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Used to create a new Grid service instance via its CreateService operation.&nbsp; A
      Factory returns a Grid Service Handle (GSH) as described below, and maintains
      a set of Service Data Elements that can be queried. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Grid Service Handle (GSH) </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Returned by the Factory create operation.&nbsp; A GSH is a URL used to globally
    name a Grid service instance for all time.&nbsp; A GSH must be converted
    to a Grid Service Reference (see below) in order to use the service.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Grid Service Reference (GSR) </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Describes how a client can communicate with a Grid service instance.&nbsp; The
    HandleMap interface allows a client to map from a GSH to a GSR.&nbsp; While
    the GSH represents name only, the GSR includes binding information for transport
    protocol and data encoding format. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Query </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Provides extensible query language support.&nbsp; A Grid service instance
    maintains a set of Service Data Elements.&nbsp; The FindServiceData operation
    from the GridService interface is used to query this information.&nbsp; This
    is a standard, extensible query operation against a service's Service Data
    Elements, which may use either the simple default “by name” query or a more
    complex language like XPath or XQuery.&nbsp; The ogsi-find-service-data command
    (see <em><a href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/releases/final/docs/infosvcs/querysvcdata.html">Querying
    Service Data </a></em>) is the client to the query interface. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Registry </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Supports discovery by returning the GSHs of a set of Grid services.&nbsp; A
      Registry allows for soft-state registration of Grid services, in that a
    set of Grid services can periodically register their GSHs into a Registry
    service to allow for discovery of services in that set. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Notification </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The NotificationSource interface is used for client subscription, to register
    interest in a service.&nbsp; It sends notification messages about registered
    topics.&nbsp; These topics can be linked to arbitrary values (state values)
    generated by a service at runtime or linked to a service data element.&nbsp; The
    NotificationSink interface is used for asynchronous delivery of notification
    messages; it can be applied to dynamic discovery/registration services, monitoring,
    application error notification, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize, a Grid service instance is created by the Factory interface,
  which returns a GSH to identify the service.&nbsp; The GSH is converted to
  a GSR (which includes binding information) so that the service can be used.&nbsp; Service
  instances can be identified in a Registry, which can be used to support query
  or other operations on a given service.&nbsp; The Notification interface provides
  for subscription to and delivery of notification messages regarding service-related
  events. <br>
