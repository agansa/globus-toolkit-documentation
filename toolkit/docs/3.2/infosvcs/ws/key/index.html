<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This section continues our <a href="../../../key/index.html">overview of the 
Globus Toolkit and grid computing</a>.</p>
<p>Each <b>Grid service instance</b> has a particular set of service data associated 
      with it.&nbsp; The essence of the Index Service is to provide an interface for 
      operations generating, aggregating and querying this service 
      data.</p>
      <p>The Index Service uses an extensible framework for managing static and 
      dynamic data for Grids built using GT3.&nbsp; Note that the Index Service does 
      not beget specific data types.&nbsp; The types of data available from the Index 
      Service for queries and other operations instead depend on how the service 
      is configured; that is, what sorts of Service Data Providers it uses to 
      aggregate data and what sorts of other services it indexes. </p>
<p>&quot;Information service, implemented as the Index Service, is one of the
  GT3.2 Base Services. It collects, aggregates, and queries Service Data; monitors
  data  feeds; and creates Service Data dynamically on demand. It can be used
  to index  Service Data carrying state information from multiple grid service
  instances for  use in resource discovery, selection and optimization.&quot; - IBM</p>
<h3>What the Index Service Is</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The 
    Index Service is an information service that uses an extensible framework for managing static and dynamic data 
    for Grids built using the Globus Toolkit 3.2. This framework provides the following functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creates and manages dynamic Service Data via <b>Service Data Provider programs</b> </li>
    <li> Aggregates Service Data from multiple 
	      Grid service instances </li>
    <li> Registers Grid service instances using the ServiceGroup port type</li>
  </ul>
