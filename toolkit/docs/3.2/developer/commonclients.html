<h1>Globus Toolkit 3.2: Developer's Guide </h1>
<p>This page contains information about common clients that are used in many
  components of the Globus Toolkit 3.2. This page is still under construction,
  so check back often for more information:

<h1>Setting your environment </h1>
<p>You need to set your environment before using any Globus Toolkit Version
  3.2 (GT3.2) command.&nbsp; You need to do this
  on both the client and server machines.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to
  the location of your GT3.2 installation.&nbsp; For Unix, this would look like
  the following example: </p>
<p class="command">export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/gt3 </p>
<p>For Windows, this would look like the following example: </p>
<p class="command">set GLOBUS_LOCATION c:\gt3 </p>
<p>There are two environment scripts, called GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
  and GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh.&nbsp; Enter the one that corresponds
  to the type of shell you are using. </p>
<p>For example, in csh or tcsh, you enter: </p>
<p class="command">source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh
</p>
<p>In sh, bash, ksh, or zsh, you enter: </p>
<p class="command">. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
</p>
<h2>globus-url-copy 
</h2>
<p>This client is a basic URL-to-URL copy. </p>
<p>The basic syntax for <code>globus-url-copy</code> is: </p>
<p class="command">$ globus-url-copy sourceURL destURL
</p>
<p>If <code>&lt;sourceURL&gt;</code> is a directory, all files within that
    directory will be copied. <code>&lt;destURL&gt;</code> must be a directory
    if multiple files are being copied. Any url specifying a directory must end
  with <code>/</code> </p>
<p>The URL prefix for GridFTP is <code>gsiftp://</code>. It can also handle <code>file://</code>, <code>http://</code>,
  and <code>https://</code>. </p>
<p>By default, <code>globus-url-copy</code> is expecting the same kind of host
  certificates that <code>globusrun</code> expects from gatekeepers. </p>
<p><strong>If you run a GridFTP server by hand</strong>, you will need to explicitly
    specify the subject name to expect.&nbsp; You can use the <code>-ss</code> flag
    to set the sourceURL subject, and <code>-ds</code> to set the destURL subject.&nbsp; If
    you use <code>-s</code> alone,
    it will set both to be the same.&nbsp; You can see an example of this usage
    under the Verification section of this guide.&nbsp; <strong>Please note: </strong> This
    is the <strong>unusual </strong> case of using this client.&nbsp; Most times
you only need to specify both URLs. </p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/cog/distribution/1.1/api/org/globus/tools/GlobusUrlCopy.html">API</a> for more information. </p>
  <h2>grid-proxy-init</h2>

Proxies are certificates signed by the user, or by another proxy, that do
  not require a password to submit a job. They are intended for short-term
  use, when the user is submitting many jobs and cannot be troubled to repeat
  his password for every job. The subject of a proxy certificate is the same
  as the subject of the certificate that signed it, with /CN=proxy added to
  the name. The gatekeeper will accept any job requests submitted by the user,
as well as any proxies he has created. 
  <p>Proxies provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering passwords,
    but are also less secure than the user's normal security credential. Therefore,
    they should always be user-readable only, and should be deleted after they
    are no longer needed (or after they expire).
<p>The basic syntax for <code>grid-proxy-init</code> is:
<ul class="command">
  % grid-proxy-init
</ul>
<p>This command creates a proxy with the default expiration of 12 hours.   
<p>The <code>grid-proxy-init</code> program can also take arguments to specify the expiration
    and proxy key length. For example:
<ul class="command">
  % grid-proxy-init -hours 8 -bits 512
</ul>
<p>To delete a proxy that was previously created with <code>grid-proxy-init</code>, run:
<ul class="command">
  % grid-proxy-destroy
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
