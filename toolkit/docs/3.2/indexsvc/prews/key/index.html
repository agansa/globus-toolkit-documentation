<h2><a name="ISandGT">The 
Index Service and the Globus Toolkit</a></h2>
<p>This section continues our <a href="../../../key/index.html">overview of the 
Globus Toolkit and grid computing</a>. (toolkit concepts)</p>
      <p>Each <b>Grid service instance</b> has a particular set of service data associated 
      with it.&nbsp; The essence of the Index Service is to provide an interface for 
      operations accessing, aggregating, generating, and querying this service 
      data.</p>
      <p>The Index Service uses an extensible framework for managing static and 
      dynamic data for Grids built using GT3.&nbsp; Note that the Index Service does 
      not beget specific data types.&nbsp; The types of data available from the Index 
      Service for queries and other operations instead depend on how the service 
      is configured; that is, what sorts of Service Data Providers it uses to 
      aggregate data and what sorts of other services it indexes. </p>
<p>&quot;Information service, implemented as the Index Service, is one of the GT3 
Base Services. It collects, aggregates, and queries Service Data; monitors data 
feeds; and creates Service Data dynamically on demand. It can be used to index 
Service Data carrying state information from multiple grid service instances for 
use in resource discovery, selection and optimization.&quot; IBM</p>
<h3>What the Index Service Does</h3>
<p>The 
Index Service uses an extensible framework for managing static and dynamic data 
for Grids built using the Globus Toolkit 3.2. This framework provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creates and manages dynamic Service Data via <b>Service Data Provider programs</b> </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">
	Aggregates Service Data from multiple 
	Grid service instances </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">
	Registers Grid service instances.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">What the Index Services Is 
Not</h3>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">The Index Service is not a 
message-queuing service.</p>
<h2><a name="ISuses">
Uses/Benefits of the Index Service</a></h2>
<p>The Index Service provides the following key 
capabilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An interface for connecting <b>external 
	Service Data Provider programs</b> to service instances</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Index Service provides a standard 
	mechanism for <b>dynamic generation of service data via external programs</b>.&nbsp; 
	These external provider programs can be the [core providers] that are part of 
	GT3 or user-created, custom providers. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">
	A generic framework for aggregation of service 
	data </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>Service data coming 
        in from multiple Service Data Provider programs and other Grid services 
        can be aggregated in different ways and indexed to provide efficient 
        query processing.&nbsp; Various command-line tools and GUIs can be used as 
        clients to the aggregate data views.&nbsp; The Index Service uses standard OGSA notification mechanisms for subscription, notification, and 
        updating of service data.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>A Registry of Grid services </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>A set of available 
        Grid services is maintained in a Registry.&nbsp; A Registry allows for 
        soft-state registration of Grid services, in that a set of services can 
        be registered and periodically updated as required.&nbsp; A Registry  can then be used to support query or other operations on a given service.&nbsp; A 
        Registry is also known as a Service Group.</p></blockquote>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>A 
		dynamic data-generating and indexing node</li>
	</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Index Service combines ServiceDataProviderExecution 
	components with&nbsp;&nbsp;ServiceDataAggregator and ServiceGroup 
	components to create a dynamic data-generating and&nbsp;indexing node, similar in 
	concept to an MDS2 hierarchical GIIS. </p> </blockquote>

<h2><a name="ISinfomodel">
Index Service Information Model</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, each Grid service instance 
has a particular set of service data associated with it [should that info be 
here instead?].&nbsp; The essence of the 
Index Service is to provide an interface for operations accessing, aggregating, 
generating, and querying this data.</p>
<p>This section presents a brief overview of OGSA 
and Globus Toolkit 3.0 concepts and terminology<b> as related to the Index 
Service</b>.&nbsp; More information on OGSA and GT3 can be found [in the publications 
listed in the <i>
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" href="#RelatedDocuments">
Related Documents</a></i> section].</p>
<p>The OGSA model comprises persistent services 
(typically a few) and transient services (potentially many).&nbsp; All services 
adhere to specified Grid service interfaces and behaviors.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The interfaces 
correspond to WSDL portTypes and are used for managing the Grid service 
instances.&nbsp; The <i>GridService</i> portType is used to query and update the 
service data of a Grid Service instance and control the lifetime of the 
instance.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Grid services</b> - persistent and transient</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; all services adhere to Grid service <b>interfaces</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; interfaces correspond to <b>WSDL 
portTypes</b> which manage Grid service instances(?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; <b> <i>
GridService</i> portType</b> queries and updates the service data of a Grid service 
instance and controls the lifetime of the instance</p>
<p>The interfaces and functions most relevant to 
the Index Service can be summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Factory </h3>
<p>Used to create a new Grid service instance 
	via its <b>CreateService</b> operation.&nbsp; A Factory returns a Grid 
Service Handle (GSH) as described below, and maintains a set of Service Data Elements that 
	can be queried.</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Grid Service Handle (GSH)
</h3>
<p>Returned by the Factory CreateService operation.&nbsp; 
	A GSH is a URL used to globally name a Grid service instance for all time.&nbsp; 
	In order to use the service, a GSH must be converted to a Grid Service Reference 
(GSR) as described below .&nbsp; </p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Grid Service Reference (GSR)
</h3>
<p>Describes how a client can communicate with 
	a Grid service instance.&nbsp; The <b>HandleMap</b> interface allows a client to map 
	from a GSH to a GSR [is that the same as converting (above)?].&nbsp; While the GSH represents 
only the name, the GSR includes 
	binding information for transport protocol and data encoding format.</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Query </h3>
<p>Provides extensible query language 
	support via the <b>FindServiceData</b> operation from the GridService interface.&nbsp; This is a standard, extensible query operation 
	against a service’s [Service Data Elements], which may use either the simple 
	default “by name” query or a more complex language like XPath or XQuery.&nbsp; 
	The client to the query interface is the <code>ogsi-find-service-data</code> 
	command (see <i>
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/releases/final/docs/infosvcs/querysvcdata.html">Querying Service Data</a></i>).</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Registry  </h3>
<p>Supports discovery by returning the GSHs of 
	a set of Grid services.&nbsp; A Registry allows for soft-state registration of 
	Grid services, in that a set of Grid services can periodically register 
	their GSHs into a Registry service to allow for discovery of services in 
	that set.</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Notification </h3>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">Also known as subscription.</p>
<p>The <b>NotificationSource</b> interface is used for client subscription (to register interest in a service) 
and sends 
	notification messages about registered topics.&nbsp;These topics can be linked 
	to arbitrary values (<b>state</b> values) generated by a service at runtime or 
	linked to a Service Data Element.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <b>NotificationSink</b> interface is used 
	for asynchronous delivery of notification messages; it can be applied to 
	dynamic discovery/registration services, monitoring, application error 
	notification, etc.</p>
<p>To summarize, a Grid service instance is 
created by the Factory interface, which returns a GSH to identify the service.&nbsp; 
The GSH is converted to a GSR (which includes binding information) so that the 
service can be used.&nbsp; Service instances can be identified in a Registry, which 
can be used to support query or other operations on a given service.&nbsp; The 
Notification interface provides for subscription to and delivery of notification 
messages regarding service-related events.</p>
<h2><a name="Queries">Queries</a></h2>
<p>Data discovery often requires 
instance-specific, sometimes dynamic information.&nbsp; So far in this document, 
we’ve seen that each Grid service instance has a particular set of service data 
associated with it.&nbsp; This service data offers a general solution to the issues 
of discovery, in that every service must support some common service data, and 
may support any additional service data desired, such as metadata and instance 
state data. [repetitive]</p>
<p>A primary function of 
the Index Service is to provide an interface for querying aggregate views of 
service data collected from other services.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both Notification and FindServiceData are forms 
of query against the service data of an instance.&nbsp; FindServiceData is a simple 
synchronous query (<b>pull</b>), while a subscription notification is a persistent 
query, with asynchronous response (<b>push</b>).</p>
<h2><a name="UserInterface">
User Interfacee</a></h2>
<p>In GT3, there are presently two ways in which 
you can access the service data aggregated by the Index Service:&nbsp; the GT3 
Service Data Browser and the <code>
ogsi-find-service-data</code> 
command.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GT3 Service Data Browser</h2>
<p>The Service Data Browser is the GUI to service data within GT3.&nbsp; The 
Browser allows you to view the details of the Grid services available to you 
from a Registry configured by your administrator.&nbsp; These services include, 
but are not limited to, the Index Service.&nbsp; Service data can be viewed in 
various formats, depending on your requirements.&nbsp; See <i>
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/releases/final/docs/infosvcs/sdbquickstart.html">
GT3 Service Data Browser Quick Start</a></i> 
for details on and examples of using the Browser.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ogsi-find-service-data 
Command</h3>
<p>The <kbd>ogsi-find-service-data</kbd>
command provides a command-line interface for querying the service data 
available to you from the Index Service or any Grid service.</p>
<p>The <kbd>ogsi-find-service-data</kbd> 
command allows you to perform queries:</p>
<ul>
	<li>by specifying a Grid service and one or 
	more Service Data Element names. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in">
	by specifying an XPath expression in addition 
	to the above. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify the <kbd>ogsi-find-service-data</kbd> 
command output as raw XML or as an easy-to-read outline format. </p>

<h2><a name="Security">
Security</a></h2>
<p>The security mechanism used by the Globus 
Toolkit is the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), which enables the use of 
certificates and various files to provide authentication and authorization 
services.&nbsp; GSI is described in more detail in <i>
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.globus.org/security">
GSI Security Infrastructure</a></i>. </p>
<p>GSI is a library for providing generic security 
services for applications that will be run on the Grid.&nbsp; </p>
<p>GSI provides programs 
to facilitate login to a variety of sites, while each site has its own flavor of 
security measures. </p>
<p>GSI provides a single sign-on authentication 
service, to identify a user for access to multiple Grid resources via one 
sign-on procedure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>GSI also provides local control over access rights and 
mapping from global to local user identities.</p>
<p>OGSA provides two different GSI 
implementations.&nbsp; One is based on message-level security, and the other on 
transport-level security, as known from Version 2 of the Globus Toolkit (GT2).&nbsp; 
We support <b>transport-level security </b>in order to be backwards compatible with 
GT2, and also to simplify integration with hosting environments that do not use 
message-level security support.&nbsp; </p>
<p>GSI defines protocols for mutual 
authentication, credential delegation, proxy signing, message protection, and 
authorization, and typically sits on top of a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport 
Layer Security (SSL/TLS) implementation.</p>
