<p>Data discovery often requires instance-specific, sometimes dynamic information.&nbsp; So
  far in this document, we've seen that each Grid service instance has a particular
  set of service data associated with it.&nbsp; This service data offers a general
  solution to the issues of discovery, in that every service must support some
  common service data, and may support any additional service data desired, such
as metadata and instance state data. </p>
<h3>FindServiceData</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A primary function of the Index Service is to provide an interface for querying
    aggregate views of service data collected from other services.&nbsp; The FindServiceData
    operation from the GridService interface is used to query this information.&nbsp; This
    is a standard, extensible query operation against a service's Service Data
    Elements, which may use either the simple default “by name” query or a more
    complex language like XPath or XQuery.&nbsp; The ogsi-find-service-data command
    (see <em><a href="http://www.globus.org/ogsa/releases/final/docs/infosvcs/querysvcdata.html">Querying
    Service Data </a></em>) is the client to the query interface. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>NotificationSource</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The NotificationSource interface is used for client subscription, to register
    interest in a service.&nbsp; It sends notification messages about registered
    topics.&nbsp; These topics can be linked to arbitrary values (state values)
    generated by a service at runtime or linked to a Service Data Element.&nbsp; The
    NotificationSink interface is used for asynchronous delivery of notification
    messages; it can be applied to dynamic discovery/registration services, monitoring,
    application error notification, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pull/Push (synchronous/asynchronous) </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Both subscription and FindServiceData are forms of query against the service
        data of an instance.&nbsp; FindServiceData is a simple synchronous query
        (pull), while a subscription notification is a persistent query, with
        asynchronous response (push). </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Registry</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Registry interface supports discovery by returning the GSHs of a set
    of Grid services.&nbsp; The Registry allows for soft-state registration of
    Grid services, in that a set of Grid services can periodically register their
        GSHs into a Registry service, to allow for discovery of services in that
        set. </p>
