<h2>Acquiring certificates </h2>
<p>In order for authentication to work within Globus and GSI-enabled tools, all
  users and services need to have a certificate issued from a trusted certificate
authority (CA). </p>
<p>Because the CA is the heart of the Globus/GSI authentication system, it is
  highly recommended that the builders of production Grids either establish their
  own trusted CA or use an established commercial CA.

<p>You must have X509 certificates to use the GT 3.2 software securely (referred
  to in this documentation as <span class="emphasis"><i>host certificates</i></span>).  </p>
<p>Host certificates must be:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>consist of the following two files: <tt>hostcert.pem</tt> and <tt>hostkey.pem</tt></li>
  <li>must be in the appropriate directory for secure services: <tt>/etc/grid-security/</tt> </li>
  <li>must be for a machine which has a consistent name in DNS; you should <span class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> run
      it on a computer using DHCP where a different name could be assigned to
    your computer.</li>
</ul>
  <p>You have the following options: <a href="#s-basic-existing">request a certificate
      from an existing CA</a>,
    <a href="#s-basic-simpleca">use SimpleCA</a>, or <a href="#s-basic-gcs">use
    a low-trust certificate</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="s-basic-existing"></a>Request a certificate
  from an existing CA</h3>
  <p>Your best option is to use an already existing CA. You may have access to
      one from the company you work for, or an organization you are affiliated
      with. Some universities provide certificates for their members and affiliates.
      Contact your support organization for details about how to acquire a certificate.
      You may find your CA listed in the <a href="http://www.terena.nl/tech/task-forces/tf-aace/tacar/certs.html" target="_top">TERENA
  Repository</a>. </p>
<p>If you already have a CA, you will need to follow their configuration directions.
      If they include a CA setup package, follow the CAs instruction on how to
      install the setup package. If they do not, you will need to create an <tt>/etc/grid-security/certificates</tt> directory
      and include the CA cert and signing policy in that directory. See <a href="http://www-fp.globus.org/security/config.html#Configuring%20a%20Trusted%20CA" target="_top">Configuring
  a Trusted CA</a> for more details. </p>
<p>This type of certificate is best for service deployment and Grid inter-operation. </p>
<h3><a name="s-basic-simpleca"></a>SimpleCA</h3>
  <p>SimpleCA provides a wrapper around the OpenSSL CA functionality and is sufficient
      for simple Grid services. Alternatively, you can use OpenSSL's <b>CA.sh</b> command
      on its own. Instructions on how to use the SimpleCA can be found <a href="../../installation/install_config.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>SimpleCA is suitable for testing or when a certificate authority is not
available.</p>
<h3><a name="s-basic-gcs"></a>Low-trust certificate</h3>
  <p>Globus offers a low-trust certificate available at <a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs" target="_top">http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs</a>.
      This option should only be used as a last resort because it does not fulfill
some of the duties of a real Certificate Authority. </p>
<p>This type of certificate is best suited for short term testing. </p>
