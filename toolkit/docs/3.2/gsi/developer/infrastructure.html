        Toolkit Grid Resource Acquisition and Management (GRAM) service with a
        strong eye towards the<strong> least privilege principle</strong>. No
        services in GT3 need any elevated privileges ("root" access). All privileged
        code is contained in two small setuid-root programs with tightly constrained
    functionality. <em></em></p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p><em>Use of Web Services Security Specifications</em></p>
      <p>GSI3 has protocols
          for authentication and message protection using Web Services specifications
          for securing messages using SOAP ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">XML-Signature </a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Encryption/">XML-Encryption </a>)

      <p>GSI3 uses technologies that are defined
        in either existing or proposed standards in the IETF, GGF, W3C or Oasis.      </p>
      <p>GSI3 will continue to be based on only public standards. <br>

      <p>The GT3 GSI libraries support Proxy
        Certificates as specified in the <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/standards/#proxy">latest
      IETF/Global Grid Forum draft</a>. </p>
      <p>This includes support for both impersonation
          and independent proxy certificates and a framework that allows for
      addition of supporting other delegation policies. </p>
      <p>The GT3 GSI libraries
          are also backwards compatible with GT2 proxies, in that they will accept
    GT2 proxies and treat them as GT3 impersonation proxies. </p></td>
    <td>GT 3.x, backwards compatible with GT2.x proxies </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><em>Enhanced client-side authorization</em></p>
      <p>Services in GT3 have credentials
          that not only indicate the resource name on which they are running,
      but the account in which they are running. </p>
      <p>This allows clients connecting
          to these services a greater level of assurance that they are interacting
    with an appropriate service. </p></td>

<h3> <a name="proxypolicy"></a>Proxy Policy Handling </h3>
<p>To determine the identity returned from the GSI libraries, the proxy certificate
  chain is walked from PC to EEC (i.e., "first certificate" is the proxy certificate
not CA certificate): </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Identity of first certificate that is either not
      a proxy or whose policy is not 'impersonation' or 'gt2-limited impersonation,
      the identity of that proxy is the identity returned by GSI.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Any occurrences of 'gt2-limited impersonation' in
    chain before certificate with returned identity. If any of these policies
    occur, mark proxy as limited. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p>Given the following chain, the identity returned should be the identity
      of the <em>EEC</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Impersonation) -&gt; Proxy 2 (Impersonation) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the following chain, the identity returned should be the identity of
  <em>proxy #2</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Impersonation) -&gt; Proxy 2 (Independent)
    -&gt; Proxy 3 (Impersonation) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the following chain, the identity returned should be the identity of
  <em>proxy #1</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>CA cert -&gt; EEC -&gt; Proxy 1 (Unrecognized policy) -&gt; Proxy 2 (Impersonation) </p>
</blockquote>
