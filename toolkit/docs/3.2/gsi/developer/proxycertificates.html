<h2>Using proxy certificates </h2>
<p>Proxies are certificates signed by the user, or by another proxy, that do
  not require a password to submit&nbsp;a job.&nbsp; They are intended for short-term
  use, when the user is submitting many jobs and cannot be troubled to repeat
  his password for every job.&nbsp; The subject of a proxy certificate is the
  same as the subject of the certificate that signed it, with <strong>/CN=proxy </strong>added
  to the name.&nbsp; The gatekeeper will accept any job requests submitted by
the user, as well as any proxies he has created.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Proxies provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering passwords,
  but are also less secure than the user's normal security credential.&nbsp; Therefore,
  they should <strong>always</strong> be user-readable only, and should be deleted
  after they are no longer needed (or after they expire.)</p>
<p>To create a proxy with the default expiration (12 hours), run the grid-proxy-init
  program.&nbsp; For example: </p>
<pre class="command" align="left">% grid-proxy-init </pre>
<p>The grid-proxy-init program can also take arguments to specify the expiration
  and proxy key length.&nbsp; For example: </p>
<pre class="command" align="left">% grid-proxy-init -hours 8 -bits 512 </pre>
<p>To delete a proxy that was previously created with grid-proxy-init, run: </p>
<pre class="command" align="left">% grid-proxy-destroy </pre>
