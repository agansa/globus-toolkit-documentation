<h3><a name="Configuration for Generating Certificate Requests">Configuration
      for Generating Certificate Requests </a></h3>
The following files are required for generating a certificate request:
<ul>
  <li>globus-user-ssl.conf.XXXXX : defines the distinguished name to use for
    a user's certificate request.
  <li>globus-host-ssl.conf.XXXXX : defines the distinguished name for a host
      (or service) certificate request.
  <li>grid-security.conf.XXXXXX : a base configuration file used by the above
      configuration files. </li>
</ul>
XXXXX is replaced by the unique hash of the trusted CA certificate (The CA which
will sign the request). These files should be located in the <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong> directory,
explained in the following section. To generate a certificate request, grid-cert-request
must be able to determine which trusted CA (multiple CA's may be installed) to
generate a request for. This is done by creating a symbolic link for each of
these config files from the <strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong> directory, to their
actual location in the <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong> directory. <br>
<br>
<strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong>/globus-user-ssl.conf --&gt; <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong>/globus-user-ssl.conf.XXXXXX <br>
<strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong>/globus-user-ssl.conf --&gt; <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong>/globus-host-ssl.conf.XXXXXX <br>
<strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong>/globus-user-ssl.conf --&gt; <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong>/grid-security.conf.XXXXXX <br>
<br>
<br>
These files are only required when you plan to use the grid-cert-request tool.
<h3><a name="Configuring a Trusted CA">Configuring a Trusted CA </a></h3>
The following files are required to setup a trusted CA (required by all globus
enabled programs):
<ul>
  <li>XXXXX.0 : The trusted CA certificate.
  <li>XXXXX.signing_policy : A configuration file defining the DN's a CA is
      willing to sign. </li>
</ul>
XXXXX is replaced by the hash of the trusted CA certificate. These files need
to be located in the <strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong> directory, explained in the
following section.
<h3><a name="GSI Directories">GSI Directories </a></h3>
<p>The GSI uses the following directories:
<ul>
  <li><strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong> directory: contains the CA certificates and
    associated files trusted by the globus installation . The trusted certificates
    directory is searched for in the following order: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>X509_CERT_DIR environment variable. If this variable is set, trusted
            certificates are searched for here.
          <li>$HOME/.globus/certificates/ This is a user specific location
              to search for trusted certificates.
          <li>/etc/grid-security/certificates/ The default location for trusted
              certificates and config files. This location is independent of
              the location of a globus installation.
          <li>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certificates/ location based on a globus
              installation. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    Be aware, the first directory found to exist in the search order is the directory
    that gets used, independ e nt of whether it has the correct trusted CA certificate.
    If multiple directories exist and you want to use a directory that does not
    appear first in the search order, X509_CERT_DIR must be set. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong> directory: contains symbolic links to the
    certificate request configuration files . For certificate request purposes
    t his directory is searched for in the following order: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>GRID_SECURITY_DIR environment variable. If this variable is set,
            the symbolic links of configuration files are searched for here.
          <li>/etc/grid-security The default location to search for the configuration
              file symbolic links.
          <li>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc File location based on a globus install. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    If a certificate request needs to be based on an installed trusted CA other
    than the default, grid-cert-request provides the -ca to specify any CA to
    create a request. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><a name="Installation of GSI Configuration Files">Installation of
      GSI Configuration Files </a></strong></h3>
The above configuration files are installed using the setup-gsi script. This
script gets run as a manual post-install step to an installation of the globus
toolkit. Using the option -nonroot will install configuration files as follows: <br>
<br>
<strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong>: $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certificates <br>
<strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong>: $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ <br>
<br>
If the -nonroot option is <strong>not </strong> used, the configuration files
will be installed as follows: <br>
<br>
<strong>TRUSTED_CA </strong>: /etc/grid-security/certificates <br>
<strong>GRID_SECURITY </strong>: /etc/grid-security <br>
<h3><strong><a name="Gridmap File Search Rules">Gridmap File Search </a></strong><strong> Rules </strong></h3>
<p>The Gridmap file is searched for in the following way. If the user is root
  (uid 0) then the following locations are checked: </p>
<ul>
  <li> value of the GRIDMAP environment variable
  <li>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile </li>
</ul>
<p>If on the other hand the user is a non-root user we check the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> value of the GRIDMAP environment variable
  <li>$HOME/.gridmap </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Credential Acquisition Rules">Credential Acquisition Rules </a></h3>
<p>Credentials are looked for in the following order: service credential, host
  credential, proxy credential and user credential. These are in turn looked
  for in the following locations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Service credentials:
      <ul>
        <li>the X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT environment variables
        <li>/etc/grid-security/ &lt;service&gt;/&lt;service&gt;{cert,key}.pem
        <li>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ &lt;service&gt;/&lt;service&gt;{cert,key}.pem
        <li>$HOME/.globus / &lt;service&gt;/&lt;service&gt;{cert,key}.pem </li>
      </ul>
  <li>Host credentials:
      <ul>
        <li>the X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT environment variables
        <li>/etc/grid-security/ host{cert,key}.pem
        <li>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/host {cert,key}.pem
        <li>$HOME/.globus / host{cert,key}.pem </li>
      </ul>
  <li>Proxy credentials:
      <ul>
        <li>the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable
        <li>/tmp/x509up_u&lt;uid&gt; </li>
      </ul>
  <li>User credentials:
      <ul>
        <li>the X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT environment variables
        <li>$HOME/.globus/user{cert,key}.pem
        <li>$HOME/.globus/usercred.p12 </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
