  &gt;Using grid-proxy-init </p>
<h2>Using grid-proxy-init
</h2>
<p>This client creates a proxy  with the default expiration of 12 hours. </p>
  <p>Proxies are certificates signed by the user, or by another proxy, that do
    not require a password to submit a job. They are intended for short-term
    use, when the user is submitting many jobs and cannot be troubled to repeat
  his password for every job. </p>
  <p>The subject of a proxy certificate is the same
      as the subject of the certificate that signed it, with<strong> /CN=proxy</strong> added
    to the name. The gatekeeper will accept any job requests submitted by the
    user, as well as any proxies he has created. </p>
  <p>Proxies provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering passwords,
      but are also less secure than the user's normal security credential. Therefore,
      they should always be <strong>user-readable only</strong>, and should be deleted after they
      are no longer needed (or after they expire).

  <h3><a name="syntax"></a>Syntax</h3>
  <p>The basic syntax is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre class="command">% grid-proxy-init [optional command line switches]</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="commandlineoptions"></a>Command line options </h3>
  <p>The <code>grid-proxy-init</code> program can also take arguments to specify the expiration
  and proxy key length. </p>
  <table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td width="69" valign="top"><pre>-hours</pre></td>
      <td width="549" valign="top"><p>Specifies the expiration of the proxy certificate</p>
      <p>The default is 12 hours. </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><pre>-bits</pre></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed
          for the proxy key. </p>
      <p>The default is ??. </p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>For example: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre class="command">% grid-proxy-init -hours 8 -bits 512</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="deletingproxy"></a>Deleting a proxy </h3>
  <p>To delete a proxy that was previously created with <code>grid-proxy-init</code>, run:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre class="command">% grid-proxy-destroy</pre>
    <?php include("http://www-unix.globus.org/include/globus_footer.inc"); ?>
</blockquote>
