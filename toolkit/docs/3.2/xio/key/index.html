  <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
  <p>Globus XIO is an extensible input/output library for the Globus Toolkit
    (tm) that provides a simple and intuitive API (open/close/read/write)
    to swappable IO implementations.</p>
  <p>Globus XIO has 2 main goals: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide a single user API to all Grid IO Protocols. </strong><br>
        <br>
    In Distributed programming there are many protocols used for message passing.
    There are typically many different APIs for using all the different protocols,
    despite the fact that they have the same end goal, moving bytes from end
    point to end point. Application developers are forced to code straight to
    a protocols API. Therefore if they ever want to change the underlying protocol
    they originally selected, then they have to change the applications source
    code to utilize an entirely new API. Even subtle differences in the API can
    become a difficult task. This adds to the already complicated task
    of keeping up with the technology curve. <br>
    <br>
    Globus XIO provides a <strong>single</strong> API to <strong>any</strong>    wire
    protocol. The API has a very common look and feel making it very intuitive
    to use. As new protocols are developed they can be added to Globus XIO in
    the form of "drivers". A driver is completely hidden behind Globus XIO so
    when new ones are used, they are transparent to the application developer.
    Therefore an application programmer can code to the globus_xio user API once
    and then focus on the applications needs throughout its life cycle. If 
    in a few years down the line they want the same application to work with
    the latest and greatest protocol for shipping bytes around the Grid, <strong>they
    do not have to change a line of source code</strong>. <br>
        <br>
    <li><strong>Minimize the development time for creating/prototyping new protocols. </strong><br>
        <br>
    In grid computing research is done into how to push bytes faster and faster
    around the grid. Proof of concept is an important part of this research.
    A problem that often comes up is the time it takes to both design and implement
    new protocols. <br>
        <br>
    Globus XIO addressed these issues. Globus XIO provides a driver development
    interface that allows a developer to concentrate on writing code to implement
    the protocol. It takes the headache of error checking, asynchronous message
    delivery, timeouts and other important issues out of the protocol implementors
    path. <br>
        <br>
    Also it allows for a maximum reuse of code with the notion of a driver stack.
    Each driver should be one atomic unit that can be mixed and matched with
    other drivers. For example: GSI security can be written once as a driver
    then stacked on top of TCP, NETBLT UDP blast, or any other transport protocol.
    This makes it much easier to develop the transport protocols, since the only
    focus on the developer are the details of the protocol they are creating. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="features"></a>Features</h2>
  <p> Globus XIO is a feature-rich runtime system. One of its two main goals
    is to provide the application developer with a simple, easy-to-use API. Part
    of meeting this goal is providing  all the built-in features they need.
    A library is hardly easy to use if its users have to write most of the needed
    functionality themselves. <br>
 <br>
 Globus XIO features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple API </strong><br>
        <br>
    Globus XIO provides a simple API for all  basic functionality. To find
    Globus XIO useful, you only need to be familiar with open, close read
    and write. <br>
    <li><strong>Extensibility with drivers </strong><br>
        <br>
    Globus XIO is designed to be extended. The library provides hooks to add
    future protocols. <br>
    <li><strong>Efficiency </strong><br>
        <br>
    Globus XIO is designed efficiency. If you only
    need a highly optimized, efficient IO library, then Globus XIO is a
    good choice.<br>
    <li><strong>Timeouts </strong><br>
        <br>
    IO timeouts are built into the library so the user does <strong>not</strong> have
    to set their own alarms to determine if an IO operation is taking too long.
    With <code>globus_xio</code>, they simply set a <strong>timeout
    value</strong> and they will
    be notified when/if an operation has not progressed for the specified amount
    of time. <br>
    <li><strong>Data Descriptors </strong><br>
        <br>
    Along with a buffer to be written or read, Globus XIO allows the user to
    pass  metadata describing the buffer. Also, after an IO operation has
    completed, Globus XIO returns a data descriptor to the user. This allows
    for some interesting extensions. In the future we hope to make it possible
    for a user to read from the protocol stack and pass the buffer and data descriptor
    received to a write on a completely different protocol stack and have things
    automatically massaged and negotiated for compatibility. </li>
  </ul>
