are represented by a white background. </p>

<p>The core component of the Globus Toolkit version 3 contains the basic infrastructure
  needed for building grid services. In particular, it is comprised of the following
  major subcomponents:</p>
<table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th>OGSI Spec Implementation </th>
    <td colspan="2">An implementation of the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/draft-ggf-ogsi-gridservice-33_2003-06-27.pdf" target="_blank">OGSI
    Specification </a>, i.e., an implementation of all OGSI specified interfaces. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Security Infrastructure</th>
    <td colspan="2">This subcomponent provides support for message level security, authentication
      and gridmap based authorization. The message level security implementation
      provides session (GSI-SecureConversation) as well as per-message (GSI-SecureMessage)
    based security. More information can be found <a href="http://www-fp.globus.org/security/GSI3/index.html" target="_blank">here </a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>System level services</th>
    <td colspan="2">System level services are OGSI-compliant grid services that
      are generic enough to be used by all other grid services. Currently the
      toolkit contains three system level services:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>Ping service</th>
    <td>Used to "ping" a hosting environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>Logging Management Service</th>
    <td>Allows you to modify log filters and to group existing log producers
    into more easily manageable units at run time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>Management Service</th>
    <td>Provides an interface for monitoring the current status and load of a
      grid service container and to
            cleanly shut down a container. It also allows you to activate and
    deactivate service instances.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Note:</strong> The Admin Service (which formerly
      contained the ping and shutdown services) was deprecated in GT 3.2. </td>

<h2><a name="interdependence"></a>Interdependence with other components </h2>
<p>GT3.2 Core itself depends on and is required by a number of other components. <br>
  <br>
The components GT3.2 Core depends on are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A hosting environment that provides traditional web server functionality,
    such as a transport mechanism, e.g. HTTP. <br>
    <br>
    GT3.2 ships with lightweight embedded
    and standalone hosting environments, but will also work with a standard Java
    Servlet Engine, e.g. Tomcat, and EJB application servers, e.g. JBOSS or Websphere.
    <br>  
  <li>A web service engine which is responsible for implementing XML Messaging.
      <br>
      <br>
    GT3.2 currently depends on the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/" target="_blank">Apache
      Axis </a>project for this component. </li>
</ul>
Components that require GT3.2 Core are:
<ul>
  <li>The base service component which contains the higher level services such
    as the <a href="../../gram/ws/index.html">WS GRAM </a>(program
    execution) and <a href="../../rft/index.html">Reliable
    File Transfer </a>services that ship with GT3.2.<br>
  <li>User-defined services. This term denotes services outside of the toolkit
      that are developed on top of any subset of GT3.2 components ,including
    the base services. </li>
</ul>
