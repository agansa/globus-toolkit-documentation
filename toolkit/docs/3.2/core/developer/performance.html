<h3><a name="startup">Startup and Initialization</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of initialization operations that can slow down the first
  invocation on a service. The container activates all its services on first
  use, unless they are explicitly configured to be activated on startup. The
  first activation of a service in a JVM is going to be slow since typically
  a whole set of jars need to be loaded into memory at that point. The same goes
  for the a client application and its first use of a client stub. When factories
  are activated, meta data configured for the services are dynamically loaded
  into memory.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To decrease the startup time of a service container you can start it up using
  the -lazy argument. This will suppress the default behavior of querying the
container for all its registered services. </p>
<h3><a name="memory">Memory Usage</a></h3>
<p>A service takes up something in the order of 40kB in active state. In order
  to minimize the footprint of the server you can configure your services to
  be deactivated when not used. The service will be deactivated after a configurable
  TTL value (in seconds) specified in the deployment descriptor of the factory
  like below: </p>
<pre class="command">&lt;parameter name="lifecycleMonitorClass" value="org.globus.ogsa.repository.DefaultServiceDeactivator"/&gt; 
&lt;parameter name="instanceDeactivation" value="10000"/&gt; </pre>
<p>Note that even if you deactivate a service some meta data will be available
  in order to be able to quickly activate the service again. If you don't want
  the container to keep any meta data at all for deactivated services you need
  to use a ServiceLoader that minimally needs to recover the handle and the timeout
  of a service. Look at the samples/counter/deactivation/CounterFactoryService
  service for an example. Note that the ServiceLoader implementation is only
used for demo purposes, so you would need to plug in your own ServiceLoader. </p>
<h3><a name="invocation">Invocation Overhead</a></h3>
<p>On an IBM ThinkPad T22, Pentium II, running Windows 2000 we have seen basic
  local machine roundtrip invocation overhead in the order of 5-10ms, and for
  basic service creation calls the overhead is around 25-30ms. Activation of
  a factory service takes about 130-140ms. Note these numbers should only be
  used as ballpark figures when profiling your services built on top of the framework. </p>
<h3><a name="profiling">Service Container Profiling</a></h3>
<p>For programmatic ways to instrument your services look at the <a href="javaprogramming.html">Java
    Programming</a> section.&nbsp; To run an hprof instrumented service container
    with Suns JDK you can do as follows: </p>
<p>From the root of the distribution run ant -f build-services.xml profileContainer.
  Now you can run clients against the container that exercise the service you
  want to profile. </p>
<p>When you are done with profiling you can stop the container using ant stopContainer.
  On exit a profile log will be dumped into profile.txt. Note that the container
  will run much slower when instrumented. </p>
<p>If you have a source distribution you can test the performance on your machine
  using the ant tasks: stressFactory, stressService, and stress&lt;|Coustom|Int|String|&gt;Serialization.
  Make sure to run ant buildTest and start up a service container before running
  the tests. </p>
<p>The timestamps used in these tests are all based on java System millisecond
  probes, and thus different accuracy levels will be available on different platforms
  as described at: <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-01/01-qa-0110-timing.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-01/01-qa-0110-timing.html </a></p>
<h3><a name="scalability">Service Container Scalability</a></h3>
<p>Under heavy load the thread pool in the standalone service container might
  need to be customized. </p>
<p>If the server is overloaded you tend to get errors like: </p>
<pre class="command">  java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out. </pre>
<p>  To change the timeout value see: <br>
  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout">http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout <br>
  <br>
  </a>However this does not solve the scalability problem, it just avoids timing
      out. You can increase the thread pool size in the container using the global <strong>containerThreads </strong> setting
      in server-config.wsdd. It defaults to 5. The max number of threads then
      defaults to 4 * that setting. <br>
  Other threading related configs: <br>
  <strong>containerThreadsMax </strong> - max number of threads <br>
  <strong>containerThreadsHighWaterMark </strong> - when the thread pool
      should start shrinking (if number of idle threads exceeds this number) <br>
  <strong>containerThreadsReapInterval </strong> - how often killed threads
        should be cleaned up </p>
<p>Note these configurations only apply to our standalone container. If you use
  a Servlet engine like Tomcat the thread pool features depend on the web server/servlet
  implementation. </p>
