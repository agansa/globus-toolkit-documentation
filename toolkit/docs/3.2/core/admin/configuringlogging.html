&gt;Configuring the Logging Service</p>
<h2>Configuring the Logging Service </h2>
<p>Logging in the Globus Toolkit is based on the Jakarta Commons Logging architecture.
Commons Logging provides a consistent interface for instrumenting source code
while at the same time allowing the user to plug-in a different logging implementation.
The Globus Toolkit implements the Commons Logging interface and provides the
logging implementation.</p>
<p>In addition the Globus Toolkit provides a logging Grid Service with the following
  features:
<ul>
  <li>Dynamically change the runtime logging characteristics of both the hosting
    environment and the services running in it.
  <li>Change the persistent logging configuration.
  <li>Query or subscribe to a rolling window of the log entries as service
      data.
  <li>Query transient and persistent attributes as service data.
  <li>Access to and management of logging as a Grid Service. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging Configuration </h3>
Basic logging is automatically configured and enabled during installation. No
additional configuration is needed to enable logging. This section is provided
so that administrators can change the logging configuration if needed.
<p>This section describes only the static configuration of logging. The OgsiLogging
  service can be used to dynamically change the logging configuration and options
  at runtime. This can done using the service interface from a Grid Service client
  application. A panel is provided as part of the ServiceBrowser as an exmaple.
  For details see the logging service detailed specification.
<p>The following files are used to configure logging:
<ul>
  <li>commons-logging.properties
  <li>ogsilogging_parms.properties
  <li>ogsilogging.properties </li>
</ul>
<h4>commons-logging.properties </h4>
This file is used by Jakarta Commons to find the LogFactory to use when creating
Loggers. It must be in the classpath. This is the entire content: org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory=org.globus.ogsa.impl.core.logging.OGSALogFactory
If the commons-logging.properties file is not found, and assuming a factory was
not specified in the system properties, the behavior of commons LogFactory is
to dynamically discover built-in supported loggers. If the log4j-core.jar file
is found in the classpath, log4j will be used. See the commons Logging LogFactory
javadoc for details regarding LogFactory implementation lookup. <br>
<br>
<h4>ogsilogging_parm.properties </h4>
This file contains 2 parameters:
<p>1. <em>persistentAttributeLocation </em> contains the name of the file which
  contains the detailed logging configuration. It can be fully qualified or relative
  to the current directory. In this example the file is located in the current
  directory. persistentAttributeLocation=ogsilogging.properties
<p>2. <em>logDestinationBasePath </em> contains the base path of log files for
  any logger with a file desination. The default setting is blank, which means
  the current working directory. In the default Globus Toolkit container, this
  defaults to the &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java/ directory. logDestinationBasePath=
<h4>ogsilogging.properties </h4>
This file contains the detailed logging settings for a Globus Toolkit installation.
<p>There is one and only one default setting, which has the following format:
  default=destination,level,group The "default" entry provides logging settings
  for any logger that is not explicitly defined elsewhere in the ogsilogging.properties
  file.
<p>In addition to the default entry, there are configuration entries for individual
  loggers. Individual Logger entries have the following format: logger_name=destination,level,group
<p><em>Logger name </em><br>
  logger_name is a string that matches what the log generating application used
    to define it's logging entries. It is typically the class name of the application
    generating the log information, but it can be any name that binds a set of
    contributors to an identified log stream.
<p><em>Level </em><br>
  The level is the key log-filtering item. There are two views of level: the
    application view, and the administrative view. From the standpoint of the
    log generating application, it selects one of the following levels indicating
    the log message priority:
<ul>
  <li>DEBUG
  <li>TRACE
  <li>INFO
  <li>WARN
  <li>ERROR
  <li>FATAL </li>
</ul>
From the administrative view, the level attribute contained in this file is used
for the hierarchical filtering of log message flows. Valid level attributes,
in hierarchical order are:
<ul>
  <li>ALL or DEBUG
  <li>TRACE
  <li>INFO
  <li>WARN
  <li>ERROR
  <li>FATAL
  <li>OFF </li>
</ul>
The administrator will set a level associated with a logger name from one of
the above. The selection of a particular level enables all log filters below
it. For example, setting level to ALL or DEBUG causes all messages to be logged.
Setting the level to TRACE also causes INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL level messages
to be logged. Setting level to INFO causes WARN, ERROR, FATAL level messages
to be logged, and so on.
<p>Setting level to "OFF" disables all log messages for this logger.
<p><em>Destination </em><br>
  The destination field is either "CONSOLE" or filename. The filename is relative
  and will be pre-pended by the logDestinationBasePath.
<p><em>Group </em><br>
  This is an unmanaged tag, which can be used in group wide operations. An attribute
    can only belong to one group. Group is useful when programmatically changing
    the logging settings for a group of loggers. 
<h4>Configuring The Logging Service </h4>
The OgsiLogging Grid Service is defined in the server-config.wsdd. Following
are the configurable parameters:
<h4></h4>
<p><em>logBufferSize </em> defines the number of entries in the log messages
  buffer. The log message buffer is a rolling (FIFO) list of the latest log messages.
<p><em>logBufferSizeMax </em> defines the maximum size of any change in log buffer
  size.
<h4>Underlying Log Engine </h4>
Ogsi Logging uses Log4j in it's implementation. The log4j-core.jar file should
be in the classpath.
<p>Any application using log4j directly instead of using commons APIs will NOT
  be supported from a logging management standpoint. Any discovered log4j.properties
  file will be in effect for direct users. Commons users will have OGSI Logging
  Management prevail and existing log4j.properties files will have no effect.
  For example, if a category logger is defined in log4j as DEBUG but is defaulted
  by an ogsilogging.properties as WARN, then WARN is the designated log level.
<h4>Logging in Tomcat </h4>
<p>The deployTomcat target takes care of all the required logging setup in the
  Tomcat application server environment.
<h4>Tracing SOAP messages </h4>
Three methods for tracing SOAP messages are described.
<p>1. To trace SOAP messages on the wire you can use TcpMon from Apache Axis.
  After setting the environment using <a href="../../developer/commonclients.html#Environment">setenv scripts </a> you
  can run: java org.apache.axis.utils.tcpmon [listenPort targetHost targetPort]
<p>If no arguments are used, you have to fill out these values in the GUI.
<p>2. One method for logging SOAP messages is to add the org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler
  to the request or response chain in the server-config.wsdd or client-config.wsdd
  files. For example: </p>
&lt;requestFlow&gt; ... &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler"/&gt; ... &lt;requestFlow&gt;
<p>3. Another method for tracing SOAP messages is to enable logging for selected
  Axis classes. Add the following lines to the ogsilogging.properties file: org.apache.client.Call=console,debug
  org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender=console,debug This will cause axis
  client side calls and Axis HTTP messages to be logged.
