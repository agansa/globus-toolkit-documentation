<h1>Data Management  Documentation</h1>
<p>The following links will take you to documentation for the data management
  components of the Globus Toolkit:</p>
<p><a href="gridftp/index.html">GridFTP </a></p>

  <p>GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol optimized
    for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The GridFTP protocol is based on FTP,
    the highly-popular Internet file transfer protocol. We have selected a set
    of protocol features and extensions defined already in IETF RFCs and added
    a few additional features to meet requirements from current data grid projects. </p>
  <p><a href="rft/index.html">RFT </a></p>
  <p>The Reliable File Transfer Service (RFT) is an OGSA based service that provides
    interfaces for controling and monitoring 3rd party file transfers using GridFTP
    servers. The client controlling the transfer is hosted inside of a grid service
    so it can be managed using the soft state model and queried using the ServiceData
    interfaces available to all grid services. It is essentially a reliable and
    recoverable version of the GT2 globus-url-copy tool and more. </p>
  <p><a href="rls/index.html">RLS </a></p>
  <p>The Replica Location Service (RLS) maintains and provides access to mapping
    information from logical names for data items to target names. These target
    names may represent physical locations of data items, or an entry in the
    RLS may map to another level of logical naming for the data item. </p>
