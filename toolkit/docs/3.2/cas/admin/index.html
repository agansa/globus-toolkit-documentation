<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The CAS Administrator clients can be used to manipulate and maintain
the data in the CAS database. The CAS Administrator typically performs the 
following operations:</p>
<ul> 
<li>enroll and un-enroll CAS Objects</li>
<li>create and delete groups</li>
<li>add and remove members from groups</li>
<li>add and remove service type and action mappings</li>
</ul>

<p>
All enroll operations involve granting cas/grantAll permission on the
enrolled object to some user group (to which the user may belong to or
otherwise).</p>
<p>
All operations require that the user have specific permissions to
perform the operation. Permissions and policies are given and applied
to user groups. Hence a user is said to have permission to perform an
operation if one of the user groups that the user belongs to has
permission to perform that operation.</p>
<p>
If some user group to which the user belongs to has permission
"superuser" on CAS server object, then they may perform any operation,
even if they do not have specific rights that are outlined below for
each operation.</p>
<p>
If a user has cas/grantAll permission on any object, then the user is
permitted to perform any operations on that object.</p>
<p> 
The CAS Query commands do not alter the state of the database and
any CAS user who has cas/query permissions may use the commands to
retrieve data from the CAS server.</p>

<p>
Scripts have been provided for all command line clients. The scripts
are placed in GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to be added to
the PATH to be able to execute these scripts from other location. An
environment variable <i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i> must be set to point to
GT3.2 Install Location. Some of the options that are common to all the
clients are described here.</p>
