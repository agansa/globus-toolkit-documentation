<h2><a name="admin-example">Example of CAS Server Administration</a> </h2>
Alice, Bob and Carol are three members of a community who have set up a 
Community Authorization Service (CAS). Alice's role is primarily to administer 
the CAS server. Bob is an analyst who needs read access to much of the community 
data. Carol is a scientist who needs to be able to both read and write community 
data. 
<p>These examples show how Alice adds the users Bob and Carol to the CAS server, 
then adds an FTP server with some data available to the community and then adds 
permissions for the users of the CAS administration clients. </p>
<p>These examples assume that Alice has installed the CAS server and 
bootstrapped the database with herself as super user. Please refer to the
<a href="../../installation/install_config_cas.html">
installation documentation</a> for details. </p>
<p>Assume Alice's nickname on the CAS server is <i>alice</i> and at bootstrap 
she created a user group <i>suGroup</i>, which has super user permissions on the 
database. Say, the CAS service URL is <i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i>
</p>
<p>All commands listed below assume that the environment variable
<font face="Courier New">GLOBUS_LOCATION</font> has been set to point to the
GT3.2  core install and that the commands are run from <font face="Courier New">
GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin</font>. Also, we assume an environment variable
<font face="Courier New">CAS_SERVER_URL</font> has been set to point to the CAS
 server URL: <i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i> </p>
<p><b>1. Adding a user group </b></p>
<p>Since at the time of booting up the CAS server, only one user group that has 
super user permissions on the CAS server is created, Alice might want to create 
another user group to which new users may be added and permissions to newly 
enrolled CAS entities may be given. This also eases the process of giving the 
same rights to many users. Given they are two types of roles in the community, 
she might want to create two groups, <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>. </p>
<p>All permissions on the newly created group will be given to users of a 
particular user group. Alice would like all users of the user group <i>analysts</i> 
to be able to manipulate the group. </p>
<p>To <a href="commandline.html#usergroups">create a new user group</a>, 
Alice uses the <i>cas-group-admin</i> client. It requires a name for the new 
group being created, so she uses <i>analysts</i>. </p>
<pre class="command">alice%  cas-group-admin user create analysts analysts
</pre>
This will create a user group <i>analysts</i> that gives all users in that group 
the permission to manage the group (i.e., add users, remove users and so on.) 
She can similarly create a group called <i>scientist</i>.<p><b>2. Adding trust 
anchor</b></p>
<p>Before she can add Bob and Carol to the CAS server, Alice needs to ensure 
that the trust anchors for both have been added. If they share the same trust 
anchor with Alice, she can skip this step since Alice's trust anchor would have 
been added to the database at bootstrap. </p>
<p>But in this example, Alice and Carol share a trust anchor different from 
Bob's. Alice needs to <a href="commandline.html#trustanchors">add the trust 
anchor</a> used by Bob by using <i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>trustAnchor</i> 
option. She needs to provide details about the trust anchor such as the 
authentication method and authentication data used. </p>
<pre class="command">alice%  cas-enroll trustAnchor analysts AbcTrust X509 &quot;/C=US/O=some/CN=ABC CA&quot;
</pre>
The above will enroll a trust anchor with the nickname <i>AbcTrust</i>, who uses 
the <i>X509</i> authentication method and has the DN specified in the command. 
The members of the <i>analysts</i> user group are given all rights on this 
object. This implies that any user who has this trust anchor presents 
credentials signed by this trust anchor. 
<p><b>3. Adding users</b> </p>
<p>Alice can now <a href="commandline.html#users">add Bob and Carol as 
users</a> using the <i>cas-enroll</i> command with the <i>user</i> option. She 
needs to provide the user's subject DN and reference to the user's trust anchor. 
As with any entity added to the CAS server, Alice needs to choose a user group 
whose members will have all permissions on that entity. Alice would like the 
members of user group <i>suUser</i> to be able to manipulate the user entity <i>
Bob</i>, so she enters: </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-enroll user suUser bob &quot;/O=Our Community/CN=Bob Foo&quot; AbcTrust
</pre>
Alice uses a similar command to add Carol to the CAS database. 
<p><b>4. Adding users to user group</b></p>
<p>The CAS server only allows rights to be assigned to user groups and <b>not</b> 
to individual users. Hence, before Alice can assign rights to Bob or Carol, she 
needs to add them to a user group. She does this by using the&nbsp; <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> 
client with the <i>user</i> option to indicate she is adding a user to a user 
group. This client requires the group name and nickname of the user to be added. 
So to add Bob to the <i>analysts</i> group, Alice enters: </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-group-add-entry user analysts bob
</pre>
<p>If a user group <i>scientists</i> was created, Carol could be added as a 
member in the same way. </p>
<p><b>4. Adding a new FTP server</b></p>
<p>So far, Alice has the community users in the database and organized. She now 
wants to add some resources. The community currently has a single FTP server 
available, called foo.bar.edu, so she will add this to the CAS database. </p>
<p>Each resource or object in the CAS server has a namespace associated to it 
that defines certain features (like the comparison algorithm.) When the object 
name is used, the namespace is also called for comparison. The base URL that 
should be prefixed to the object connected to this namespace may also be used.</p>
<p>In this case, Alice uses the <i>FTPDirectoryTree</i> namespace that is added 
to the CAS server at boot up. Now, she adds the FTP server to the CAS database, 
using the <i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>object</i> option. </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/* FTPDirectoryTree
</pre>
This adds the FTP server as an object and gives all members of the <i>suGroup</i> 
rights to manipulate the object. 
<p>To be able to grant/revoke access on indiviual directories, objects with the 
directory. Say, if Alice would like to be able to manipulate the <i>data</i> on 
the server as a separate entity, the the following will add an object for that.
</p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/* FTPDirectoryTree
</pre>
<p><b>4. Creating an object group </b></p>
<p>Alice suspects the community will end up have more directories containing 
data on other servers that will have identical polices as the /data directory on 
foo.bar.edu. So she is going to create an object group called <i>data</i> and 
assign foo.bar.edu/data to this group. This will allow her to grant rights on 
this group and easily add other directories to this group later </p>
<p>To create a group called <i>data</i> she uses the <i>cas-group-admin</i> 
client with <i>group</i> and <i>create</i> option. </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-group-admin object create suGroup data
</pre>
This creates an object group called <i>data</i> and the members of <i>suGroup</i> 
get all rights on this group and hence should be able to add/remove members, 
grant rights to add/delete from this group to others and also delete this group. 
<p><b>5. Adding members to object group </b></p>
<p>Alice now can add foo.bar.edu/data to the <i>data</i> group. She can do this 
by using the <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> with the <i>object</i> option. To add 
the above described object, <i>ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*</i> in namespace <i>
FooFTPNamespace</i>, to object group <i>data</i>, the following would be the 
command. </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-group-add-entry object data object FooFTPNamespace ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*
</pre>
In the above command, the first <i>object</i> refers to the group type, <i>data</i> 
is the name of the object group, <i>object</i> refers to the type of CAS entity 
that is being added as memeber and the last two parameters define the namespace 
and the object that needs to be added. 
<p><b>6. Adding service types </b></p>
<p>Alice now needs to add information about the kind of rights that can be 
granted for these objects. These are stored as <i>service types</i> and relevant 
actions are mapped to these service types. </p>
<p>In this scenario, the kind of service types that Alice should add would be <i>
file</i>, <i>directory</i> and so on. To do so, the <i>cas-enroll</i> client 
with <i>serviceType</i> option maybe used. To add a service type called <i>file</i> 
and give members of <i>suGroup</i> all rights on this service type, she uses the 
following command. </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-enroll serviceType suGroup file
</pre>
<p><b>7. Adding action mappings </b></p>
<p>The relevant action mappings to the above mentioned service types would be <i>
read</i>, <i>write</i> and so on. Alice needs to add these mappings to the 
database so that she can grant rights that allow a user to have <i>file/read</i> 
or <i>file/write</i> permissions on some object. </p>
<p>To add action mappings to a service type, she uses the <i>cas-action</i> 
client with <i>add</i> option. The following command should add a mapping of 
action <i>read</i> to service type <i>file</i>. </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-action add file add
</pre>
Similarly she can add other mapping like <i>write</i> to this service type. 
<p><b>8. Grant permissions. </b></p>
<p>Alice now has resources in the object group <i>data</i> and users in the user 
groups <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>. She now wants to grant permissions 
on <i>data</i> group to the analysts and scientists, namely read permissions to 
the analysts and read and write permissions to the scientists. </p>
<p>To grant permissions the <i>cas-rights-admin</i> with the <i>grant</i> option 
needs to be used. To give read permissions to the analysts group, the command 
that needs to be run would be </p>
<pre class="command">alice% cas-rights-admin grant analysts objectGroup data serviceAction file read</pre>
She similarly grants rights to <i>scientists</i> group. 
<p>And now Alice is done!</p>
