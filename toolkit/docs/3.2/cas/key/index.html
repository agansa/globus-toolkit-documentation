<h1>CAS: Key Concepts</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Building on the Globus Toolkit™ Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), CAS allows
    resource providers to specify course-grained access control policies in terms
    of communities as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control policy
  management to the community itself. </p>
<p>Resource providers maintain ultimate authority over
    their resources but are spared day-to-day policy administration tasks (e.g.
  adding and deleting users, modifying user privileges).</p>

<h2><a name="casprocess">CAS: Process</a></h2>
<p>How it works: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A CAS server is initiated for a community: a community representative acquires
    a GSI credential to represent that community as a whole, and then runs a
    CAS server using that community identity.
    <br>  
  <li>Resource providers grant privileges to the community. Each resource provider
      verifies that the holder of the community credential represents that community
      and that the community's policies are compatible with the resource provider's
      own policies. Once a trust relationship has been established, the resource
      provider then grants rights to the community identity, using normal local
      mechanisms (e.g. gridmap files and disk quotas, filesystem permissions,
      etc.)
    <br>  
  <li>Community representatives use the CAS to manage the community's trust
      relationships (e.g., to enroll users and resource providers into the community
      according to the community's standards) and grant fine-grained access control
      to resources. The CAS server is also used to manage its own access control
      policies; for example, community members who have the appropriate privileges
      may authorize additional community members to manage groups, grant permissions
      on some or all of the community's resources, etc.
    <br>  
  <li>When a user wants to access resources served by the CAS, that user makes
      a request to the CAS server. If the CAS server's database indicates that
      the user has the appropriate privileges, the CAS issues the user a GSI
      restricted proxy credential with an embedded policy giving the user the
      right to perform the requested actions.
    <br>  
  <li>The user then uses the credentials from the CAS to connect to the resource
      with any normal Globus tool (e.g. GridFTP). The resource then applies its
      local policy to determine the amount of access granted to the community,
      and further restricts that access based on the policy in the CAS credentials,
      This serves to limit the user's privileges to the intersection of those
      granted by the CAS to the user and those granted by the resource provider
  to the community. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="licensing"></a>Licensing Considerations </h2>
<p>This version of CAS uses the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  standard. Users should be aware that RSA Security has identified four patents
  it believes could be relevant to implementing certain operational modes of
  the SAML specifications. The Globus Alliance has established a license agreement
  with RSA covering usage of SAML in the Globus Toolkit, however users who redistribute
  SAML-enabled portions of the Globus Toolkit or use SAML-enabled portions in
  their own applications should understand the issue and may want to obtain a
  royalty-free license from RSA. <br>
