<h2>CAS Requests </h2>
<p>CAS requests can be broadly classified into administrative requests and query
  requests. Each CAS request requires some set of permissions. These permission
  are assessed by looking up the authenticated user in the user table, (to get
  the CAS nickname mapped to this user) and using that to check if the policy table
  has a permission defined for the operation as described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>This page contains the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#adminReq">CAS Administrative Requests</a></li>
  <li><a href="#queryReq">CAS Query Requests</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="adminReq">CAS Administrative Requests </a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Administrative requests typically modify the database and are used to add
    or remove CAS table entries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enroll or unenroll trust anchor </li>
    <li>Enroll or unenroll user </li>
    <li>Create or delete namespace </li>
    <li>Create or delete objects </li>
    <li>Create or delete service type </li>
    <li>Add or remove service type/action mappings </li>
    <li>Create or delete user, object or service action groups </li>
    <li>Add or remove entries from any of the above </li>
    <li>defined groups </li>
    <li>grant or revoke permissions </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above request asserts permissions and performs the operation preserving
    the database consistency. For example, a policy can be defined (or right can
    be granted) only on objects that exist in the CAS database and so on.
  </p>
  <p>Creation of any CAS object (like a trust anchor, namespace, object, user,
    service type, user group, object group, service_action group), allows the client
    to choose a user group, (irrespective of whether the client belongs to the
    group or not), to which all permissions on the newly created object is granted.
    In the case of the operation where the user creates a new user group, if the
    client chooses to grant all permissions to the newly created user group, then
    the user is added to the new group.

<h3><a name="queryReq">CAS Query Requests </a></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Query request are classified into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>requests that return assertions that are typically signed and can be
            used by the client to authorize with some resource. </li>
      <li>requests that return information about the current state of the CAS
        database. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Assertion requests </h4>
    <p>The CAS server supports requests to retrieve policy information as signed
                  policy assertion. These assertions can be presented at a resource by the
                  client for authorization purposes. A policy assertion includes a list of
                  policy statements, the distinguished name of the user that the permissions
                  apply to, a validity period (a start and end time corresponding to when
                  the assertion is valid), and is signed by the CAS server. Each of the requests
                  for policy assertions takes a lifetime argument (the desired lifetime of
                  the policy assertion, in seconds) and the following is done to generate
            them. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The applicable user is identified as described <a href="permissions.html">here </a>. </li>
      <li>Applicable set of policy statements for the user are identified
                        as described <a href="permissions.html">here </a>. </li>
      <li>If the set is not empty, policy assertion is created or else
                        null is returned. </li>
      <li>The assertion lifetime is calculated as follows. If the requested
                                  lifetime is 0, the server's default lifetime
          is used, otherwise, the minimum of the requested lifetime and the server's
        maximum lifetime is used. </li>
      <li>The list of {service/action, object} permissions, the validity
                                  time (start time is the current time, end time
          is the current time plus the assertion lifetime), and the applicable
        user's subject name is formatted into a assertion. </li>
      <li>The assertion is signed and returned to the requestor. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the current implementation, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML),
                  standard defined by <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS </a>, is
                  used for exchange of request for authorization assertions and response. <a href="http://www.opensaml.org">OpenSAML </a>,
                  an open source implementation of the SAML 1.0 specification has been used
                  as a utility to generate and process SAML Queries and Assertions.
    </p>
    <p>The &quot;getAssertion&quot; method with right parameters
            maybe used for these requests.For each requested permission, if
            there is a policy statement granting the request in the CAS
            database, then the requested (service/action, object) is added
      to the returned assertion as a decision statement. </p>
    <p>Assertion generation is done based primarily based on the
            objects. This has implications in the case of a requests where
            all applicable polices are returned. The service restricts
            polices only based on objects and does not make a distinction on
            the service type. For example, if a non-implicit object has a
            CAS service type policy on it, that will be returned as a part
            of the assertion.  Might be useful in case some other CAS server
            itself being treated as an external resource and the cas service
      types are used) </p>
    <h4>Non-assertion queries </h4>
    <p> These are requests that can be used to query the CAS service for information.
        Some of the queries supported are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> List of all CAS Objects of a give type. E.g. list of all
               users.</li>
      <li> User's nickname which returns the CAS nickname of the person
               making the query</li>
      <li> List of all members of a given group. E.g. list of all members
               of user group foo. </li>
      <li> List of all policies for a given CAS Object. E.g. list of all
               policies on a user name foobar. </li>
      <li> Details about a given CAS object. E.g. Details about user foo
                 would include the user nickname, subject name, trust anchor and
               groups the user belongs to. </li>
    </ul>
