<h1>Database Design</h1>
<p>The CAS database contains a number of tables to store information about users,
  resources (objects), actions and policies. This section describes each of those
  tables and their contents. The tables are categorized into tables used to identify
  and organize users in the database (trust_anchor, user and user_group), tables
  used to describe actions service_type, service_type_action, service_type_action_groups),
  tables used to describe and organize resources or objects (object, object namespace
  and object_group) and tables used to describe policies (policy_statement).</p>
<p>This page contains the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#tablesusers">Tables relating to users</a></li>
  <li><a href="#tablesactions">Tables relating to actions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#tablesresourceobjects">Tables relating to resources/objects</a></li>
  <li><a href="#tablespolicy">Tables relating to policy statements </a> </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="tablesusers">Tables relating to users</a></h2>
There are two categories of people in the CAS database, the trust anchors and
the users. The users may further be placed in user groups and the granularity
of operation in the CAS database, with respect to users, is user group.
<h3><a name="trust_anchor">trust_anchor</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table describes authorities that can generate credentials.
      It consists of tuples with {trust_anchor_nickname, authentication_method,
      authentication_data} tuples. In general, the meaning of one of these tuples
      is "database entries that refer to trust_anchor_nickname apply to the authority
      represented by authentication_data for authentication method authentication_method". </p>
  <p>The current implementation supports the following contents in these
            fields: an authentication_method of "x509" and authentication_data
  is the certificate authority's CA certificate. </p>
  <p>A trust_anchor_nickname
              uniquely identifies an authentication_method and authentication_data
              across the database. </p>
  <p>For example, {globus_ca, x509, &lt;contents of the globus CA cert&gt; }
            associates the name globus_ca with the Globus CA certificate. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="user">user</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table consists of {user_nickname, trust_anchor_nickname, subject_name}
        tuples, which map raw authentication information into the symbolic names
        that appear in CAS user specifications. The meaning of this tuple is
    database entries that refer to user_nickname apply to the user who authenticates
    as subject_name using the authentication mechanism and credentials generated
        by trust_anchor_nickname.
  </p>
  <p>The current implementation supports a subject_name which is a X509 distinguish
          name of the user.
  </p>
  <p>A subjectDN and trust anchor nick name uniquely identifies an entry
              in the user_table, that is there is a one to one mapping between a
              user nickname and the combination of subjectDN and trust anchor nickname.
  </p>
  <p>For example, the tuple {user1, globus_ca, "/O=Globus/CN=User1 Name")
              means that the person who can authenticate using authentication method
              of the trust anchor globus_ca with subject name "/O=Globus/CN=User1
              Name" CA has the permissions assigned to the user "user1" within
              the CAS database. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="user-group">user_group</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table maintains a list of all user groups in the CAS database. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="user_group_entry">user_group_entry</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table consists of {group, user} tuples implying that
      the specified user is a member of the group. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="tablesactions">Tables relating to actions</a></h2>
The database includes tables related to action specifications. Different services
may define actions that have similar (or identical) names with different meanings
and hence an action specification must include a service type in addition to
the name of the action. The resource servers that receive CAS policy statements
interpret the service types and actions. For example, a GridFTP server may honor
policy statements that refer to the "file" service type and ignore policy statements
for all other service types. In theory (because all this processing is done by
the resource servers and not the CAS server), there's no need for the CAS server
to keep track of allowable service types and actions. However, it is done to
make it easier for administrators to detect and avoid errors while setting permissions.
<p>The server also supports grouping of these service action mappings. Permissions
  may be granted to the service action groups or to a single service action.
<h3><a name="service_type">service_type</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table lists all the service types in the database.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="service_type_action">service_type_action</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table consists of {service_type, action} tuples
          implying that the specified action is valid for the specified service
    type. For example, a {service_type, action} of {file, read} means that read
    is a valid action for the service type file. This mapping is represents as "serviceType/action" in
          the current implementation. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="service_action_group">service_action_group</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table lists all the service action group names.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="service_action_group_entry">service_action_group_entry</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This table contains the following tuple (group, service/action). The tuple
        indicates that the service/action belongs to group. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="tablesresourceobjects">Tables relating to resources/objects</a></h2>
An object specification refers to an object or group of objects. An "object" may
itself refer to either a single physical object (e.g., a file) or a collection
of objects (e.g., all files within a directory). A given object is relevant within
a namespace defined and the properties of the namespace apply to the object.
<h3><a name="namespace_table">namespace_table</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This table stores the following tuple (nickname, basename, comparisonAlg)
      implying that objects with in the namespace referred to as nickname in
      the CAS database are compared using the comparisonAlg and have a base URL(FIXME
      explain namespace better, correctly ?) of basename. A namespace uniquely
      identifies a single physical resource. For example, a namespace (ftpNS1,
      ftp://sample1.org/, wildcard) implies that all object names within the
      realm of this namespace, are to be compared using wildcard matching. Each
      comparison algorithm corresponds to a class with in the CAS server implementation
      an interface that defines routines for matching objects.</p>
  <p>The current implementation supports exact match and wildcard matching.
            Objects are represented as "objectNamespace|objectName" in the current
          implementation. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="object">object</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> This table stores the object name and the namespace that this object is
    in. For example, (/mydir/*, ftpNS1) implies that this object is within the
    ftpNs1 namespace, described above. Since this has wild card matching and
    hence /mydir/foo would match this object. CAS Objects can be either implicit,
    that is those that are inherent to CAS or explicit, that is objects on other
    resources about which policies may be stored in the CAS database. While implict
    objects maybe of many types, external objects are always represented as type "object". </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Implicit Objects </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>  It is sometimes convenient to treat some of the entities defined within the
      CAS server (such as users and groups) as objects. These implicit objects
      can be added to object groups and can appear in policy statements. Such
      policy statements govern access permissions to the CAS database. The types
      of implicit objects are:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
    <ul>
      <li>A user (a reference to an entry in the user table).This is used when
                granting permissions such as "may unenroll this user"
      <li>A user_group (a reference to an entry in the user_group table). This
                is used to grant permissions such as "may add users to this group".
      <li>A service_type (a reference to an entry in the service_type table).
                    This is used when granting permissions such as "may add actions
                    to this service type";
      <li>An object_group (a reference to an entry in the object_group
                    table). This is used when granting permissions such as "may add
                    objects to this object group".
      <li>A namespace (reference to an entry in namespace table). This
                    is used when granting permission like "may unenroll this namespace"
      <li>A trust anchor (reference to an entry in the trust_anchor_table);
                    this is used when granting permissions like "may grant rights on
                    this trust anchor"
      <li>The CAS server itself; this is used when granting permissions
                    such as "may add new users to the CAS server". This is added at
            start up to the object_table. </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h3><a name="object_group">object_group</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This table lists the names of object groups in the database.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="object_group_entry">object_group_entry</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This table consists of {object_group, objectSpecification,
      objectSpecDesc} tuples; the meaning of this tuple is that the specified
      objectSpecification of the type objectSpecDesc is a member of the specified
      object group. The objectSpecification could be an identifier for one of
      these objectSpecDesc, an object(implicit or explicit), user, user group,
    service type, namespace or trust anchor. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="tablespolicy">Tables relating to policy statements</a></h2>
The CAS server keeps track of policy statements, which are composed of three
parts: a user specification, which denotes a user or set of users, an action
specification, which denotes an operation (e.g., read a file) or a group of operation,
and an object specification, which specifies an object or group of objects.
<p>For example, if we were to specify a policy statement as an English sentence, "User1
  may read ftp://myhost.edu/myfile", then the user specification would be "User1",
  the action specification would be "file/read", and the object specification
  would be ftp://myhost.edu/myfile. In reality, the CAS server maintains this
  information as entries in database tables and translates it into a policy language
  when responding to a query.
<h3><a name="policy_statement">policy_statement</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>  The policy_statement table consists of (userGroup, actionSpec, actionSpecDesc,
      objectSpec, objectSpecDesc) corresponding to policy statement that implies
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>userGroup - a reference to an entry in user_group table </li>
    <li>actionSpec - a reference to an entry in service_action table
                          or service_action_group table </li>
    <li>actionSpecDesc - either "serviceAction" or "serviceActionGroup" describing
                      the actionSpec entry </li>
    <li>objectSpec - a reference to an entry in object table, object_group_entry
                          table, user table, user_group table, service_type table,
          namespace table or trust_anchor table. </li>
    <li>objectSpecDesc - either "object", "objectGroup", "user", "userGroup", "serviceType", "namespace" or "trustAnchor" describing
                the objectSpec entry. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each statement implies that users who belong to the userGroup are permitted to
    perform the service/action or all service/action(s) in the serviceActionGroup
    on the specified object or all objects in the said object group.
