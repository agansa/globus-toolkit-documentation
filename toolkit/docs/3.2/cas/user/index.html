<p>A typical CAS user will use only two CAS-specific commands: <em>cas-proxy-init </em>,
  which contacts a CAS server and obtains a credential, and <em>cas-wrap </em>,
  which wraps a grid-enabled client program, causing that client program to use
  the credential that was previously generated using <em>cas-proxy-init </em>.</p>
<p>For example, a day in the life of a CAS user might look something like this: </p>
<p>1. In the morning, the user runs:</p>
<pre class="command"> % grid-proxy-init % cas-proxy-init -t <em>tag </em> </pre>
<p>The first line generates a Globus proxy credential; the second uses that credential
  to contact the CAS server and retrieve a CAS credential that includes all the
  permissions granted to the user by the community. The <em>tag </em> argument
  can be any string and is used to assign a name for that credential ( <em>cas-wrap </em> uses
  this name to locate the credential). </p>
<p>2. Several times throughout the day, the user runs commands that look like: </p>
<pre class="command">% cas-wrap -t <em>tag grid-enabled-program args </em> </pre>
<p>This runs the program <em>grid-enabled-program </em> with arguments <em>args </em>,
  using the CAS credential that had been created by and assigned the name <em>tag </em>.
  For example: </p>
<pre class="command">% cas-wrap -t my-community gsincftp myhost.edu </pre>
<p>looks for a CAS credential with the name "my-community" (e.g., a credential
  that had been created using "cas-proxy-init -t my-community") and then runs
  the command "gsincftp myhost.edu", causing the gsincftp program to use that
  CAS credential to authenticate. </p>
<p>3. At the end of the day, the user runs: </p>
<pre class="command">% cas-wrap -t <em>tag </em> grid-proxy-destroy </pre>
<p>to destroy the CAS credential, and: </p>
<pre class="command">% grid-proxy-destroy </pre>
<p>to destroy the Globus proxy credential.Or the user might simply let both credentials
  expire. </p>
