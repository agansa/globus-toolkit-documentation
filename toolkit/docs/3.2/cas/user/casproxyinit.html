<h2>Generating CAS credentials (cas-proxy-init)</h2>
<p>The syntax of the <em>cas-proxy-init </em> program is: </p>

<p class="command">cas-proxy-init [ <em>options </em>] [ -t <em>tag </em> | -p <em>proxyfile </em> ]
</p>
<p>This program contacts the CAS server, obtains a credential, and places that
  credential into a file. If "-p <em>proxyfile </em>" is used, then the credential
  is placed in the file named <em>proxyfile </em>; if "-t <em>tag </em>" is used,
  then cas-proxy-init chooses a filename based on the value of <em>tag </em>.
<p>A environment variable, GLOBUS_LOCATION needs to be set to point to the GT3.2 install location. If CAS clients have been deployed, then this script is placed
  in GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to be added to the PATH for it
  to be executed from other locations. </p>
<p>The other options that can be used with <em>cas-proxy-init </em> are: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="127"><p><strong>-c </strong><em>url </em></p></td>
    <td valign="top" width="463"><p>Contact URL for the CAS server. This typically
        looks like, http:// <em>GT3Host </em>: <em>GT3Port </em>/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService
        where <em>GT3Host </em> and <em>GT3Port </em> are host and port where
        container with CAS service is running. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>-s </strong><em>server_identity </em></p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>When doing mutual authentication with the CAS server,
        expect <em>server_identity </em> as the remote identity. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>-f </strong><em>policy_file </em></p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Generate a CAS credential that includes only those permissions
        specified in file <em>policy_file </em> (the default is to generate a
        credential with all the user's permissions). </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>-l </strong><em>hours </em></p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Generate a credential that will time out after <em>hours </em> hours.
        This is a request for lifetime, but the CAS server may have a set maximum
        for the assertion lifetime which will be enforced. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <em>cas-proxy-init </em> program also consults environment variables to
  determine the appropriate URL to connect to and server identity to expect.The
  URL is determined using this algorithm: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <strong>-c </strong> option was specified, use the URL specified
    with that option is used.
  <li>Otherwise, if the <strong>CAS_SERVER_URL </strong> environment variable
      is set, use the value of that variable as the URL. </li>
</ul>
<p>The server identity is determined in a similar fashion: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <strong>-s </strong> option was specified, use the identity specified
    with that option
  <li>Otherwise, if the <strong>CAS_SERVER_IDENTITY </strong> environment variable
      is set, use the value of that variable as the expected server identity.
  <li>If neither is set, host authorization is done and the expected server
      credential is <em>cas/ </em>, where is the fully qualified domain name
      of the host on which the CAS service is up. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting specific CAS rights </h3>
<p>It is possible to request specific permissions from the CAS server using the <strong>-f </strong> option.
  This option causes <em>cas-proxy-init </em> to read a set of requested rights
  from a file. </p>
<p>This file should contain one or more resource identifiers: </p>
Resource: <em>ResourceNamesapce </em>| <em>ResourceName </em>
<p>For each resource, one or more actions identifers: </p>
<em>serviceType action </em>
<p>For example, if the client needed assertions for "file/read" service/action
  for resource "ftp://sample.org" and "ftp://sample3.org", both in "FTPNamespace" and "directory/read" and "directory/write" permissions
  on the former resource only, the policy file should have the following entries: </p>
Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org file read directory read directory write
Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample3.org file read
<p>To indicate any resource, the following wildcard notation should be used.
  uri:samlResourceWildcard
<p>To indicate any action, the following wildcard notation for serviceType and
  action should be used. Note that this should be the first (and clearly the
  only action) in the list of action specified. All other actions in the list
  are ignored and if it is not the first, it is not treated as wildcard. uri:samlActionNSWildcard
  uri:samlActionWildcard
<p>For example, if the client needs assertions for all resources and all actions
  the policy file should look like. Resource: uri:samlResourceWildcard uri:samlActionNSWildcard
  uri:samlActionWildcard
<p>If the client needs assertions for all actions on resource "FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org",
  the policy file should be as follows Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org
uri:samlActionNSWildcard uri:samlActionWildcard
