<h2> The GT3.2 Architecture (three 
pillars)</h2>
<p>Grid Services are only a small (but important) 
part of the whole GT3.2 Architecture, which offers developers plenty of services
for Grid programming. </p>

<p>Grid Services, which you have already seen, are the 'GT3.2 Core' layer. Let's 
take a look at the rest of the layers from the bottom up: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>GT3.2 Security Services</strong>: Security is an important 
		factor in grid-based applications. GT3.2 Security Services can help us 
		restrict access to our Grid Services, so only authorized clients can use 
		them. For example, you said that only our New York, Los Angeles, and 
		Seattle offices could access MathService. You want to make sure only 
		those offices have access to MathService. Besides the usual security 
		measures (putting the web server behind a firewall, etc.) GT3.2 gives us 
		one more layer of security with technologies such as SSL and X.509 
		digital certificates. </li>
	<li><strong>GT3.2 Base Services</strong>: This layer actually includes a 
		whole lot of interesting services: 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Managed Job Service</strong>: Also known as GRAM(?). Suppose some particular 
			operation in MathService might take hours or even days to be done. 
			Of course, you don't want to simply stand in front of a computer 
			waiting for the result to arrive (specially if, after 8 hours of 
			waiting, all you get might simply be an error message!) You need to be 
			able to check on the progress of the operation periodically, and 
			have some control over it (pause it, stop it, etc.) This is usually 
			called <em>job management</em> (in this case, the term 'job' is used 
			instead of 'operation'). 
			</li>
			<li><strong>Index Service</strong>: Remember from
			<a href="http://www.casa-sotomayor.net/gt3-tutorial-working/start/key/web_services.html">A short introduction to 
			Web Services</a> that you usually know what 
			type of Web Service you need, but you have no idea of where they are. 
			This also happens with Grid Services: you might know you need a Grid 
			Service which meets certain requirements, but you have no idea of 
			what its location is. While this was solved in Web Services with 
			UDDI, GT3.2 has its own Index Service. For example, you could have 
			several dozen MathServices all around the country, each with 
			different characteristics (some might be better suited for 
			statistical analysis, while others might me better for performing 
			simulations). Index Service will allow is to query what MathService 
			meets our particular requirements. </li>
			<li><strong>Reliable File Transfer (RFT) Service</strong>: This 
			service allows us to perform large file transfers between the client 
			and the Grid Service. For example, suppose you have an operation in 
			MathService which has to crunch several gigabytes of raw data (for a 
			statistical analysis, for example). Of course, we're not going to 
			send all that information as parameters. We'll be able to send it as 
			a file. Furthermore, RFT guarantees the transfer will be reliable 
			(hence its name). For example, if a file transfer is interrupted 
			(due to a netwok failure, for example), RFT allows us to restart the 
			file transfer from the moment it broke down, instead of starting all 
			over again. </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>GT3.2 Data Services</strong>: This layer includes <em>Replica 
		Management</em>, which is very useful in applications that have to deal 
		with very big sets of data. When working with large amount of data, 
		we're usually not interested in downloading the whole thing, you just 
		want to work with a small part of all that data. Replica Management 
		keeps track of those <em>subsets</em> of data you will be working with.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Other Grid Services</strong>: Other non-GT3.2 services can run 
		on top of the GT3.2 Architecture. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have an understanding of the fundamental concepts of the Globus 
Toolkit 3.2. But there is another important facet of the toolkit: <a href="security_concepts.html">Security</a>.</p>
