<h2> OGSA, OGSI, and GT3.2</h2>
<p>The Globus Toolkit is a software toolkit that allows us to program grid-based 
applications. The third and latest version of the toolkit is based on something 
called <em>Grid Services</em>. Before defining Grid Services, we're going to see 
how Grid Services are related to a lot of acronyms you've probably heard but aren't quite sure what they mean. The following diagram 
summarizes the major players in the Grid Service world: </p>

<p><strong>Grid Services are defined by OGSA.</strong> The <b>Open Grid Services
     Architecture (OGSA)</b> aims to define a new common and standard architecture
     for  grid-based applications. At the center of this new architecture is
     the  concept of a <b>Grid Service</b>. OGSA <em>defines</em> what Grid Services
     are, what  they should be capable of, and what types of technologies they
     should be based on.  However, OGSA does <b>not</b> give a technical and
     detailed specification (which would be needed  to implement a Grid Service).
See <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.0/ogsa/docs/physiology.pdf">Physiology
of the Grid</a> for an introduction to OGSA. </p>
<p><strong>Grid Services are specified by OGSI.</strong> The <b>Open Grid Services 
Infrastructure (OGSI)</b> is a formal and technical specification of the concepts
described in OGSA, including Grid Services. </p>
<p><strong>The Globus Toolkit 3 is an implementation of OGSI.</strong> GT3.2 is a 
usable implementation of everything that is specified in OGSI (and, therefore, 
of everything that is defined in OGSA). </p>
<p><strong>Grid Services are based on Web Services.</strong> Grid Services are 
an <em>extension</em> of Web Services. Both Web Services and Grid Services are 
discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p><b>Consider the following example.</b> Suppose you want to build a new house. 
The first thing you need to do is to hire an architect to draw up the 
blueprints, so you can get an idea of what your house will look like. Once 
you're happy with the architect's job, it's time to hire an engineer who will 
plan all the construction details (where to put the master beams, the power 
cables, the plumbing, etc.). The engineer then passes all his plans to qualified 
professional workers (construction workers, electricians, plumbers, etc) who 
will actually build the house. </p>
<p>You could say that OGSA (the definition) are the blueprints the architect 
creates to show what the building looks like, OGSI (the specification) is the 
structural design that the engineer creates to support the architect's vision 
for the building, and the GT3.2 is the bricks, cement, and beams used to build the 
building to the engineer's specifications. The finished building would be a 
GT3-based application. </p>
