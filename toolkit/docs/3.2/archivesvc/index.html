Archive Service &lt;</p>
<h1>Introduction to the Archive Service</h1>
<p class="style1">[need some info about the status of this service for 3.2 - it comes with xx
  and you can do yy with it??]</p>
<p>The Archive Service (AS) is a new proposed Grid Service designed to facilitate
  the preservation of Service Data history.&nbsp; That is, while the Index Servicereplaces
  existing data with newly received data, the AS will accumulate Service Data
  values over time, according to various optional storage management strategies.&nbsp; Because
  the Index Service stores only the latest data received, it can keep this data
  in memory and the data can be fairly rapidly recreated when the Index Service
  is restarted and begins to receive notifications and resumes its polling.&nbsp; The
  AS stores historical data and allows queries of this data, so it must store
the archive in a persistent database, rather than solely in memory. </p>
<p>All Grid Services have the ability to expose Service Data, which is a collection
  of XML elements encapsulated as Service Data Elements (SDE). The packaging
  of each SDE includes a name that is unique to the Grid Service instance, a
  type, and time-to-live information that a recipient can use for lifetime management.
  The obligatory Grid Service interface defines a standard WSDL operation, <strong>FIndServiceData</strong>,
  for querying and retrieving SDE, which is used by clients or other Grid Services. </p>
<p>In addition to having the ability to query any Grid Service for Service Data,
  <em>Grid Service A</em> may Subscribe to any SDE of <em>Grid
  Service B</em>, and receive Notifications
  (governed by certain timing and frequency constraints) whenever that SDE changes
  value.&nbsp; In this case, the entire SDE value is delivered with the Notification.</p>
<p>In GT3, the Index Service aggregates data received from multiple sources through
  registered subscriptions and via configured periodic query polling.&nbsp; The
  data in the Index Service represents &quot;current&quot; information, as delivered
  to it, limited of course by information latency and rapidity of change.&nbsp; The
  Index Service exposes this aggregated data through its Service Data interface,
  allowing other services and users, for example, to query for currently available
  and under-utilized grid resources. </p>
<p>At the highest level, this diagram conveys AS deployment options: </p>

<p>The AS has flexible mechanisms for data acquisition (subscription and polling)
  and for storage strategy. </p>
<p>While the AS has many similarities to the WS Index Service, especially concerning
  its acquisition and aggregation of data, the distinguishing characteristics
  of the AS is the storage of historic data in a persistent database. </p>
