<h1>Status and Plans for Globus Toolkit<sup>TM</sup> 4.0 </h1>
<p>Web services must often provide their users with the ability to access and manipulate state, i.e., data values that persist across, and evolve as a result of, Web service interactions. And while Web services successfully implement applications that manage state today, we need to define conventions for managing state so that applications discover, inspect, and interact with stateful resources in standard and interoperable ways. The <b>WS-Resource Framework</b> defines these conventions and does so within the context of established Web services standards.</p>
<p>This page includes release contents, schedule, and information on the new WS-RF specifications announced by IBM on January 20, 2004.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Initial work on the WS-Resource Framework has been performed by the Globus Alliance and IBM, who released initial architecture and specification documents with co-authors from HP, SAP, Akamai, TIBCO and Sonic (see below) for public comment and review on January 20, 2004. These documents will be submitted to an appropriate standards body in the near future.
<p>The WS-Resource Framework is inspired by the work of the Global Grid Forum's Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) Working Group. Indeed, it can be viewed as a straightforward refactoring of the concepts and interfaces developed in the OGSI V1.0 specification in a manner that exploits recent developments in Web services architecture (e.g., WS-Addressing). We discuss the relationship between the WS-Resource framework and OGSI in the document “From OGSI to WSRF: Refactoring and Extension.”
<h2>Release Schedule</h2>
<p>The following table outlines our current release schedule for GT 4.0. Please note that we are implementing a new version scheme beginning with this release (see <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/versioning.html%20for%20more%20info">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/versioning.html</a> for more info.)
