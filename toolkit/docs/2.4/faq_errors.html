      the connection to the server failed (check host and port) (error code 12)</code>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>Your client is unable to contact the gatekeeper specified. Possible causes
        include:
        </p>
<ol>
  <UL>
    <li>The gatekeeper is not running<BR>
    <li>The host is not reachable.<BR>
    <li>The gatekeeper is on a non-standard port<BR>
    </li>
  </UL>
</ol>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Make sure the gatekeeper is being launched by inetd or xinetd. Review <a href="admin/guide-startup.html#gram">the
        Admin Guide</a> if you do not know how to do this. Check to make sure
        that ordinary TCP/IP connections are possible; can you ssh to the host,
        or ping it? If you cannot, then you probably can't submit jobs either.
        Check for typos in the hostname.
</p>
  
  <p>Try telnetting to port 2119. If you see a "Unable to load shared library",
          the gatekeeper was not built statically, and does not have an appropriate
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH set. If that is the case, either rebuild it statically,
          or set the environment variable for the gatekeeper. In inetd, use /usr/bin/env
          to wrap the launch of the gatekeeper, or in xinetd, use the "env=" option. </p>

  <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log if it exists. It
          may tell you that the private key is insecure, so it refuses to start.
          In that case, fix the permissions of the key to be read only by the owner.
  </p>

  <p>If the gatekeeper is on a non-standard port, be sure to use a contact
          string of host:port.

    <h2 name=library>2. <a name="library"></a><code>error in loading shared libraries</code>
</h2>
    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is not set.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>If you receive this as a client, make sure to read in either $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
          (if you are using a Bourne-like shell) or $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh
          (if you are using a C-like shell)

<h2>3. <a name="noproxy"></a><code>ERROR: no valid proxy, or lifetime to small (one
            hour)</code>
</h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>You are running <code>globus-personal-gatekeeper</code> as root, or did
          not run <code>grid-proxy-init</code>.
        </p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Don't run <code>globus-personal-gatekeeper</code> as root. <code>globus-personal-gatekeeper</code> is
          designed to allow an ordinary user to establish a gatekeeper using a proxy
          from their personal certificate. If you are root, you should setup a gatekeeper
          using inetd or xinetd, and using your host certificates. If you are not
          root, make sure to run <code> grid-proxy-init</code> before starting the
          personal gatekeeper.

<h2>4. <a name="authentication"></a><code>GRAM Job submission failed because authentication
            with the remote server failed (error code 7)</code>
</h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log on the remote server.
          You will probably see something like:
        </p>
        <p><code>Authenticated globus user: /O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=your.domain/OU=Your
                    Name<BR>
          Failure: globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization. rc =1</code>
        </p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>This indicates that your account is not in the grid-mapfile. Create the
          grid-mapfile in /etc/grid-security (or wherever the -gridmap flag in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf
          points to) with an entry pairing your subject name to your user name. Review <a href="admin/guide-startup.html#gram">the
          Admin Guide</a> if
          you do not know how to do this.&nbsp; If you see &quot;rc = 7&quot;, you
          may have bad permissions on the /etc/grid-security/.&nbsp; It needs
          to be readable so that users can see the certificates/ subdirectory. </p>

<h2>5. <a name="valid"></a><code>GRAM Job submission failed bacause authentication
          failed: remote certificate not yet valid (error code 7)</code>
</h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>This indicates that the remote host has a date set greater than five minutes
          in the future relative to the remote host.
        </p>
        <p>Try typing "date -u" on both systems at the same time to verify this.
            (The "-u" specifies that the time should be displayed in universal
            time, also known as UTC or GMT.) </p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Ultimately, synchronize the hosts using NTP. Otherwise, unless you are
          willing to set the client host date back, you will have to wait until your
          system believes that the remote certificate is valid. Also, be sure to
          check your shell environment to see if you have any time zone variables
          set.

            failed: remote certificate has expired (error code 7)</code>
        </h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>This indicates that the remote host has an expired certificate. </p>
        <p>To double-check, you can use grid-cert-info or grid-proxy-info. Use
              grid-cert-info on /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem if you are dealing
              with a system level gatekeeper. Use grid-proxy-info if you are
        dealing with a personal gatekeeper. </p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>If the host certificate has expired, use grid-cert-renew to get a renewal.
          If your proxy has expired, create a new one with grid-proxy-init.

        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log on the remote server.
          You will probably see something like:

        <h2>8. <a name="expected"></a><code>GRAM Job submission failed because authentication
            failed: Expected target subject name="/CN=host/hostname"<br>
  Target returned subject name="/O=Grid/O=Globus/CN=hostname.domain.edu" (error
  code 7)</code>
        </h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>New installations will often see errors like the above where the expected
          target subject name has just the unqualified hostname but the target
        returned subject name has the fully qualified domain name (e.g. expected
        is "hostname" but
          returned is "hostname.domain.edu"). </p>
        <p>This is usually because the client looks up the target host's IP
          address in /etc/hosts and only gets the simple hostname back. </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The solution is to edit the /etc/hosts file so that it returns the fully
          qualified domain name. To do this find the line in /etc/hosts that has
          the target host listed and make sure it looks like:
        </p>
        <p><code>xx.xx.xx.xx hostname.domain.edu hostname</code> </p>
        <p>Where "xx.xx.xx.xx" should be the numeric IP address of the host and
            hostname.domain.edu should be replaced with the actual hostname in
        question. The trick is to make sure the full name (hostname.domain.edu)
        is listed before the nickname (hostname). </p>
        <p>If this only happens with your own host, see the explanation of the <a 
  href="#stdout">failed to open stdout</a> error,
              specifically about how to set the <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code> for
              your host. </p>

        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>You do not have a valid proxy.

          failed: remote side did not like my creds for unknown reason</code>
        </h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>Check the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log on the remote
        host. It probably says "remote certificate not yet valid". This indicates
        that the client host has a date set greater than five minutes in the
        future relative to the remote host. </p>
        <p>Try typing "date -u" on both systems at the same time to verify this.
            (The "-u" specifies that the time should be displayed in universal
            time, also known as UTC or GMT.) </p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Ultimately, synchronize the hosts using NTP. Otherwise, unless you are
          willing to set the client host date back, you will have to wait until the
          remote server believes that your proxy is valid. Also, be sure to check
          your shell environment to see if you have any time zone variables set.

        <h2>11. <a name="stdout"></a><code>GRAM Job submission failed because the job manager

        <h2><a name="stderr"></a><code>GRAM Job submission failed because the job manager
                      failed to open stderr (error code 74)</code></h2>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>The remote job manager is unable to open a connection back to your
        client host. Possible causes include:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bad results from globus-hostname. Try running globus-hostname
                    on your client. It should output the fully qualified domain name
                    of your host. This is the information which the GRAM client tools
                    use to let the jobmanager on the remote server know who to open
                    a connection to. If it does not give a fully qualified domain name,
                    the remote host may be unable to open a connection back to your
                  host. </li>
          <li>A firewall. If a firewall blocks the jobmanager's attempted connection
          back to your host, this error will result. </li>
          <li>Troubles in the ~/.globus/.gass_cache on the remote host. This
                                  is the least frequent cause of this error.
          It could relate to NFS or AFS issues on the remote host. </li>
          <li>It is also possible that the CA that issued your Globus certificate
                                  is not trusted by your local host. Running
          'grid-proxy-init -verify' should detect this situation. </li>
        </ul>
<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Depending on the cause from above, try the following solutions:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fix the result of 'hostname' itself. You can accomplish this
                    by editing /etc/hosts and adding the fully qualified domain name
                    of your host to this file. See how to do this in the explanation
                    of the <a 
    href="#expected">expected target
                              subject</a> error. If you cannot do this, or do not want to do this,
                              you can set the <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code> environment variable
                              to override the result of globus-hostname. Set <code>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</code> to
                              the fully qualified domain name of your host.
          </li>
          <li>To cope with a firewall, use the <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> environment
                                  variable. If your host is behind a firewall,
            set <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> to
                                  the allowable incoming connections on your
            firewall. If the firewall is in front of the remote server, you
                                  will need the remote site to set <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> in
                                  the gatekeeper's environment to the allowable
                                  incoming range of the firewall in front of
                                  the remote server. If there are firewalls on
                                  both sides, perform both of the above steps.
                                  Note that the allowable ranges do not need
                                  to coincide on the two firewalls; it is, however,
                                  necessary that the <code>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</code> be
                                  valid for both incoming and outgoing connections
          of the firewall it is set for. </li>
          <li>If you are working with AFS, you will want the .gass_cache directory
                                  to be a link to a local filesystem. If you
            are having NFS trouble, you will need to fix it, which is beyond
          the scope of this document. </li>

          string includes variables that could not be identified (error code 39)</code>
        </h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>You submitted a job which specifies an RSL substitution which the remote
          jobmanager does not recognize. The most common case is using a 2.0 version
          of globus-job-get-output with a 1.1.x gatekeeper/jobmanager.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Currently, globus-job-get-output will not work between a 2.0 client and
          a 1.1.x gatekeeper. Work is in progress to ensure interoperability by the
          final release. In the meantime, you should be able to modify the globus-job-get-output
          script to use $(GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH) instead of $(GLOBUS_LOCATION).

          not in /etc/shells)</code>
        </h2>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>The 530 Login incorrect usually indicates that your account is not in the
          grid-mapfile, or that your shell is not in /etc/shells.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>If your account is not in the grid-mapfile, make sure to get it added.
          If it is in the grid-mapfile, check the syslog on the machine, and you
          may see the /etc/shells message. If that is the case, make sure that your
          shell (as listed in finger or chsh) is in the list of approved shells in
          /etc/shells.

<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Either use a certificate from a different CA or contact the administer

        <p>You need to ask the resource administrator which CA issued their certificate

<h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Do not install the replica bundle into a GLOBUS_LOCATION containing
            other Information Services. The Replica Catalog is also deprecated -
            use RLS instead.
