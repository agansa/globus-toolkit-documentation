    <p>The Globus Resource
    Specification Language (RSL) provides a common interchange language to describe resources.
    The various components of the Globus Resource Management architecture manipulate RSL
    strings to perform their management functions in cooperation with the other components in
    the system. The RSL provides the skeletal syntax used to compose complicated resource
    descriptions, and the various resource management components introduce specific &lt;<i>attribute</i>,&nbsp;<i>value</i>&gt;
    pairings into this common structure. Each attribute in a resource description serves as a
    parameter to control the behavior of one or more components in the resource management
    system. </p>

      <p><a name="RSL Syntax Overview"><strong>RSL Syntax Overview</strong></a></p>
    <p>The core syntax of the RSL syntax is the <i>relation</i>. Relations associate an
    attribute name with a value, eg the relation ``<tt>executable=a.out</tt>'' provides the
    name of an executable in a resource request. There are two generative syntactic structures
    in the RSL that are used to build more complicated resource descriptions out of the basic
    relations: <i>compound requests</i> and <i>value sequences</i>. In addition, the RSL
    syntax includes a facility to both introduce and dereference string <i>variables</i>. </p>
    <p>The simplest form of compound request, utilized by all resource management components,
    is the conjunct-request. The conjuct-request expresses a conjunction of simple relations
    or compound requests (like a boolean AND). The most common conjunct-request in Globus RSL
    strings is the combination of multiple relations such as executable name, node count,
    executable arguments, and output files for a basic GRAM job request. Similarly, the core
    RSL syntax includes a disjunct-request form to represent disjunctive relations (like a
    boolean OR). Currently, however, no resource management component utilizes the
    disjunct-request form. </p>
    <p>The last form of compound request is the multi-request. Multi-requests are used by
    DUROC, the coallocation component of the resource management system, to specify multiple
    parallel resources that make up a resource description. The multi-request form differs
    from the conjunction and disjunction in two ways: multi-requests introduce new variable
    scope, meaning variables defined in one clause of a multi-request are not visible to the
    other clauses, and multi-requests introduce a non-reducible hierarchy to the resource
    description. Whereas relations within a conjunct-request can be thought of as
    ``constraints'' on the resource being described, the subclauses of a multi-request are
    best thought of as individual resource descriptions that together constitute an abstract
    resource collection; the same attributes may be ``constrained'' in different ways in each
    subclause without causing a logical contradiction. An example of a contradiction would be
    to constrain the ``<tt>executable</tt>'' attribute to be two conflicting values within a
    conjunction. </p>
    <p>The simplest form of value in the RSL syntax is the string literal. When explicitly
    quoted, literals can contain any character, and many common literals that don't contain
    special characters can appear without quotes. Values can also be variable references, in
    which case the variable reference is in essence <strong>replaced</strong> with the string
    value defined for that variable. RSL descriptions can also express string-concatenation of
    values, especially useful to construct long strings out of several variable references.
    String concatenation is supported with both an explicit concatenation operator and
    implicit concatenation for many idiomatic constructions involving variable references and
    literals. </p>
    <p>In addition to the simple value forms given above, the RSL syntax includes the value
    sequence to express ordered sets of values. The value sequence syntax is used primarily
    for defining variables and for providing the argument list for a program. </p>
    <p><a name="RSL Tokenization Overview"><strong>RSL Tokenization Overview</strong></a></p>
    <p>Each RSL string consists of a sequence of RSL tokens, whitespace, and comments. The RSL
    tokens are either special syntax or regular unquoted literals, where special syntax
    contains one or more of the following listed special characters and unquoted literals are
    made of sequences of characters excluding the special characters. </p>
    <p>The complete set of special characters that cannot appear as part of an unquoted
    literal is: `<tt>+</tt>'&nbsp;(plus), `<tt>&amp;</tt>'&nbsp;(ampersand), `<tt>|</tt>'&nbsp;(pipe),
    `<tt>(</tt>'&nbsp;(left&nbsp;paren), `<tt>)</tt>'&nbsp;(right&nbsp;paren), `<tt>=</tt>'&nbsp;(equal),
    `<tt>&lt;</tt>'&nbsp;(left&nbsp;angle), `<tt>&gt;</tt>'&nbsp;(right&nbsp;angle), `<tt>!</tt>'&nbsp;(exclamation),
    `<tt>&quot;</tt>'&nbsp;(double&nbsp;quote), `<tt>'</tt>'&nbsp;(apostrophe), `<tt>^</tt>'&nbsp;(carat),
    `<tt>#</tt>'&nbsp;(pound), and `<tt>$</tt>'&nbsp;(dollar). These characters can only be
    used for the special syntactic forms described in the above <a href="#RSL Syntax Overview">RSL&nbsp;syntax&nbsp;overview</a>
    and in the <a href="#RSL grammar and tokenization rules">RSL&nbsp;grammar</a> provided
    below, or as within quoted literals. </p>
    <p>Quoted literals are introduced with the `<tt>&quot;</tt>'&nbsp;(double&nbsp;quote) or `<tt>'</tt>'&nbsp;(single&nbsp;quote/apostrophe)
    and consist of all the characters up to (but not including) the next solo double or single
    quote, respectively. To escape a quote character within a quoted literal, the appearance
    of the quote character twice in a row is converted to a single instance of the character
    and the literal continues until the next solo quote character. For any quoted literal,
    there is only one possible escape sequence, eg within a literal delimited by the single
    quote character only the single quote character uses the escape notation and the double
    quote character can appear without escape. </p>
    <p>Quoted literals can also be introduced with an alternate <i>user&nbsp;delimiter</i>
    notation. User delimited literals are introduced with the `<tt>^</tt>'&nbsp;(carat)
    character followed immediately by a user-provided delimiter; the literal consists of all
    the characters after the user's delimiter up to (but not including) the next solo instance
    of the delimiter. The delimiter itself may be escaped within the literal by providing two
    instances in a row, just as the regular quote delimiters are escaped in regular quoted
    literals. </p>
    <p>RSL string comments use a notation similar to comments in the C programming language.
    Comments are introduced by the prefix `<tt>(*</tt>'. Comments continue to the first
    terminating suffix `<tt>*)</tt>' and cannot be nested. Comments are stripped from the RSL
    string during processing and are syntactically equivalent to whitespace. </p>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="RSL Substitution Semantics"><strong>RSL Substitution Semantics</strong></a></p>
    <p>RSL strings can introduce and reference string variables. String substitution variables
    are defined in a special relation using the &quot;rsl_substitution'' attribute, and the
    definitions affect variable references made in the same conjunct-request (or
    disjunct-request), as well as references made within any multi-request nested inside one
    of the clauses of the conjunction (or disjunction). Each multi-request introduces a new
    variable scope for each subrequest, and variable definitions do not escape the closest
    enclosing scope. </p>
    <p>Within any given scope, variable definitions are processed left-to-right in the
    resource description. Outermost scopes are processed before inner scopes, and the
    definitions in inner scopes augment the inherited definitions with new and/or updated
    variable definitions. </p>
    <p>Variable definitions and variable references are processed in a single pass, with each
    definition updating the <i>environment</i> prior to processing the next definition. The
    value provided in a variable definition may include a reference to a previously-defined
    variable. References to variables that are not yet provided with definitions in the
    standard RSL variable processing order are replaced with an empty literal string. </p>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="RSL Attribute Summary"><strong>RSL Attribute Summary</strong></a></p>
    <p>The RSL syntax is extensible because it defines structure without too many keywords.
    Each Globus resource management component introduces additional attributes to the set
    recognized by RSL-aware components, so it is difficult to provide a complete listing of
    attributes which might appear in a resource description. Resource management components
    are designed to utilize attributes they recognize and pass unrecongnized relations through
    unchanged. This allows powerful compositions of different resource management functions. </p>
    <p>The following listing summarizes the attribute names utilized by existing resource
    management components in the standard Globus release. Please see the individual component
    documentation for discussion of the attribute semantics. </p>

    <p><a name="Simple RSL Examples"><strong>Simple RSL Examples</strong></a></p>
    <p>The following are some simple example RSL strings to illustrate idiomatic usage with
    existing tools and to make concrete some of the more interesting cases of tokenization,
    concatenation, and variable semantics. These are meant to illustrate the use of the RSL
    notation without much regard for the specific details of a particular resource management
    component. </p>
    <p>Typical GRAM resource descriptions contain at least a few relations in a conjunction: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(* this is a comment *)
&amp; (executable = a.out (* &lt;-- that is an unquoted literal *))
  (directory  = /home/nobody )
  (arguments  = arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot;)
  (count = 1)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Substitutions can be used to make sure the same substring is used multiple times in a
    resource description: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&amp; (rsl_substitution  = (TOPDIR  &quot;/home/nobody&quot;)
                (DATADIR $(TOPDIR)&quot;/data&quot;) 
                (EXECDIR $(TOPDIR)/bin) )
  (executable = $(EXECDIR)/a.out
        (* ^-- implicit concatenation *))
  (directory  = $(TOPDIR) )
  (arguments  = $(DATADIR)/file1 
        (* ^-- implicit concatenation *)
                $(DATADIR) # /file2
        (* ^-- explicit concatenation *)
                '$(FOO)'            (* &lt;-- a quoted literal *))
  (environment = (DATADIR $(DATADIR)))
  (count = 1)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Performing all variable substitution and removing comments yields an equivalent RSL
    string: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&amp; (rsl_substitution  = (TOPDIR  &quot;/home/nobody&quot;)
                (DATADIR &quot;/home/nobody/data&quot;) 
                (EXECDIR &quot;/home/nobody/bin&quot;) )
  (executable = &quot;/home/nobody/bin/a.out&quot; )
  (directory  = &quot;/home/nobody&quot; )
  (arguments  = &quot;/home/nobody/data/file1&quot;
                &quot;/home/nobody/data/file2&quot;
                &quot;$(FOO)&quot; )
  (environment = (DATADIR &quot;/home/nobody/data&quot;))
  (count = 1)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note in the above variable-substitution example, the variable substitution definitions
    are not automatically made a part of the job's environment.&nbsp; And explicit
    &quot;environment&quot; attribute must be used to add environment variables for the job.
    Also note that the third value in the arguments clause is not a variable reference but
    only quoted literal that happens to contain one of the special characters. </p>
    <p><a name="RSL grammar and tokenization rules"><strong>RSL grammar and tokenization rules</strong></a></p>
    <p>The following is a modified BNF grammar for the Resource Specification Language.
    Terminals appear in single quotes, eg `<tt>terminal</tt>'. Lexical rules are provided for
    the implicit concatenation sequences in the form of conventional regular expressions; for
    the ``implicit-concat'' non-terminal rules, whitespace is not allowed between juxtaposed
    non-terminals. Grammar comments are provided in square brackets in a column to the right
    of the productions, eg [comment] to help relate productions in the grammar to the
    terminology used in the above discussion. </p>
    <p>Regular expressions are provided for the terminal class ``string-literal'' and for RSL
    comments. These regular expression make use of a common inverted character-class notation,
    as popularized by the various <tt>lex</tt> tools. Comments are syntactically equivalent to
    whitespace and can only appear where the comment prefix cannot be mistaken for the
    trailing part of a multi-character unquoted literal.</p>
