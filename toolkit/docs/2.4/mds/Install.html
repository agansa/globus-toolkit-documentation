<p>Installation and 
configuration of the MDS 2.4 release requires the following basic steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Install MDS as directed by the Globus Toolkit 
  2.4 Installation Instructions.</li>
  <li>Obtain required certificate(s).</li>
  <li>Start MDS.</li>
  <li>Send a test query to GRIS and GIIS.</li>
  <li>Set up and test MDS for authenticated access.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are 
described in detail in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p><b>1. 
    Install MDS as directed by the 
<a href="../admin/">Globus Toolkit 2.4 Installation Instructions</a>. </b></p>
<p>MDS 2.4 is  included with the Globus Toolkit 2.4 release. 
    Therefore, MDS should be installed as described in the
        
  <i>
    

    
  <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.4 
  Installation Instructions</a></i>. 
    These instructions describe how to get and install the Globus Toolkit
    2.4  release.</p>
<p><b>2. Obtain required 
certificate(s).</b></p>
<p>For authenticated 
    access to MDS, each user needs a user certificate and corresponding key, and 
    the server requires an LDAP service certificate and corresponding key.&nbsp; 
See Step 5 below regarding authenticated access.</p>
<p>As described in the
  <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.4 Installation
  Instructions</a>, you obtain a user 
certificate with the grid-cert-request command. </p>
<p>To obtain the LDAP 
    service certificate required by MDS, you also use the grid-cert-request 
    command, as described in the
  <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">
MDS 2.4 User’s Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Only anonymous bind 
    works without the service certificate. You can install the certificate later, 
restart the service, and then test with authentication.</p>
<p>The LDAP service 
    certificate is located by MDS based on the GSI installation and 
configuration.</p>
<p>The service certificate 
    and key are set by default in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-info-server-env.conf 
    to $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem and ldapkey.pem.&nbsp; 
  These files should have permissions 600 and should be 
  owned by the user account running MDS. If 
  MDS cannot read these files for some reason, it will try instead $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ldap/ldapcert.pem 
and ldapkey.pem.</p>
<p><b>3. Start MDS.</b></p>
<p>When 
    you are logged in as the user account that will run MDS,  start MDS 2.4 with the 
following command:</p>
<pre>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-mds  start</pre>
<p>This command calls the 
    grid-info-slapd script, which calls grid-info-server-env.conf.&nbsp; As mentioned
     above, that configuration file sets up the MDS environment variables such
    as  those for the service certificate and key. This grid-info-slapd script
    then  calls the slapd server, which reads the grid-info-slapd.conf file and
     determines all the other configuration files to read.&nbsp; Refer to
  <a href="Config.html">
MDS 2.4 Configuration Files</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The globus-mds start 
command does not require the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable if you put the full path in as shown above.</p>
<p>Note that for 
    compatibility with MDS 2.1, the SXXgris start command continues to work in 
MDS 2.4.</p>
<p><b>
4. Send a test query to GRIS and GIIS.</b></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  Send a test query to the GRIS on a local host, with the 
following command:</p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/grid-info-search -anonymous</pre>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  <b>5. Set up and test MDS 
for authenticated access.</b></p>
    <p>To be able to perform authenticated 
    queries, you need to set up MDS as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Set the environment.<br>
        <br>
        Set GLOBUS_LOCATION to the location of your 
        Toolkit installation.&nbsp; Then source your environment corresponding to 
          the type of shell you are using.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p>Obtain necessary certificates.<br>
        <br>
        You need a user certificate and the server requires an LDAP service 
        certificate.&nbsp; You obtain these certificates with the
          grid-cert-request command.&nbsp; See Step 2 above.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p>Obtain a proxy for 
          authenticated access.<br>
        <br>
        You obtain a proxy with the
        grid-proxy-init command.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p>Start MDS and verify authenticated access.<br>
        <br>
        Start MDS as described in Step 3 above, then enter the following 
        security-enabled query to output the details of all objects on the GRIS:<br>
        <br>
        grid-info-search -b &quot;mds-vo-name=local, 
    o=grid&quot;</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Refer to the <i>
    <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS
    2.4 User’s Guide</a></i> (the <i>MDS 
          Security Setup Procedures</i> section of Chapter 5, <i>MDS Security
           Configuration</i>) for more details on the above procedures.</p>
