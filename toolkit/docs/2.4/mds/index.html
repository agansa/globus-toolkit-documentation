        		The Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS) is 
        the information services component of the Globus Toolkit. The MDS 2.4 
        release includes fixes and
        <a href="NewFeatures.html">
        enhancements</a> for scalability, 
        reliability, and stability.</p>
        <p>Note 
        that MDS 2.4 includes all of the features and functionality of MDS 2.2, 
        which continue to be documented as shown below.</p>
        <h2>MDS 2.2 Features in the Globus 
        Toolkit 2.2 Release </h2>
        <p>The MDS 2.2 release includes significant fixes and
        <a href="../../2.2/mds/NewFeatures.html">
        enhancements</a> that make for a considerably more robust MDS with 
        expanded capabilities for dealing with problematic installations.</p>
        <p>Note that the 
        documents listed under &quot;Documentation for MDS 2.4&quot; may also
        describe MDS 2.2.&nbsp; MDS
        2.1 documents describing functionality that remains separate and distinct
         from that in MDS 2.2 are now archived on
        <a href="../../2.0/mds/">
        MDS 2.1 Features in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Release</a>.&nbsp; Otherwise,
        MDS  2.1 features and functions carried over into MDS 2.2 are described
        in  the documents listed below.</p>
        <p>
        A 
        <a href="getmdsdata/vo-index.html">public vo-index GIIS</a> is now available.

<h2>Security Notice for MDS 2.4 in the Globus Toolkit 4.0 Release </h2>
        <p>Please note that in 
		the GT4 pre-WS build, MDS2 is not installed by default. This is because of security concerns with two third-party
		libraries, Open LDAP v.2.0.22 and Cyrus SASL (v. 1.5.27). That 
		version of OpenLDAP has security vulnerabilities that are no longer
		being patched due to the age of the version (the current version is
		2.2.25). This means that anyone who runs MDS2 on their server has a
		chance of being affected by this, although we have no reported cases
		of this occurring. A similar situation exists for the version of Cyrus
		SASL we are using although this can be avoided by not using MDS2 in secure-mode.</p>
		<p>An unsupported, minimally-tested version of MDS2 based on more recent, 
		more secure versions of OpenLDAP and Cyrus SASL is available for 
		download at [link]; however, we strongly recommend that any MDS2 users 
		upgrade their system to use the new WSRF-based MDS4, and we will be 
		happy to work with you to make this possible for your project. Please 
		note that in GT4, MDS2 is a depreciated component, which means that it 
		will not be included in the GT4.2 release, nor supported once GT4.4 
		exists.</p>
		<h2>Documentation for MDS 2.4</h2>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following documentation applies to MDS2 in GT versions 2.2 through
		  4.0. In versions of Globus Toolkit 3.0 and above, MDS2 is also referred
		  to as Pre-Web Services MDS (Pre-WS MDS):
