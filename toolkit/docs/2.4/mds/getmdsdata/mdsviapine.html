	<p>Many e-mail clients provide a means to access an LDAP directory. Since MDS 
    uses OpenLDAP to contain Grid resource information, you can access MDS data 
    from within these mail clients.</p>
    
    <p>The practical application of doing this may be suspect, but the purpose here 
    is to demonstrate the broad range of options available for consuming and 
    making use of the Grid resource information.</p>
