<p><b><a name="multiplecerts">Q: How does one generate multiple gatekeeper and user
certificates as well as a few&nbsp;LDAP service certificates?</a></b></p>

<p>Write a wrapper script around <code>grid-cert-request</code>, 
to generate a key and a certificate request  (each pair per machine/user can be specified in
a separate file). Then  mail each request separately to the
<code>ca@globus.org</code>. This makes it easy for the
Globus Certificate Authority (CA) to issue certificates and do bookkeeping without too much additional effort.

<p>
 Look at the command line options in grid-cert-request given below:

<p><a name="ldapcert"><b>Q: How do I generate and where do I install the LDAP  service
certificate?&nbsp;
 Also how do I distinguish between the gatekeeper certificate and LDAP
certificate?</b></a></p>
 
    <p>For authenticated access to MDS, each Globus Toolkit user requires a user certificate 
    and each server requires an LDAP service certificate.
    These certificates allow the user and the server, respectively, to 
    participate in the authentication process.&nbsp;(Each 
    host requires a host certificate if it is running a gatekeeper or other 
    service besides MDS.)</p>
    <p>As described in the <i>
    <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.4
    Installation Instructions</a></i>, you obtain a user,
    host, or service certificate with the
    grid-cert-request 
    command.&nbsp;For your user certificate, you issue this command from the
    client  machine. For the LDAP service certificate required by MDS, 
    you issue this command from the server machine in the following form: </p>
    <p>
    % 
    grid-cert-request –service ldap –host my.host.fqdn</p>
    <p>In the command format above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p><code>
      -service ldap </code>specifies that a certificate be created for 
      the LDAP server.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p><code>
      -host 
      my.host.fqdn </code>specifies the fully qualified domain name of 
      the host that will run the LDAP server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a description of all the options available for
    grid-cert-request, 
    enter the command with the
    –help or
    –usage 
    options.</p>
    <p>After running this command, the 
    service key is generated 
    immediately and placed in /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapkey.pem.&nbsp;The key file 
    should be readable only by its owner. The certificate 
    request is stored in /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert_request.pem.</p>

    <p>After you enter the 
    grid-cert-request command for the LDAP service certificate, do the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
    <p>Use your regular user mail agent to 
    send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ca@globus.org">ca@globus.org</a>; copy and 
    paste the contents of /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert_request.pem into the 
    message. Do not include this file as an attachment. Do not be concerned 
    about the 0 byte file named ldapcert.pem that is generated by the grid-cert-request 
    program. It is just a place holder; your real certificate will arrive in the 
    mail.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
    <p>Within two business days, your LDAP 
    service 
    certificate will be mailed to you. When it arrives, read the contents of the 
    e-mail and save the entire e-mail to /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem. 
    This file must be owned by the user account that will run MDS. The file 
    should have permissions 600.</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the Globus CA mentioned 
    above is provided for convenience only. For the most effective security, 
    your environment should have its own CA.</p>

    <p>Refer to the <i>
    <a href="../install.html">Globus Toolkit 2.4
     Installation Instructions</a></i> for more details on e-mailing your 
    certificate request and receiving your certificate via return e-mail.</p>

    <hr>

<p><a name="mdssecuritymodel"><b>Q: What is the security model
for MDS 2.4?</b></a></p>

<p>MDS 2.4 uses 

      OpenLDAP, which is based on LDAPv3. The security in
OpenLDAP (as
of version 2.0) is
provided by SASL, which uses GSSAPI.</p>
<p>      GSSAPI is a convenient generic interface for secure application development.
By itself, GSSAPI does not provide any security. It relies on underlying technologies to provide the actual identity authentication and message
protection services desired by applications communicating over a network. Such a security technology is called a GSSAPI security mechanism.
Applications may install and request the use of particular mechanisms or use a default mechanism provided by the GSSAPI implementation.</p>

<p>      The GSSAPI security mechanism developed for MDS 2.4 is GSI, which
enables the use of Globus certificates and grid-mapfiles to provide
authorization services to information objects. MDS 2.4 also 
supports the OpenLDAP access control features, as described in the <i>
<a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin20/">OpenLDAP 2.0 Administrator's 
Guide</a></i>.</p>

<p>      A security mechanism is identified by a globally unique Object Identifier
(OID). For example, the OID for GSI is 1.3.6.1.4.1.3536.1.1.</p>

<p>      The main security enhancement to LDAPv3 (in comparison to LDAPv2) is that new authentication mechanisms have been added to the bind
operation: password protection using a hash function, and certificate-based digitally
signed token. These are fully compatible with the definitions found in X.509, so that an LDAP to X.500 gateway can pass them directly to the      X.500 server. The protocol is extensible to allow for
privately defined or future additional authentication      mechanisms, including challenge-response and multi-stage binds, and the server can return credentials to the      client.<br>
<br>
      A problem with LDAPv2 deployment was that the string syntaxes for certificates and certificate revocation lists
(CRLs) were not reversible, and that it was not always possible to obtain the DER binary encoding of values
with      these syntaxes in order to be able verify signatures. In contrast, LDAPv3
clients can request to receive CRLs,      certificates and distinguished names in binary (DER encoded ASN.1) form, which eliminates the ambiguity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="rootaccess"><b>Q: Do I need root access to install and run MDS
2.4?</b></a></p>

<p>No, but if you want to set up MDS 2.4 to automatically start
up at system boot time, you do need root access. This can be requested of system staff.</p>


<hr>

    <p><b><a name="runasroot">Q:&nbsp;Do you recommend running MDS 
    2.4 as root?</a></b></p>
    <p>No, for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Under UNIX, programs should not be run as root unless 
      required.&nbsp; There is no reason that MDS needs to run as root.</li>
      <li>
      <p>MDS uses OpenLDAP, and security holes have been 
      identified therein.&nbsp; Although we at the Globus Project patch OpenLDAP 
      accordingly when we find out about these security holes, running MDS as 
      root would make them much more dangerous.</li>
      <li>
      <p>MDS itself might have buffer overflow problems that 
      could cause it to start arbitrary sub-processes, and not running MDS as 
      root mitigates this danger.</li>
      <li>
      <p>Once MDS is installed, the grid-info-resource-ldif.conf 
      configuration file (see <i>
      <a href="Config.html">MDS 2.4 Configuration
       Files</a></i>) identifies information providers by their path.&nbsp; MDS
        runs these as sub-processes, and there is no reason for an information
        provider to run as root.&nbsp;If such a requirement existed, the information
         provider could be made setuid on its own.&nbsp;This could open backdoors
         for  hackers.
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Overall, there are only a very few pieces of the 
      Globus Toolkit that need to have root access.&nbsp;The rest should just be run 
      as an ordinary non-privileged user.</li>
    </ul>

<p><a name="bindlocalerror"><b>Q: I have everything up and running, but when I try to do a 
grid-info-search I get an error message:</b></a></p>



<blockquote>ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: local error</blockquote>

<p><strong>
What's wrong?
</strong></p>

 
<p>In MDS 2.4, clients perform a GSI-GSSAPI bind to the MDS server. 
The error message seen above occurs if the client does not have a valid proxy, or: <code><pre>$ grid-info-search -h 1linux -p 2167 -s sub -b &quot;o=Grid&quot; &quot;objectclass=*&quot;

SASL/GSSAPI authentication started

ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error
</pre></code>

<p>If the &quot;-x&quot; option is used, we get the following:</p>

	<code><pre>$ grid-info-search -h 1linux -p 2167 -s sub -b &quot;o-Grid&quot; &quot;objectclass=*&quot; -x

version:2

#
# Filter: objectclass=*
# requesting: ALL
#

# search result
search: 2
result: 53 DSA is unwilling to perform
text: access denied: gridmap lookup failed

# numResponses: 1
</pre></code>

<p>This occurs whether we turn anonymous bind on or off, and whether we have run
grid-proxy-init or not. Also, the grid-mapfile, owned by root, contains:</p>

	<code><pre>&quot;/C=US/O=UNIV/L=COMP/CN=John Doe/Email=john.doe@comp.univ.edu&quot;
globus</pre></code>

<p>In the file 
/opt/globus-mds/share/certificates/ca-signing-policy.conf, 
both Globus and the UNIV CA appear.</p>

<p><b>What could the problem be?</b></p>



<p>The failure is happening at 'bind' time; the check on grid-mapfile occurs at the
back end, after the bind goes through.</p>

<p>The grid-mapfile should include the user's DN and their 
local account name. The grid-mapfile should contain entries for users only. 

<p>The server account does
not need to do a grid-proxy-init. 
In fact, make sure that there isn't an old
proxy in /tmp that belongs to 
globus. 

<p>
Regular user accounts need to have a valid proxy, 
which can be obtained using grid-proxy-init. 

<p>
To check if a proxy is still valid, use
grid-proxy-info. 
Make sure that the user's X509_USER_PROXY
 is pointing to a valid proxy.</p>

        <code><b>
<a name="gridcertrequestsamemachine">Q: Do I need to run grid-cert-request on 
the same machine as MDS 2.4?</a></b></code><p><code>
    No. The syntax for 
    grid-cert-request is:</code><code><pre>grid-cert-request -service ldap -host &lt;FQDN&gt; -dir &lt;dir_name&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>
This can be executed anywhere, on any machine. The <code>-dir</code> 
can be local to that
machine, or on an accessible remote machine. Once received, the certificate 
and key can
be moved to a new location. The <code>FQDN</code> must be the
fully qualified domain
name of the machine on which the MDS 2.4 server will be running.
The certificate
authority does not require that the certificate request for machine A must come from machine A.</p>

  <a name="anonymousqueriesonly">
  Q: I downloaded the Globus Toolkit 2.4 release and installed MDS.&nbsp;
  All of the installation was successful.<br>
  <br>
  I applied the LDAP server certification, and I put 
  ldapcert.pem and
  ldapkey.pem in  /etc/grid-security/ldap.<br>
  <br>
  Then I started MDS with the globus-mds start
  (formerly SXXgris start) command.<br>
  <br>
  I could do anonymous (anonymous flag set; without SASL) queries, as
  follows:<br>
  <br>
  grid-info-search -x -b &quot;mds-vo-name=local, o=grid&quot;<br>
  grid-info-search -x -b &quot;mds-vo-name=site, o=grid&quot;<br>
  <br>
  But I could not do security-enabled (with SASL) queries, as follows:<br>
  <br>
  % grid-info-search -b &quot;mds-vo-name=local, o=grid&quot;
  ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such attribute</a> </b><br>
  <br>
  If anonymous queries work but authenticated queries do not, it means the server
  is
  up and running.<br>
  <br>
  The problem could be that the wrong server port is being used, i.e., the
  port is not set up for authentication, or that there are no certificates
  in the certificate directory.<br>
  <br>
  First, make sure the client has a valid proxy to start with, and second,
  that the server certificate permission is correct.&nbsp;The key is probably not world-readable or writable.&nbsp;You can look into /etc/grid-security/ldap/.<br>
  <br>
  If all seems to be correct, try queries like:<br>
  <br>

  grid-info-search -x&nbsp; -s base -h
        their-host -p their-port -b &quot;&quot; supportedsaslmechanisms<br>
  <br>
  on the server to see if the mechanism is correct.<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes, it might be because 

  SASL_PATH
  is not set properly, so client and server cannot find the SASL plug-ins.&nbsp;
  If you put -d 255 on the 
  grid-info-search
  query, it will give a lot more debugging information and can eliminate some other
missteps.</p>

I’ve made configuration changes to my MDS setup, but they do not take effect when I start MDS.</b></a></p>
<p>
You or someone else may have a slapd server from a previous startup of MDS already running on the system, preventing a new slapd from starting.  For example, you and another user may both be trying to run slapd servers on the same port.  Or there may be a slapd running from a previous version or installation of MDS.</p>
<p>        This situation may also cause the slapd server to not start at all
        when you enter the
  
    globus-mds start (formerly
  
    SXXgris
 start)
 command to invoke MDS.  However, there may be other reasons for the slapd
        server not starting, such as not setting or sourcing your environment,
        not having the right certificates, and so forth. Refer to the <i>
   <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf"> MDS 2.4 User’s
   Guide</a></i> for
more information on those topics.</p>
<p>        Check your environment for the slapd servers that are currently running.
        To see which slapd servers are currently running on Linux, enter the
following command:</p>
<pre>        % ps uawx | grep slapd</pre>
<p>        From the output of this command, you can see if any old or conflicting
        slapd servers are running, and you can remove them as appropriate with
the kill command.</p>
<p>        Note that the globus-mds stop (formerly 
        SXXgris stop) command may not kill the slapd instance you had intended.
        Use the kill command instead.
        globus-mds stop is appropriate for when you want to stop MDS, make
        a configuration change, and restart MDS via globus-mds start, assuming
there are no conflicting slapd servers running at that point in time. </p>

  <br>
  Since MDS uses OpenLDAP as its front-end query engine, 
  you can take advantage of all the industry standard and community driven 
  software designed to work with LDAP servers. This includes a number of 
  software packages created to expose LDAP server data via an html/http 
  interface. The following are two examples:<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://ldapweb.sourceforge.net/">http://ldapweb.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
  <br>
  This is an LDAP web interface developed using Apache, PHP, and SSL tools.  It can be used to manipulate Microsoft's Active Directory.  It provides search, add, delete, and modify capabilities, as well as schema recognition.<br>

  <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ldapwebxplorer/?topic_id=90">http://freshmeat.net/projects/ldapwebxplorer/?topic_id=90</a><br>

  This is a PHP-based LDAP web interface.  It provides browse, edit, delete, search, and authentication capabilities.  It has some multilingual capabilities, a friendly interface, and an extendable configuration.

In the globus-mds (formerly SXXgris) file in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin, there is a call to grid-info-soft-register, with a parameter "-d 0".  You can change this to, for example, “-d 255” to get lots of debugging information.</p>

  You can also use the Unix syslog

  You put an entry like:<br>
  <br>
  local4.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local-log-file<br>

  <a name="hostnameresolution">Q: I’m trying to set up Globus Toolkit 2.4. 
      Everything seems to be working, except I can only do anonymous MDS 
      searches. If I enter grid-info-search without the “-x” option, I get this 
      output:<br>
  <br>
  SASL/GSI-GSSAPI authentication started<br>
  ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error<br>
  <br>
  I think I have everything set up correctly: the ldapcert.pem and 
  ldapkey.pem files are in /etc/grid-security/ldap, the grid-mapfile is in 
  /etc/grid-security, the usercert.pem and userkey.pem files are in $HOME/.globus, 
  and all the environment variables that I can see are pointing to the right 
  locations (including SASL_PATH). Remote jobs run fine, as do anonymous MDS 
  queries.</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Assuming everything else is in fact set up properly, the problem may have 
  to do with how the host names of the machines are being reported. When a 
  host name is looked up on a machine without that host name in its 
  /etc/hosts file, it is looked up through DNS and hopefully returns the correct 
  result. If the machine does have a host name in its /etc/hosts file but 
  the host name is not in fully qualified format, or is in that format but 
  does not appear first on the line referencing it, it fails to resolve 
  correctly and the Globus Toolkit is not able to authenticate its 
  certificate.<br>
  <br>
  For example, a hosts file appearing like this will not allow authenticated 
  access because the fully qualified name appears second on each line:<br>
  <br>
  122.0.0.1 host01 host01.univ.edu localhost<br>
  125.213.49.87 host01 host01.univ.edu<br>
  <br>
  A hosts file appearing like this will allow authenticated access because 
  the fully qualified name appears first on each line:<br>
  <br>
  122.0.0.1 host01.univ.edu host01 localhost<br>
  125.213.49.87 host01.univ.edu host01<br>

  authentication problem, refer to the other FAQs on this issue: <br>

<p>There are several things you can try, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can Host2 ping Host1 (without its qualified name), and vice versa?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If the hosts can ping each other, then try the following 
          grid-info-search queries, both anonymous (-x option) and

    <br>
    - From Host2 to Host2<br>

    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Check the system time on Host2. Is it out of sync with Host1?<br>
    <br>
    Note that the timing and caching of registration messages sent between 
    GRIS and GIIS clients/servers in an MDS infrastructure are controlled 
    by various parameters in the grid-info-resource-register.conf file.<br>
    <br>
    The proper operation of these parameters depends on the 
    synchronization of the system clocks on the hosts involved. If the clocks are not synchronized, registration messages may 
    be lost, and partial data or no data may be returned.<br>
    <br>
    Refer to <i><a href="Config.html">MDS
  2.4  Configuration Files</a></i> for more details on grid-info-resource-register.conf.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no problems are found with trying the above, then try outputting 
        debugging&nbsp;messages by replacing &quot;-d 0&quot; 
  with &quot;-d 255&quot; in the 
        globus-mds (formerly SXXgris) file. This will 
        return much more detailed debugging information. You can also use the 
        Unix syslog daemon, configured in /etc/syslog.conf, to log OpenLDAP 
        messages and GIIS/GRIS back end messages. Refer to the

  <br>
  MDS 2.4 provides mutual authentication between GIIS and GRIS servers and 
  well as between GIIS servers in a hierarchy.&nbsp; Mutual authentication is 
        enabled via a new parameter, bindmethod, in the grid-info-resource-register.conf 
        file. Without this parameter, registration won’t work.&nbsp;Therefore, you 
        need to add the bindmethod parameter to any grid-info-resource-register.conf 
        file you have copied from an existing 
  MDS 2.1 installation.<br>
  <br>
  On the end of each registration block in grid-info-resource-register.conf, 
  add the line:<br>
  <br>
  bindmethod: ANONYM-ONLY<br>
  <br>
  This is the default value, which specifies the use of 
  anonymous binding only.&nbsp;For more details on mutual authentication

<p><a name="mdsperformance"><b>Q. </b></a>

  <b><a name="mdsperformance">

What performance can I expect from a query to an MDS 2 GRIS or GIIS?</a></b></p>
<p>The performance of a 
        query to a GRIS is dependent upon the
        performance of the information providers that the GRIS accesses, as well 
as the TTL data for the information they deliver:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When a query to a 
          GRIS arrives, if the data requested is live and cached, the query will 
  be answered very quickly.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If the data 
          requested has been flushed from the cache because it has expired, then 
          the GRIS will invoke the information provider or providers that supply 
          the information required by the query.&nbsp;If these providers start up and 
          deliver information quickly, then the GRIS can in turn answer the 
          client query relatively quickly, though it will be a little slower 
  than if the data had been in cache.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If an information 
          provider takes a long time to deliver its
          information, either because there is a lot of overhead for it to start 
          up or acquire the data, or because there is a lot of data to deliver, 
          then this will negatively impact the performance the client query 
  sees.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the GRIS 
          will allow a certain, configurable, time window for the information 
          provider to finish its delivery. As a result, if the provider does not 
          finish within the time window, the GRIS will 
          terminate its link to the provider and move on to the next provider, 
          if any. As a result, data from that provider may never appear in the 
          GRIS.&nbsp;To resolve this, either extend the time window that the GRIS 
          waits, or send less data to the GRIS. In this case, though, the client 
          query to the GRIS will take a long time to return, since it will wait 
          for the timeout window and the amount of time to access any other 
  information providers before it can answer the client query.</li>
  <li>
    <p>To extend this time 
          window for the information provider, try increasing the value of the
          timelimit: 
          parameter for the relevant provider in the etc/grid-info-resource-ldif.conf
             file.&nbsp; (Refer to <i><a href="Config.html">
          MDS 2.4 Configuration Files</a></i> for more details on and an
          example of this file.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of a 
        query to a GIIS is dependent upon the performance of the GRIS's that it 
accesses, as well as the TTL data for the information they deliver:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When a query to a 
          GIIS arrives, if the data requested is live and cached, the query will 
  be answered very quickly.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If the data 
          requested has been flushed from cache because it has expired, then the 
          GIIS might query a GRIS that supplies that information. The 
          performance of this sub-query is like any client querying a GRIS, as 
  described above.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, in a 
          GIIS hierarchy, a GIIS query for un-cached data might in turn query a 
          subsidiary GIIS. The performance of this sub-query to another GIIS is 
          based upon whether it has cached data, and if not, the performance of 
  its sub-hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, there is 
        no a priori formula for predicting the performance of a query to MDS. 
        The more complex the GIIS hierarchy, the more unpredictable the 
        performance, and in general, the longer that a query might take to 
        answer, depending upon TTL data.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  It is possible to mitigate this performance variability by attempting to 
  insure that data queried is normally in cache.&nbsp;One can do this either by 
        increasing the TTL value for the data (but that might not make sense), 
        or by causing the cache to fill by periodically running a script that 
        triggers this.&nbsp;This can be done at any or all levels of a GIIS 
        hierarchy, and at the GRIS level as well.&nbsp;If the caches are filled 
        regularly by scripts running periodically, then client queries will most 
likely find the data they are looking for in cache.</p>
