      Proxy</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Full Proxy</dt>
        <dd>        A Full Proxy is a proxy that has been created by grid-proxy-init or
    a proxy created from such a proxy by normal delegation mechanisms.</dd>
        <dt>Limited Proxys</dt>
        <dd>        A Limited Proxy is a proxy that is created from a Full Proxy
            when it delegated with the limited delegation mechanism. The first
            time a proxy is created by the limited delegation mechanism a level
            1 Limited Proxy is created. Any subsequent delegation (limited or
            full) of a level N Limited Proxy creates a level N+1 limited proxy.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="delegation"></a>Delegation Options</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Full Delegation</dt>
        <dd>  Full delegation is the default with the GSI library when
              delegation is requested (note this may vary with individual
              applications). Full delegation of a Full Proxy results in a Full
    Proxy on the remote side. Full delegation of a level N Limited Proxy results
  in a level N+1 Limited Proxy.</dd>
        <dt>Limited Delegation</dt>
        <dd>        Limited delegation is the result of performing delegation with
            the GSI library when the GSS_C_GLOBUS_LIMITED_DELEG_PROXY_FLAG is
            also given. Limited Delegation of a Full Proxy results in a level
            1 Limited Proxy. Limited delegation of a level N Limited Proxy results
            in a level N+1 Limited Proxy.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="authentication"></a>Authentication Options</h2>
      <p align="left">When performing GSI authentication there are three modes
      of operation:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Default</dt>
        <dd>  In this mode a Full Proxy or a level 1 Limited Proxy will be
          accepted for authentication.</dd>
        <dt>GSS_C_GLOBUS_LIMITED_PROXY_FLAG</dt>
        <dd>          With this flag only a Full Proxy will be accepted for
            authentication. This mode should be used by applications that do
          job start-up (e.g. the gatekeeper and sshd).</dd>
        <dt>GSS_C_GLOBUS_LIMITED_PROXY_MANY_FLAG</dt>
        <dd>          With this flag any Full Proxy or Limited Proxy (of any level) will
              be accepted. This mode is currently used for data channel authentication
          with GridFTP.</dd>
