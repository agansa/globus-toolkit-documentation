      <h2>      <a name="GLOBUS_LOCATION"></a>GLOBUS_LOCATION      </h2>
      <p>      The GSI libraries use GLOBUS_LOCATION as one place to look for the trusted
      certificates directory. The location <i>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certficates</i>
      is used if <i>X509_CERT_DIR</i> is not set and <i>/etc/grid-security</i>
      and <i>$HOME/.globus/certificates</i> do not exist.</p>
      <h2>
        <a name="GRIDMAP"></a>GRIDMAP      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to override the default location
      of the grid-mapfile, which is normally <i>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</i>.</p>
      <h2>
        <a name="X509_CERT_DIR"></a>X509_CERT_DIR      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to override the default location
      of the trusted certificates directory, which is normally
        <i>/etc/grid-security/certificates</i>.</p>
      <h2>
<a name="X509_USER_DELEG_PROXY"></a>X509_USER_DELEG_PROXY      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable is set by the GSI libraries to point at the
      location of credentials that it receives during delegation. Application
      servers usually then copy this value to X509_USER_PROXY and users generally
      never see it. Setting this value has no effect.</p>
      <h2>
      <a name="X509_RUN_AS_SERVER"></a>X509_RUN_AS_SERVER (Deprecated
with GT2.2)      </h2>
      <p>      If this environment variable is set (to any value) it causes the
      GSI libraries not to look for a proxy credential unless
      X509_USER_PROXY is explicitly set. The intent is for this to
      be used with servers that should always use a given certificate
      and private key.</p>
      <h2>
        <a name="X509_USER_CERT"></a>X509_USER_CERT      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to override the default location of
      the certificate file. For users this is normally
        <i>$HOME/.globus/usercert.pem</i>. For servers this is normally
        <i>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</i>.</p>
      <h2>
        <a name="X509_USER_KEY"></a>X509_USER_KEY      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to override the default location of
      the private key file. For users this is normally
        <i>$HOME/.globus/userkey.pem</i>. For servers this is normally
        <i>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</i>.</p>
      <h2>
<a name="X509_USER_PROXY"></a>X509_USER_PROXY      </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to override the default location
      of the user proxy credentials, which is normally
        <i>/tmp/x509up_u&lt;uid&gt</i>. To stop the GSI libraries from looking
      for proxy credentials see <a href="#X509_RUN_AS_SERVER">
      X509_RUN_AS_SERVER</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="X509_CERT_FILE"></a>X509_CERT_FILE (Deprecated with GT2.2) </h2>
      <p>      This environment variable can be used to explicitly force the GSI
      libraries to use a given file containing trusted CA certificates.
      Use of this variable is discouraged due to lack of use and testing.
