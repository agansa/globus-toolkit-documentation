<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

    <p>The process of creating a private key and acquiring a certificate for a host is
    relatively simple, as it is a mostly automated process.&nbsp; It should only take a few
    minutes to submit a certificate request to the Certificate Authority.&nbsp; The
    certificate authoriy should respond via email with your certificate within a few days.</p>
    <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create the /etc/grid-security directory if it is not already
    present. Please the <a href="etc_grid_security_v11.html">web page on /etc/grid-security</a>
    for instructions for doing so.</p>
    <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the directions for the
    <a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs/index.html">Globus Certificate 
    Service</a> to obtain a host certificate. You should install the host 
    certificate in /etc/grid-security (i.e. specific -dir /etc/grid-security 
    when running grid-cert-request).</p>
    <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are done you should have two 
    files in the /etc/grid-security direct: <i>usercert.pem</i> and <i>
    userkey.pem</i> (you may also have a usercert_request.pem file which can be 
    ignored). Both should be writtable only by root. The file <i>userkey.pem</i> 
    must be readable only by root.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;4) Create symlinks for GSI use</p>
    <p>For operation with gsi-enabled applications such as gsi-enabled ssh and
      gsiftp, you
    should create some symbolic links at this point so that these applications can find the
    host certificate and key files. The commands to execute are:</p>
    <blockquote>
	<pre># cd /etc/grid-security
    # ln -s usercert.pem hostcert.pem
    # ln -s userkey.pem hostkey.pem
	</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By default, GSI deamons such as gsiftp and sshd will look for these file by the names
    hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem instead of the standard globus names usercert.pem and
    userkey.pem.. These symlinks allow these daemons to operate.</p>
    <p>This is due to the GSI transition as something that is always part of
    Globus to a package that can be stand-alone and will go away in future versions. Sorry for
    the inconvience.</p>
    <p>6) Finish any other need configuration in /etc/grid-security. Please the <a href="etc_grid_security_v11.html">web page on /etc/grid-security</a> for instructions for
    doing so. </p>
