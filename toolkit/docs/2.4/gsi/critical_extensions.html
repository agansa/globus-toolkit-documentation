<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

	<p>
	Currently, as of the 2.0 release of the GSI, only the following critical
	extensions are handled:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>subject_key_identifier</li>
		<li>authority_key_identifier</li>
  		<li>basic_constraints</li>
  		<li>key_usage  </li>
  		<li>ext_key_usage</li>
  		<li>netscape_cert_type</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that these extensions are actually handled by the underlying OpenSSL
	code and not the GSI libraries themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1.1.x releases of the GSI, critical extensions other than the ones listed
	above were ignored.</p>
  <p>
	Starting with 2.0, if an unrecognized critical extension was found, the code
	returns an error.<p>The one action that the GSI libraries do take in regards
  to critical extensions is in regards to the keyCertSign bit in the keyUsage
  extension. If, when checking a proxy certificate, the OpenSSL
  code returns an error because the signing user certificate has the keyCertSign bit
  set to false, the GSI library will cause this error to be ignored.&nbsp;
