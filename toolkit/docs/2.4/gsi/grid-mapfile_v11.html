<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

    <p>For users to be authorized to use GSI-enable services they need to be entered into the
    GSI access control list. For a globus installation this file is: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;deploy-dir&gt;/etc/grid-mapfile</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Or for a GSI installation it is: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It's purpose is to map a GSI Credential to a local user's login name. The GSI
    administrator on the site can map the holder of any GSI credential to any local user name.
    It is up to the GSI administrator to verify that the GSI Identity is owned by and matches
    the local username. </p>
    <p>The grid-mapfile file is plain text file, containing a quoted GSI Credential Name (the <em>subject</em>
    of an X509 certificate) and an unquoted local user name. </p>
    <p>Each subject name in the grid-mapfile must be listed only once. However, multiple
    identities <em>may</em> map to a shared local name. It is up to the GSI administrator to
    ensure that the grid-mapfile entrieis do not violate any site security policies.</p>
    <p>An example of a grid-mapfile entry is:</p>
    <p>&quot;/C=US/O=Globus/O=State University/CN=Joe User&quot; juser</p>
    <p>The grid-mapfile-add-user program, found in </p>
    <p>$GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH/tools/&lt;arch&gt;/sbin</p>
    <p>or </p>
    <p>$GSI_INSTALL_PATH/tools/&lt;arch&gt;/sbin</p>
    <p> can be used to add enteries to the mapfile. For example the following command would
    add a user to the mapfile: </p>
    <p>grid-mapfile-add-entry -dn &quot;/C=US/O=Globus/O=State University/CN=Joe User&quot;
    -ln juser </p>
    <p>You must type in the distinguished name exactly as it appears in the certificate. Not
    doing so will result in an authentication failure. You can get this information directly
    from the certificate by using the following command: </p>
    <p>grid-cert-info --subject --file &lt;certificate file&gt; </p>
    <p>For example, the command</p>
    <p>grid-cert-info --subject --file ~/.globus/usercert.pem</p>
    <p>will print the certificate subject for the x509 certificate in the file
    ~/.globus/usercert.pem. This is the default location for a user's certificate file. </p>
    <p>You also need to quote the distringuished name so that the shell processes it
    correctly. </p>
