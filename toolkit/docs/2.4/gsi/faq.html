<p><b><a name="cert_reuse">Can
          we use Globus/Grid certificates for other purposes?</a></b></p>
 
<p>Use of a Globus
      certificate for other applications, such as e-mail and web is technically
      feasible. The other applications require the usage field to be defined
      as well as vendor specific fields. The easiest way to ensure the correct
      fields are generated is to use a browser such as Netscape or IE to create
      the multi-purpose certificate. The certificate can be transfered to the
      Globus directory using PKCS12 file format, which is known to be available
      on Netscape (IE has to be checked). The certificate can also be written
      to a smart card using either GRID or Netscape software. The Globus Project
      has demonstrated a smart card with a GSI certificate on the PCMCIA interface
      of a portable PC.</p>
 
<p>There are
      security considerations related to using a certificate for multiple purposes,
      however. Normally different certificates are issued for different purposes.
      Care should be given when considering whether to mix security credentials,
      even in the early stages of a project.</p>
 
<p><b><a name="new_cas">How
          do we add new trusted CAs in Globus software?</a></b></p>
 
<p>New CAs can
      be added to a client or server's file of trusted CAs, and then added to
      the certificate signing policy file. The certificate signing policy file
      defines who is allowed to sign a certificate. Adding new CAs to an existing
      Grid is admittedly a significant administrative overhead, so we do not
      recommend that it be done frequently.</p>
 
<p>Directions
      for doing so may be found <a href="adding_trusted_ca.html">here</a>.</p>
 
<p><b><a name="cert_revoke">How is certificate revocation implemented in Globus?</a></b></p>
<p>Each CA has a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) in the trusted certificates
  directory. The CRL files need to be updated from master copies routinely. To
  be effective, a collaboration will need a common policy between CAs for updating
  CRLs, e.g. when a certificate has been compromised.</p>
<p>Note that any user with a valid certificate can be prevented from using any
  resource at any time simply by removing their entry in the resource's grid
  map file.</p>
<p><b><a name="delegation">What is Certificate Delegation?</a></b></p>
<p>Globus has implemented Certificate Delegation, which allows a process, such
  as the Globus gatekeeper, to act on behalf of the client. The implementation
  is based on SSL and allows a client to delegate a proxy certificate to the
  gatekeeper server.</p>
<p><b><a name="kerberos">How can Kerberos be integrated with certficate based
      authentication?</a></b></p>
<p>PKINIT, which can generate a Kerberos TGT from a certificate, is being worked
  on in the IETF and the final solution will be implemented in the reference
  version of MIT Kerberos. This is expected to take about 1 year. W2000 has implemented
  an early version of this work. Pending availability of the final standard,
  Globus have implemented extensions to an MIT Kerberos KDC, called SSLCD-SSLK5.
  This allows a client to connect to gatekeeper with a delegated proxy certificate
  and then use globus services on that systems which are configured using Kerberos
  v5. This can avoid the need for separate Globus processes when Kerberos processes
  are already available.</p>
<p>The reverse capability of generating a Globus Proxy Certificate from a Kerberos
  v5 TGT is provided by the Globus K5cert software. The source code needs to
  be linked with the MIT Kerberos libraries, but does not require extensions
  to the KDC. This functionality can provide SSO for both a Kerberos v5 and Globus
  environment, provided the CA of the proxy certificate is trusted by other Globus
  sites.</p>
<p>On the topic of interoperability between W2000 and MIT Kerberos, it should
  be possible for W2000 clients to authenticate to MIT Kerberos, acquire a TGT
  and then a service ticket for Active Directory which gives the SID authorization
  data, necessary for W2000.</p>
<p><b><a name="new_features">What new features are planned for GSI (Grid Security
      Infrastructure)?</a></b></p>
<p>An X.509 certificate repository is planned to overcome the problem of travelling
  users who may not have their certificates locally available, for example at
  conferences, cybercafes, or other remote sites. Code for this, called myproxy,
  is nearing completion. Clients can submit proxy certifiates to the repository
  for a pre-specified time period. The certificate (and private key) can be retrieved
  via a SSL portal. The myproxy code is being developed by the portal group of
  the Globus team. </p>
<p>In addition, the idea of restricted delegation is being developed. It is expected
  that people will have many certificates to be used for different tasks or at
  different sites. Depending on the activity, a user can delegate the use of
  an appropriate certificate to a server. This combines nicely with certificate
  repositories, where you may only want a restricted set of capabilities, for
  example, e-mail, to be available during your travels, leaving your other certificates
  safely at home.</p>
