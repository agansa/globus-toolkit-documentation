      <h2><big>Authentication Checks</big></h2>
      <p>The following are in addition to standard X.509 certificate path
      validation checks performed by OpenSSL.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Every Certification Authority (CA) in the peer's chain must have a <a href="adding_trusted_ca.html">signing_policy
          file</a> present in the trusted certificates directory on the local
          system. The file contains one or more namespace prefixes. Any
          certificate issued by the CA must have a subject name matched by one
          or more of the prefixes. This comparison is done in a case-sensitive
          manner.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><big>Authorization Checks</big></h2>
      After authentication one of the following authorization checks is normally done:
      <ol>
        <li>Services will typically call gss_assist routines to check for the presence of
          the DN in the grid-mapfile and map it to a local username. This check is done in a
          case-sensitive manner.</li>
        <li>Clients connecting to a service will normally expect a host or
          service certificate. In this case the common name (CN) of the DN is
          expected to contain the hostname on which the service. This comparison
          is done in a case-insensitive manner.</li>
        <li>If the client specified an explicit DN that it expected, this
          comparison is done using OpenSSL's X509_NAME_loneline() and strcmp(), which
          is a case-sensitive comparison.</li>
        <li>If the application is using GlobusIO and passes in an explicit DN,
          GlobusIO does this comparison in a case-sensitive manner.</li>
        <li>A application may just get the DN returned to it directly, either
          through GlobusIO authorization callback functionality or by using the
          GSSAPI directly, in which case it's up to the application how
          authorization is performed.</li>
      </ol>
