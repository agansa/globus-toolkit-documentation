    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Note: these instructions are valid for version 2.0 of the GSI software.</p>
    <p>Installing a trusted CA (Certificate Authority) certificate on a system means that the
    system now completely trusts that CA in terms of authentication. This is a major policy
    decision and should not be taken lightly. You want to understand who is running the CA,
    how it is being run, and to whom and how is it issuing certificates. Then you need to
    decide that this CA is acceptable to trust for your resources.</p>
    <p>This document assumes you are somewhat familar with security and PKI. It does not cover
    all the policy issues surrounding trusting a new CA and uses some common security terms
    freely. If you don't understand all the the policy issues or security terms in this
    document you should talk with someone who does before proceeding.</p>
    <h2><a name="what systems">On what systems does a new trusted CA
    certificate need to be installed?</a></h2>
    <p>You want to install a new trusted CA certificate on every system on your Grid (clients
    and servers). Yes, this is a major undertaking.</p>
    <p>Technically the only systems that need to have the new trusted CA certificate installed
    are thoses that are wanting to securely communicate with an entity (user or resource) that
    has a certificate signed by the new trusted CA. </p>
    <p>For example, if a client has a certificate signed by the new trusted CA, any Grid
    resources that client connects to will need to have the new trusted CA certificate
    installed. Plus the client themselves will need to have the trusted CA certificate
    installed.</p>
    <p>If a resource has a certificate signed by a new trusted CA certificate any clients
    connecting to this resource will need to have the new trusted CA certificate installed.</p>
    <p>However Grid software is very complicated and interacts in ways that are not
    immediately obvious, so trying to guess where a new CA files might be needed is not always
    easy, hence it is often better to just bite the bullet and do it everywhere.</p>
    <h2><a name="installing">Installing the new trusted CA certificate</a></h2>
    <p>Note: these instructions are valid for version 2.0 of the GSI software.</p>
    <p>Ideally with the new packaging software with the Globus 2.0 release, adding a new
    trusted CA should be done by installing a new package containing the needed files for that
    CA. The steps below describe the manual process for doing so.</p>
    <p>The steps for installing a new trusted CA certificate are:<ol>
      <li>Read the introduction to this webpage and make sure you understand the policy issues
        behind what you are doing.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Get the new CA's certificate in PEM format. You need to get the certificate from a
        trusted source and be certain that it is actually the certificate for the CA - i.e. make
        sure no one has substituted a different certificate either accidentially or maliciously.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Install the CA certificate in your <em>/etc/grid-security/certificates</em> directory.
        It must be in a file named after a hash of the CA's name. To generate this hash run the
        following command (assuming <em>ca_cert.pem</em> contains the CA certificate, otherwise
        replace that with the appropriate filename):<br>
        <br>
        openssl x509 -in <em>ca_cert.pem</em> -hash -noout<br>
        <br>
        Then append &quot;<em>.0</em>&quot; (a dot followed by a zero) to this hash. This is the
        filename you should use. For example the Globus CA certificate is stored in a file with
        the name <em>42864e48.0<br>
        <br>
        </em>This file should be world-readable, but not writable (e.g. unix file permissions of
        0644 or 0444 are acceptable).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Get the signing policy of the new CA. This is a statement what names the CA will issue
        certificates for. This will be three lines that look like the following:<br>
        <br>
        access_id_CA X509 '/C=US/O=Globus/CN=Globus Certification Authority'<br>
        pos_rights globus CA:sign<br>
        cond_subjects globus '&quot;/C=us/O=Globus/*&quot; &quot;/C=US/O=Globus/*&quot;
        &quot;/O=Grid/O=Globus/*&quot;'<br>
        <br>
        Hopefully the CA will provide you with these lines (in which case you should still look
        them over and make sure they are reasonable).<br>
        <br>
        The first line should be the text &quot;<em>access_id_CA X509</em>&quot; followed by the
        subject name of the new CA in single quotes.<br>
        <br>
        The second line should be the text &quot;<em>pos_rights globus CA:sign</em>&quot;. This
        text is constant, do not modify it.<br>
        <br>
        The third line contains the text &quot;<em>cond_subjects globus</em>&quot; followed by one
        or more simple wildcard strings, in double quotes, describing DNs (names in certificates)
        that the new CA is allowed to issue. If there is more than one of these strings, they must
        then be enclosed in a set of single quotes.<br>
        <br>
        Word of warning: the code that parses the policy text is not very robust and does not
        handle misfortmatted text gracefully. Double check this text for format, especially
        missing quotes.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Place the policy in a file named after the same hash used in step 3 with the text &quot;<em>.signing_policy</em>&quot;
        appended.<br>
        <br>
        For example the Globus CA's signing policy is stored in a file with the name <em>42864e48.signing_policy</em><br>
      </li>
      <li>That should do it.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
