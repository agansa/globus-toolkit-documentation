<p><i>Replica management</i> is an important issue for a number
of scientific applications. Consider a data set that contains one petabyte 
(one thousand million megabytes) of
experimental results for a particle physics application. While the complete data set may exist in
one or possibly several physical locations, it is likely that few universities, research laboratories or
individual researchers will have sufficient storage to hold a complete copy. Instead, they will
store copies of the most relevant portions of the data set on local storage for faster access.
Replica Management is the process of keeping track of where portions of the data set can be found.</p>


A working document of the Global Grid Forum, <cite><A href="http://www.isi.edu/~annc/gridforum/ggf1replica.pdf">An
Architecture for  Replica Management in Grid Computing Environments</A></cite>,
describes this concept in detail.
<p>Globus Replica Management integrates the <a href="replica-catalog.html"> Globus Replica Catalog</a> (for keeping track of
replicated files) and <a href="gridftp.html"> GridFTP</a> (for moving data) and provides replica management 
capabilities for data grids.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Our replica management implementation involves a software API (<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c/globus_replica_management/html/index.html">globus_replica_management</a>),
an associated library, and a command-line tool
providing the same functionality.</p>

      <p>The globus_replica_management library provides client functions that allow
      files to be registered with the replica management service, published to
      replica locations, and moved among multiple locations.  The library uses the
      Globus Replica Catalog and GridFTP technologies to accomplish this work.</p>
      
      <p>The Globus Replica Management API and library are further described in
      our working documentation, <CITE><A href="deliverables/ReplicaManagementService.pdf">A Replica Management Service for 
High-Performance Data Grids</A></CITE>.</p>

 <h2>Availability</h2>
    
    <p>Our data grid software is currently available to the public as components
      of the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release.  Prior to this
    release, the software was tested and 
    evaluated for more than a year by several
    <a href="projects.html">
    external project teams</a> who are using our technologies to build data 
    grids for their own use.</p>
