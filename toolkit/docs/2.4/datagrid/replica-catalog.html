<p><i>Replica management</i> is an important issue for a number
of scientific applications. Consider a data set that contains one petabyte 
(one thousand million megabytes) of
experimental results for a particle physics application. While the complete data
  set may exist in one or possibly several physical locations, it is likely that
  few universities, research laboratories or individual researchers will have
  sufficient storage to hold a complete copy. Instead, they will store copies
  of the most relevant portions of the data set on local storage for faster access.
Replica Management is the process of keeping track of where portions of the data
  set can be found.</p>

      <p>A working document of the Global Grid Forum, <cite><A href="http://www.isi.edu/~annc/gridforum/ggf1replica.pdf">An Architecture for 
Replica Management in Grid Computing Environments</A></cite>, describes this concept
in detail.</p>

<p>The Globus Replica Catalog supports replica management by providing mappings between 
logical names for files and one or more copies of the files on physical storage systems.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

      <p>Our implementation of the Globus Replica Catalog involves a software API,
an associated library, and a command-line tool
providing the same functionality.</p>

      <p>The globus_replica_catalog library provides client functions that allow
manipulation of data in a replica catalog.  In this implementation, the 
library runs against a standard LDAP directory server.  (There are currently
numerous widely-avaliable commercial and open source LDAP servers that can be
used with this library.)&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Despite its current LDAP-based implementation, the API has been constructed to be independent of
      LDAP, so future implementations could use other access protocols or
storage mechanisms (e.g., SQL).</p>

      <p>The Globus Replica Catalog is further described in our working documentation,
<cite><A href="deliverables/replicaGettingStarted.pdf">Getting Started with the Globus 
Replica Catalog</A></cite>.</p>

 <h2>Availability</h2>
    
    <p>Our data grid software is currently available to the public as components of
    the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release.  Prior to this
    release, the software was tested and 
    evaluated for more than a year by several <a href="projects.html">
    external project teams</a> who are using our technologies to build data 
    grids for their own use.</p>
