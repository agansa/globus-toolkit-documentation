    <p>The Globus Project is currently engaged in defining and developing the following core
    capabilities which we believe will be necessary in order to build data grids
    for scientific collaborations.<ul>
      <li><a href="gridftp.html">GridFTP</a>: A high-performance, secure, robust
        data transfer mechanism</li>
      <li><a href="replica-catalog.html">Globus Replica Catalog</a>: A mechanism for maintaining a catalog of dataset replicas.</li>
      <li><a href="replica-management.html">Globus Replica Management</a>: A mechanism that ties together the Replica Catalog
      and GridFTP technologies, allowing applications to create and manage replicas of 
      large datasets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Our data grid software is currently available to the public as components
      of the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release.  Prior to this
    release, the software was tested and 
    evaluated for more than a year by several
    <a href="projects.html">
    external project teams</a> who are using our technologies to build data 
    grids for their own use.</p>
