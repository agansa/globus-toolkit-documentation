    <p>A number of scientific collaborations are currently building data grids for 
    their own use, using the Globus data grid technologies as a starting point for 
    their work. We
      work closely with these groups to define requirements on our core
    technologies and to coordinate development efforts.  These groups
    have tested our software and provided valuable feedback and bug reports in 
    addition to providing invaluable opportunities for "field tests".</p>
    
    <p><b>Earth Systems Grid</b><br>
    The Earth Systems Grid (ESG) is an experimental data grid for scientists 
    collaborating on climate studies.  The data is collected from ground and 
    satellite-based sensors or generated via simulations.  Scientists can
    register and "publish" their data for use by the community.  Applications allow
    scientists to specify parameters for climate model visualizations using
    intuitive settings and then gather the required data from the community's
    distributed data systems.  A metadata catalog is used to identify relevant datasets and
    files, and Globus data grid technologies are used to locate "nearby"
    copies of the files and to transfer data to the local software using 
    high-speed data transfer.</p>
    
    <p><b>European DataGrid</b><br>
    The European <A href="http://www.eu-datagrid.org/">DataGrid</a> project is an 
    international project for shared cost research and technological development. 
    The DataGrid project is focused on solving the data management and
    analysis needs of the world-wide high-energy physics community and the next generation of
    supercolliders at CERN.
    
    <p><b>GriPhyN</b><br>
    The <a href="http://www.griphyn.org/"> GriPhyN (Grid Physics Network)</a> collaboration 
is a team of experimental physicists and information technology (IT) researchers 
who plan to implement the first Petabyte-scale computational environments for 
data intensive science in the 21st century. 
The CMS and ATLAS experiments at the 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will search for the origins of mass and 
probe matter at the smallest length scales; LIGO (Laser Interferometer 
Gravitational-wave Observatory) will detect the gravitational waves of pulsars, 
supernovae and in-spiraling binary stars; and SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) will carry out 
an automated sky survey enabling systematic studies of stars, galaxies, nebula, 
and large-scale structure.</p>
    
      <p><b>Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation</b><br>
    <a href="http://www.neesgrid.org/">NEESgrid</a> is a virtual laboratory for 
    the earthquake engineering community. NEESgrid is funded by the National
      Science Foundation for a 
six month scoping study. The goal of the study is to develop a systems design 
for integrating experimental and computational facilities for use by the 
earthquake engineering community, which includes structural engineering, geotechnical 
engineering, and tsunami research.</p>
    
    <p><b>Particle Physics Data Grid</b><br>
    The <a href="http://www.ppdg.net/"> Particle Physics Data Grid (PPDG)</a> collaboration, like the European DataGrid
    project, focuses on the needs of high-energy physicists.  Composed mainly of
    American institutions, PPDG is working toward the creation of a collaboratory
    for particle physicists attempting to experimentally verify theories regarding
    the fundamental nature of matter and energy.</p>
