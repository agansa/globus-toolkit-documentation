    <p>Most of the Globus data grid technologies are new enough that formal
    evaluation has not yet been done.  While some formal evaluation efforts 
    have been conducted on specific software pieces (GridFTP libraries,
    Globus Replica Catalog command line tool, etc.), much
    evaluation remains to be done.</p>
    
    <p>We are, of course, constantly evaluating our work based on our
    ability to use these technologies to support <a href="projects.html"> external
    projects</a>.  In this sense,
    we are constantly discovering areas for improvement and areas that have
    already been highly successful.</p>
    
    <p>As results of these efforts are written down and reported, we will
    expand this section of our website to include papers, presentations,
    and other reports on our work.</p>
