    <p>GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol optimized
    for high-bandwidth wide-area networks.  The GridFTP protocol is based on FTP, the
    highly-popular Internet file transfer protocol.  We have selected a set of protocol
    features and extensions defined already in IETF RFCs and added a few additional
    features to meet requirements from current data grid projects.</p>
    
      <p>Our white paper, <i><a href="deliverables/C2WPdraft3.pdf">GridFTP:
      Universal Data Transfer for the Grid</a></i>, describes the motivations
      behind this work in more detail.  A subsequent update titled <cite><a href="deliverables/GridFTP-Overview-200201.pdf">GridFTP
      Update, January 2002</a></cite> provides the latest news regarding GridFTP, including current 
      status and plans for future development.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Protocol Features</h2>
    
    <p>GridFTP provides the following protocol features.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><a href="../security/">GSI security</a>
      on control and data channels
    <li>Multiple data channels for parallel transfers
    <li>Partial file transfers
    <li>Third-party (direct server-to-server) transfers
    <li>Authenticated data channels
    <li>Reusable data channels
    <li>Command pipelining
    </ul>
    
      
    
      <p>We have prepared a <a href="http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/dsl/GridFTP-Protocol-RFC-Draft.pdf"> draft specification</a> for the GridFTP protocol through the
    Global Grid Forum, and intend to submit a draft standard to the IETF for review
    and approval.</p> 
    
     
    
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    
    <p>Our implementation of the GridFTP protocol takes the form of two APIs and
    corresponding libraries: <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c/globus_ftp_control/html/index.html"> globus_ftp_control</a> and
    <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c/globus_ftp_client/html/index.html">globus_ftp_client</a>.  Our
    libraries use high-performance I/O and security services provided by the 
    <a href="../toolkit/">Globus Toolkit</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Besides supporting the protocol features described above, our APIs
    also include interfaces for adding software "plug-ins".  These plug-ins 
    allow developers to add customized reliability and fault tolerance, 
    performance monitoring, and extended data processing.</p> 
    
      <p>In addition to our software libraries, we have also implemented
    an API/library (<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/api/c/globus_gass_copy/html/index.html">globus_gass_copy</a>) 
    and a command-line tool (globus-url-copy) that integrates GridFTP, HTTP, and local file I/O to enable
    secure transfers using any combination of these protocols.</p>
     
     <p>Finally, we have adapted a popular FTP server package
      (Washington University's wu-ftpd) to support a majority of the GridFTP
      protocol features (GSI security, parallel transfer, third-party transfer,
      partial file transfer).</p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    
    <p>Our data grid software is currently available to the public as components of
    the <a href="../toolkit/"> Globus Toolkit 2.0</a> release.  Prior to this
    release, the software was tested and 
    evaluated for more than a year by several
    <a href="projects.html">
    external project teams</a> who are using our technologies to build data 
    grids for their own use.</p>
