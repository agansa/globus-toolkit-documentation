     <blockquote><em>"Access to distributed
    data is typically as important as access to distributed computational resources."</em></blockquote>
    
    <p>Distributed scientific and engineering applications often require access to large
    amounts of data (terabytes or petabytes). Future applications envisioned by our team also
    require widely distributed access to data. (For example, access in many places by many
    people, virtual collaborative environments, etc.)</p>
    
    <p>The Globus Project's data grid effort attempts to identify, prototype, and
    evaluate the key technologies required to support data grids for scientific and
    engineering collaborations.</p>
    
    <p>Our work includes the following major activities.</p>
