      <p>The Globus Project focuses on challenges associated with collaborative
      science and engineering spanning multiple organizations.  It is our intent to offer a
    generic data grid infrastructure in the form of core data transfer services 
    and generic data management libraries. These fundamental building blocks can 
    then be used in a variety of interesting ways to build systems and
      applications for specific end users.</p>

    <p>The distributed scientific computing community has envisioned a number of
    strategies for supporting the needs of collaborative, data-intensive science
    and engineering.&nbsp; We offer the following papers that
    outline our proposed strategy.<ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers.php#DG1">The Data Grid: Towards an Architecture for
        the Distributed Management and Analysis of Large Scientific Datasets</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers.php#ACAT3">Protocols and Services for Distributed Data-Intensive
        Science</a></li>
