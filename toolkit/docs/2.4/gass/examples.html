    Simple use</p>
    <p align="left">A
    program that is to run on one or more remote MPPs can be modified to replace all
    open/close/fopen/fclose calls with gass_* versions. The program will then operate
    correctly on the remote computers. Furthermore, if multiple processes created on the
    remote computer read the same file, the file is copied only once.</p>
