<h2><a name="GASS Server Overview">GASS Server Overview</a></h2>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The GASS server API is used to construct a server that
  can service get and put requests made by the GASS client API using x-gass URLs.
  Each of these operations can be performed to/from memory,&nbsp; to/from a file
  descriptor, or a combination of both.<br>
      <br>
Note: All timestamps are as seconds since the epoch. (01 Jan 1970, 00:00 GMT)</p>

and Deactivation</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;GASS uses standard Globus module activation and deactivation. Before
any GASS server functions are called, the following function must be called: </p>

<p>globus_module_activate(GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if GASS was successfully initialized,
  and you are therefore allowed to subsequently call GASS server functions. Otherwise,
  and error code is returned, and GASS server functions should not be subsequently
  called. This function may be called multiple times.</p>
<p>To deactivate GASS cache, the following function must be called:</p>
<p>globus_module_deactivate(GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function should be called once for each time the GASS server was activated.</p>

Create a port and listen on it for get and put requests&nbsp; made by a globus_gass_client

If *port is set to 0 when this function is called, then an anonymous port is
used, and the port is returned in *port. Otherwise, the port specified by *port
is used. 

<p>The get_callback and put_callback arguments, if not GLOBUS_GLOBUS_GASS_NULL,
  specify functions to call when a globus_gass_client_get or globus_gass_client_put
  request is made to this server, respectively. The behavior of each of these
  callbacks is described below.<br>
      <br>
  This function returns GLOBUS_GLOBUS_GASS_SUCCESS if it is successful, otherwise
  a non-zero error code.<br>
      <br>
  In single threaded code, nexus_poll() or nexus_cond_wait() should be called

<p>If this callback returns a value other than GLOBUS_SUCCESS, the globus_gass_client
  get request will fail with a GLOBUS_GLOBUS_GASS_REQUEST_SERVER_FAILURE and

<p>If this callback returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS, this request structure must be subsequently
  freed by calling <a href="#globus_gass_server_get_request_done">globus_gass_server_get_request_done()</a>.
  It should also set *timestamp to the file's timestamp or GLOBUS_GLOBUS_GASS_UNKNOWN_TIMESTAMP

  If buffer==NULL, then gass will allocate a memory buffer with a maximum size
  of buffer_length, and a minimum size of wait_length. If buffer_length==GLOBUS_GASS_LENGTH_UNKNOWN,
  then gass will choose a buffer length of at least wait_length bytes. Buffers
  that are allocated by gass must be explicitly freed by calling <a href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_memory_free">globus_gass_server_put_request_memory_free()</a>. </p>
<p>If buffer!=NULL, then buffer_length is the maximum number of bytes that can
  be read into the buffer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At least wait_length bytes will then be received into this buffer, unless
  fewer bytes remain in the request. <br>
</p>
<p>For a single request, calls to <a
    href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_fd">globus_gass_server_put_request_fd()</a> and <a href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_memory">globus_gass_server_put_request_memory()</a> can
  be intermixed. Further, multiple calls to these function can be outstanding,
  and their order will be preserved.</p>
<p>This function returns the current status of the request, as described in globus_gass_server_put_callback_t().
  If the return value is GLOBUS_GASS_REQUEST_PENDING, then once the requested
  operation completes the callback function is called. </p>

  This function is called as a result of completion of a <a

  <br>
  receive_length is actual length of the portion of data received for this <a

  <br>
  The request-&gt;status field is set to the current status of the request, as
  described in globus_gass_server_put_callback_t(). A value of GLOBUS_GASS_REQUEST_PENDING,
  implies that subsequent calls to <a href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_fd">globus_gass_server_put_request_fd()</a> and/or <a href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_memory">globus_gass_server_put_request_memory()</a> should
  be made to receive the remainder of the request's data.<br>

  Notes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>receive_length may be greater than 0 even if request-&gt;status is GLOBUS_GASS_REQUEST_*_FAILURE. </p>
  <p>If a call to <a href="#globus_gass_server_put_request_memory">globus_gass_server_put_request_memory()</a> is
    outstanding after the request completes or fails, this callback will be called
    with receive_length set to 0. </p>
  <p>The request-&gt;outstanding field can be used to determine the<br>
