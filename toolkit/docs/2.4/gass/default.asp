   <p>GASS simplifies the porting and running of applications that use file I/O to the Globus
    environment. Libraries and utilities are provided to eliminate the need to</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>manually login to sites and ftp files</li>
        <li>install a distributed file system</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The APIs are designed to allow reuse of programs that use Unix or standard C I/O with
    little or no modification. </p>
    <p>Currently the ftp and x-gass (GASS server) protocols are supported.</p>
    <p><a href="requirements.html">GASS Requirements</a></p>
    <p>The typical user's view of GASS comprises a simple file access API for opening,
    closing, and prefetching files. Planned are some RSL extensions for remote cache
    management. <ul>
      <li><a href="file/default.asp">File Access API</a> (also viewable with <a href="file/functions.html">no frames</a>) </li>
      <li>RSL extensions (to be defined)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, we also publish three APIs concerned with the details of cache management
    and data transfer. These APIs are used to implement the file access API, but are also
    available to users for specialized purposes (e.g., defining a specialized GASS server or
    implementing a high-speed GASS client). &nbsp; <ul>
      <li><a href="cache/default.asp">Cache Management API</a> (also viewable with <a href="cache/functions.html">no frames</a>)</li>
      <li><a href="client/default.asp">Client API</a> (also viewable with <a href="client/functions.html">no frames)</a></li>
      <li><a href="server/default.asp">Server API</a> (also viewable with <a href="server/functions.html">no frames</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to allow simple GASS server functionality to be embedded into other
    applications, we also supply an easy-to-use, higher-level library on top of the GASS
    server API.&nbsp; This API optionally gives any GASS client read or write access to files,
    and will also allow clients to append output to the server's stdout and stderr.<ul>
      <li><a href="server_ez/default.asp">GASS Server EZ API</a> (also viewable with <a href="server_ez/function_reference.html">no frames</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A number of GASS utilities are documented on the <a href="http://www.globus.org/details/programs.html">Globus programs</a> web page.</p>
