<p align="left">&nbsp;GASS uses standard Globus module activation and deactivation.
  Before any GASS server_ez functions are called, the following function must
be called: </p>
<p>globus_module_activate(GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if GASS was successfully initialized,
  and you are therefore allowed to subsequently call GASS server_ez functions.
  Otherwise, and error code is returned, and GASS server_ez functions should
  not be subsequently called. This function may be called multiple times.</p>
<p>To deactivate GASS server_ez, the following function must be called:</p>
<p>globus_module_deactivate(GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function should be called once for each time the GASS server_ez was activated.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned short *port, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char **url, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned long options, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; globus_gass_server_ez_client_shutdown_t callback) </p>

<p>Initialize the GASS Server EZ library and listen on an URL.&nbsp; Multiple
  gass_server_ez handlers may be initialized in the same program. After this
  call, your program will handle GASS file requests automatically by the globus
  runtime library (or when an explicit <a href="#globus_gass_server_poll">globus_gass_server_ez_poll</a>()
  is called, for non-threaded programs). </p>
<p>The port argument is a pointer to the desired TCP port you wish to listen
  on. If *port == 0, then a port will be assigned by the system. </p>
<p>The url argument is a pointer which will be set to a buffer containing the
  URL of the GASS server (of the form x-gass://host:port). GASS clients will
  use this url to connect to your program. The user program must free this buffer
  with globus_free(); </p>
<p>The options argument is a logical ORing of one or more of the following options,
  which control the behavior of the GASS Server EZ library: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_LINE_BUFFER</strong> Files opened for writing
    will be written a line at a time, so multiple writers can access them safely. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_TILDE_EXPAND</strong> URLs of the form x-gass://host:port/~/filename
    will have the '~' character expanded to be the home directory of the user
    who is running the server. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_TILDE_USER_EXPAND</strong> URLs of the form
    x-gass://host:port/~user/filename will have the '~user' string expanded to
    the home directory of the user on the server machine. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_READ_ENABLE</strong> GASS &quot;get&quot; requests
    will be honored. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_WRITE_ENABLE</strong> GASS &quot;put&quot; requests
    will be honored. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_STDOUT_ENABLE</strong> GASS &quot;put&quot; requests
    to the URL &quot;x-gass://host:port/dev/stdout&quot; will be redirected to
    the standard output stream of the gass server. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_STDERR_ENABLE</strong> GASS &quot;put&quot; requests
    to the URL &quot;x-gass://host:port/dev/stderr&quot; will be redirected to
    the standard output stream of the gass server. </p>
  <p><strong>GLOBUS_GASS_SERVER_EZ_CLIENT_SHUTDOWN_ENABLE</strong> GASS &quot;put&quot; requests
    to the URL &quot;x-gass://host:port/dev/globus_gass_client_shutdown&quot; will
    cause the callback argument to globus_gass_server_ez_init to be called. This
    allows the GASS client to communicate shutdown requests to the server. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if the server library is successfully
  initialized. Any other return value indicates an error has occurred. </p>
<hr align="center">
<p><a name="globus_gass_server_ez_shutdown">int <br>
      <strong>globus_gass_server_ez_shutdown</strong></a>(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned short port) </p>
<p>Shutdown the globus_gass_server_ez library. The server will not accept any
  further data connections. This call will block until all outstanding requests
  have been serviced. </p>
<p>The port argument should match the port returned from the <a
    href="#globus_gass_server_ez_init">globus_gass_server_ez_init</a>() call. </p>
<p>This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if the server library is successfully

<hr align="center">
<p><a name="globus_gass_server_poll">void <br>
      <strong>globus_gass_server_poll</strong></a>(); </p>
<p>This function should be called regularly in a non-threaded program to ensure
  that client requests are serviced. </p>
