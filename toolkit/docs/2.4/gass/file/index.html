<h2><a
    name="GASS File Access Overview">GASS File Access Overview</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;The file access API defines <a href="#globus_gass_open">globus_gass_open()</a>, <a href="#globus_gass_close">globus_gass_close()</a>, <a
    href="#globus_gass_fopen">globus_gass_fopen()</a>, and <a
    href="#globus_gass_fclose">globus_gass_fclose()</a> calls.&nbsp; These are
  replacements for the Unix open(), and close() calls, and the C fopen(), and
  fclose() calls. They handle the three file access patterns listed earlier.&nbsp; A
  file opened and closed with these calls can be read and written with ordinary
  Unix I/O calls.&nbsp; Hence, a program can be modified to operate in a wide-area
  environment simply by modifying their program to use these calls in place of
open(), close(), fopen(), and fclose().</p>
<p>Note that in the future we may use techniques such as those used in Condor
  of UFO to replace calls to open/close etc. with the corresponding CASS calls,
  thereby avoiding the need for source code modifications altogether.&nbsp; However,
  such modifications are not planned for the short term.</p>
<p>A data structure called a &quot;tag list&quot; is associated with each cache
  entry, which provides a soft of reference counting on the cache entry.&nbsp; When
  a computation opens a file, a tag containing the job's name is added to the
  tag list of the cache entry; when the computation closes the file, the tag
  is deleted, and if there are no more tags for this cache entry then the cache
  file is also deleted.&nbsp; This approach allows a Globus Resource Allocation
  Manager (GRAM) to clean up after computations that terminate abnormally, by
  removing any extraneous files from the cache.

    name="GASS File Access Overview">GASS File Access API Limitations</a></h2>

<p>&nbsp;The operations which can be done to GASS-opened file descriptors are
a subset of those available with general file descriptors.</p>
<h2><a
    name="GASS File Activation and Deactivation">GASS File Activation
and Deactivation</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;GASS uses standard Globus module activation and deactivation. Before
any GASS functions are called, the following function must be called: </p>
<p>globus_module_activate(GLOBUS_GASS_FILE_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if GASS was successfully initialized,
  and you are therefore allowed to subsequently call GASS functions. Otherwise,
  and error code is returned, and GASS functions should not be subsequently called.
  This function may be called multiple times.</p>
<p>To deactivate GASS, the following function must be called:</p>
<p>globus_module_deactivate(GLOBUS_GASS_FILE_MODULE);</p>
<p>This function should be called once for each time GASS was activated.</p>

<p>Same arguments, return value, and semantics as open(),except that the file

<blockquote>
  <p>O_RDONLY<br>
      <br>
    Lookup the file in the local cache. If it does not exist, then copy the file
    from the remote server into local cache. Add a tag to the cache entry's tag
    list. Open the local file for read-only access. When the file is closed,
    remove the tag from cache entry's tag list, and delete the cache entry if
    the tag list is empty.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC<br>
      <br>
    Lookup the file in the local cache. If it exists, then truncate it. Otherwise,
    create an empty file in the local cache. Add a tag to the cache entry's tag
    list. Open the local file for write-only access. When the file is closed,
    copy it from the local cache to the remote server, remove the tag from cache
    entry's tag list, and delete the cache entry if the tag list is empty.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>O_WRONLY<br>
      <br>
    Lookup the file in the local cache. If it does not exist, then copy the file
    from the remote server into local cache. Add a tag to the cache entry's tag
    list. Open the local file for write-only access. When the file is closed,
    copy it from the local cache to the remote server, remove the tag from cache
    entry's tag list, and delete the cache entry if the tag list is empty.<br>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>O_RDWR<br>
      <br>
    Lookup the file in the local cache. If it does not exist, then copy the file
    from the remote server into local cache. Add a tag to the cache entry's tag
    list. Open the local file for read-write access. When the file is closed,
    copy it from the local cache to the remote server, remove the tag from cache
    entry's tag list, and delete the cache entry if the tag list is empty.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>O_RDWR | O_TRUNC<br>
      <br>
    Lookup the file in the local cache. If it exists, then truncate it. Otherwise,
    create an empty file in the local cache. Add a tag to the cache entry's tag

    copy it from the local cache to the remote server, remove the tag from cache
    entry's tag list, and delete the cache entry if the tag list is empty. <br>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>O_APPEND</p>
  <p>O_WRONLY | O_APPEND</p>
  <p>Create a socket connection to the server, so that data written to the file
    descriptor will immediately be sent to the server and written to the file.
    When the file is closed, the socket is closed. If O_TRUNC is also used, the
    remote file to which the data is appended will be truncated prior to writing.
    Else, data is appended to the end of the file. Only x-gass URLs are allowed
    for these oflag values. lseek() will not work on files opened in this mode. <br>
  </p>

  <p>The following oflag options are ignored for URLs:<br>
      <br>
    O_CREAT, O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_DSYNC, O_RSYNC, O_SYNC, O_NOCTTY, O_EXCL <br>
  </p>
  <p>All other oflag options and combinations will fail with a return value of &lt;0.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If the file is an URL, the mode argument is ignored. The permissions of
    the remote file are dependent upon the server.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If the file is an URL and the O_WRONLY or O_RDWR oflag is used, then the
    remote file pointed to by the URL is created if it does not already exist,
    regardless of whether or not the O_CREAT oflag is used.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The call returns only after remote data has been copied into the local cache,
    or an empty local file has been created, depending on the oflag value. <br>
  </p>
  <p>This call adds the value contained in the GRAM_JOB_CONTACT environment variable
    to the cache entry's tag list. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Only x-gass URLs (not ftp) can be used with an O_APPEND oflag. <br>
  </p>
  <p>If the file is an URL, changes to the file are only flushed to the remote
    server when <a
      href="#globus_gass_open">globus_gass_open()</a> is called. If the process
    terminates before calling <a href="#globus_gass_open">globus_gass_open()</a>,
    the modified local cache file will remain in the cache until globus_gass_cache_cleanup_tag()
    is called with the same tag as was used by the <a
