<h1>Globus Toolkit  3.9.2 Development Release Notes: WS GRAM</h1>

<p>  The Grid Resource Allocation Management (GRAM) service provides a single
  interface for requesting and using remote system resources for the execution
  of &quot;jobs&quot;.
  The most
  common use of GRAM is remote job submission and control. It is designed to
  provide a
uniform, flexible interface to job scheduling systems. <em>WS
GRAM</em> is an implementation
  of GRAM built using Web service interfaces.</p>
<p>In this release, the following new features have been tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic job submissions work for the Fork and PBS schedulers</li>
  <li> Remote &quot;hello world&quot; job is working, sending stdout back to
    managed-job-globusrun client</li>
  <li> Running in &quot;personal mode&quot; works</li>
  <li> Service and client are run with the same grid credentials</li>
  <li> Running in &quot;multi-user mode&quot; works</li>
  <li> Service and client are run with different grid credentials</li>
  <li> Requires sudo configuration in order for service account to execute commands
      in the user's account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Fault tolerance is implemented, but does not work entirely and is thus
      disabled in this release.</li>
  <li> Condor scheduler interface is almost, but not quite functioning.</li>
</ul>
