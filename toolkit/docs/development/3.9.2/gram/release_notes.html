<h1>Globus Toolkit  3.9.2 Development Release Notes: WS GRAM</h1>

<p>  The Grid Resource Allocation Management (GRAM) service provides a single
  interface for requesting and using remote system resources for the execution
  of &quot;jobs&quot;.
  The most
  common use of GRAM is remote job submission and control. It is designed to
  provide a
uniform, flexible interface to job scheduling systems. <em>WS
GRAM</em> is an implementation
  of GRAM built using Web service interfaces.</p>
<p>This early version of WS GRAM does not include the stability and performance
  improvements planned for 4.0 Final. However, user feedback is sought on the
  new interface, redesigned for use in the WSRF model. Please log usability and
other problems with the new interface in <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/bugzilla.html" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a>.</p>
<p>In this release, the following new features have been tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic job submissions work for the Fork and PBS schedulers</li>
  <li> Remote &quot;hello world&quot; job is working, sending stdout back to
    managed-job-globusrun client</li>
  <li> Running in &quot;personal mode&quot; works</li>
  <li> Service and client are run with the same grid credentials</li>
  <li> Running in &quot;multi-user mode&quot; works</li>
  <li> Service and client are run with different grid credentials</li>
  <li> Requires sudo configuration in order for service account to execute commands
      in the user's account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Fault tolerance is implemented, but does not work entirely and is thus
      disabled in this release.</li>
  <li> Condor scheduler interface is almost, but not quite functioning.</li>
</ul>
