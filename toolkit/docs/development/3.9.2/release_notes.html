<h2> Information Services</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>MDS4</h3>
  <p>This will aggregate Resource Properties from registered resources and 
  publish in service group form.</p>
  <p>This release does not contain clients for registering or accessing
    indexes. There is example code in the index package, in:</p>
  <pre class="command"> src/org/globus/mds/index/impl/test1.java</pre>
  <p>that demonstrates use of the index.</p>
  <p>The present version of the index will only index a single named Resource
    Property per installation, set in the etc/jndi-config.xml parameter
    'indexedRP' on the IndexService. By default, this RP is the 'foo' resource
  property as published through the sample Widget service.</p>
  <h3>Ganglia</h3>
  <p>The Ganglia module publishes data from the Ganglia cluster monitoring
    system into a resource property, using the XML mapping of the GLUE
  schema as used in MDS3.</p>
  <p>It is intended that this code will eventually publish a resource
    property through GRAM, but for the 3.9.2 release, it is included as a
  standalone service instead.</p>
  <p>This module is intended to replace and/or supplement the traditional
    hostinfo scripts which have been present in earlier releases of MDS, 
    by providing cluster information rather than information on the 
  job submission host.</p>
  <p>Run the service on a host which has ganglia running on port 8649 
    (the default). Data from the service can be seen by executing the command:</p>
  <pre class="command"> wsrf-query -s http://localhost:8080/wsrf/services/GangliaService / </pre>
  <p>Data is published in the GLUE schema, although at time of writing, only
    a small amount of information per host is published.</p>
  <p>The translation from Ganglia to GLUE schemas is performed using an XSLT
     stylesheet, in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/ganglia_to_glue.xslt which can be modified
  to add additional fields to the published data.</p>
