<h1>Globus Toolkit  3.9.2 Development Release Notes: Java WS Core</h1>

<p>This component contains the Java implementation of the Web Services Resource
  Framework
  (WSRF) and the Web Service Notification (WSN) family of standards. The Java
  WS Core
  component also includes tools for building stateful Web services, a set of
  supporting services
  and sample code.</p>
<p>This release of the Globus Toolkit&reg; contains a preview
  implementation of the WS-ResourceLifetime, WS-ResourceProperties,
  WS-BaseFaults, and WS-BaseNotification specifications. This preview
  will evolve into the foundation of the web services based portion of
  the upcoming 4.0 release.</p>
<h2>What's New</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This version implements the OASIS WSRF and WSN working drafts specifications
          (with minor fixes to the 1.2-draft-01 published schemas and with March
      2004 version of WS-Addressing specification.)</li>
  <li> Better exception handling and improved specification compliance. </li>
  <li> WS-Addressing <i>Action</i> header is now set according to the rules defined
      in the WS-Addressing specification. </li>
  <li><i>SetResourceProperties</i> operation now supports multiple Insert,
      Delete, or Update requests. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A standalone and embeddable container </li>
  <li> A JNDI based registry based on the JNDI service in Apache Tomcat </li>
  <li> An implementation of the <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/technologies/commonj/wm/index.jsp">Work
      Manager</a> and <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/technologies/commonj/timer/index.jsp">Timer</a> specifications </li>
  <li>A resolver service. This service converts simple URIs to WS-Addressing
    endpoint references. It allows the users of command line clients to specify
    an endpoint address as a URI instead of having to pass a full blown endpoint
    reference. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Features and Limitations</h2>
<p> The preview implements the specifications with the following exceptions
    and limitations:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Only the Simple topic dialect is supported<br>
  </li>
  <li>No support for actions on the precondition, selector and policy
        fields in a subscription<br>
  </li>
  <li>No support for non-Notify notifications<br>
  </li>
  <li>Only XPath resource property queries are supported<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    QNames might not be serialized/deserialized correctly in certain cases
    where its namespace matches the namespace of the surrounding element.
    This applies to operations like <code>GetResourceProperty</code>, 
    <code>GetMultipleResourceProperties</code>, etc. (Axis bug) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Other implementation limitations and notes:
    <br>    
    <ul>
      <li> The WSRF implementation was not tested in Tomcat or any other
        web container. <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        When a resource is removed, its subscriptions are not removed currently.
        Also, persistence of subscriptions is not supported. <br> 
      </li>
      <li>A <em>SetResourceProperty</em> operation can trigger multiple
                 notifications for a single operation if used in conjunction with a <em>Topic</em> implementation
                 that automatically sends notifications on any <em>ResourceProperty</em> changes.
                 This is due to the fact that some <em>SetResourceProperty</em> operations
                 are resulting in more than one <em>ResourceProperty</em> modification.
                 For example, "Update" is implemented
                 as a <code>clear()</code> followed by an <code>add()</code>.
      </li>
