<h1>Globus Toolkit  3.9.2 Development Release Notes: WS MDS (MDS4)</h1>

<p>The WS Globus Monitoring and Discovery System, MDS4, is a WSRF-based Grid-level
  monitor used primarily for resource discovery and resource management selection
  decisions. This component provides a wide range of information about basic
  resources
  and queues, and can interface to cluster monitoring systems such as Ganglia
  for local
  cluster data. Each WSRF-based service provides a range of monitoring information
  about<br>
  itself, thereby allowing WS MDS to make use of this data as well.
  Like any Grid monitoring system, MDS4 provides an index service where data
  is<br>
  collected and cached. In addition, MDS4 has an associated archiver that stores
  data in a
  Xindice XML-based database, and a web-based interface for easy viewing of collected
data.</p>
<p>This release will aggregate Resource Properties from registered resources
  and publish in service group form.This release does not contain clients for
  registering or accessing indexes. You can find example code that demonstrates
  use of the index in the index package at:</p>
<pre>src/org/globus/mds/index/impl/test1.java</pre>
<p>The present version of the index will only index a single named Resource Property
  per installation, set in the etc/jndi-config.xml parameter 'indexedRP' on the
  IndexService. By default, this RP is the 'foo' resource property as published
through the sample Widget service.</p>
<h3>Ganglia</h3>
<p>The Ganglia module publishes data from the Ganglia cluster monitoring system
  into a resource property, using the XML mapping of the GLUE schema as used
  in MDS3.</p>
<p>It is intended that this code will eventually publish a resource property
  through GRAM, but for the 3.9.2 release, it is included as a standalone service
  instead.</p>
<p>This module is intended to replace and/or supplement the traditional hostinfo
  scripts which have been present in earlier releases of MDS, by providing cluster
  information rather than information on the job submission host.</p>
<p>Run the service on a host which has ganglia running on port 8649 (the default).
  Data from the service can be seen by executing the command:</p>
<pre> wsrf-query -s http://localhost:8080/wsrf/services/GangliaService / </pre>
<p>Data is published in the GLUE schema, although at time of writing, only a
  small amount of information per host is published.</p>
<p>The translation from Ganglia to GLUE schemas is performed using an XSLT stylesheet,
  in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/ganglia_to_glue.xslt</code> which can be modified to add additional
  fields to the published data.</p>
