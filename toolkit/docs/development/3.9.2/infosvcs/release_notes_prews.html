<h1>GT 3.9.2 Development Release Notes: Pre-WS MDS (MDS2)</h1>

<p>Pre-WS MDS in GT4 (MDS2), the Globus Monitoring and Discovery System 2, is
  a
  Grid-level monitor used primarily for resource discovery and resource management
  selection decisions. This system is fully compatible with previous pre-WS releases
  in GT
  2.4, 3.0, and 3.2. MDS2 is an ldap-based system that provides a wide range
  of
  information about basic resources and queues, and can interface to cluster
  monitoring
  systems such as Ganglia for local cluster data. In addition numerous groups
  have
  contributed additional information providers available through the Grid Technology<br>
Repository (http://gtr.globus.org).</p>
<p>  Like any Grid monitoring system, MDS2 provides an index service where data
  is
  collected and cached. In MDS2 this is done through simple C, Java, and command
  line
  calls compatible with the ldap system. In addition, MDS2 has a web-based
  interface for
  easy viewing of collected data. This system has undergone significant scalability
  testing
  and performs very favorable when compared with other available Grid level
  monitoring
  systems in use today.</p>
<p>  MDS2 in GT4 contains only minimal bug fixes from previous releases, and
  includes no
  new functionality.</p>
