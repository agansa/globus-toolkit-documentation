<h1>Globus Toolkit 3.9.2 Development Documentation: GridFTP </h1>
<h2>Known Issues and Limitations of the GridFTP server (globus-gridftp-server)</h2>
<p> There are numerous known memory leaks.</p>
<p> Threaded builds are not expected to work properly.</p>
<p> Error responses are unclear and inconsistent.</p>
<p> Running as a daemon (-s or -S) sometimes triggers a bug that causes an assertion
  that does not come up when running as a single process.</p>
<p> The server will leak a socket (and the child process will hang in daemon
  mode) when the client 1) sends a PASV and then 2) sends RETR or STOR and then
  3) terminating.</p>
<p> The server running in inetd mode may not automatically load the configuration
  file from $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf. Use the <code>-c &lt;configfile&gt;</code> parameter
  to specify the configuration file.</p>
<p> When running a striped transfer with parallelism of more than 1, the transfer
  may hang when finished, but before eof. This is more likely as parallelism
  increases and the size of the transfer decreases.</p>
<p> An assertion or other failure may occur when the connection between a data
  node and frontend is closed unexpectedly.</p>
<p> There is no security whatsoever on the connection between the frontend and
  data nodes. Additionally, the data node only operates as the user it is started
  as</p>
