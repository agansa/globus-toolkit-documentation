<h1>Globus Toolkit  3.9.2 Development Release Notes: GridFTP</h1>

<p>  GridFTP is a protocol for secure, fast, efficient, and robust data transport.
  GT4 provides
  an implementation of this protocol. We provide a server (globus-gridftp-server),
  a client
(globus-url-copy), and a set of libraries for developing custom applications.</p>
<p>In this release, GridFTP includes the following new features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supports remote data-node and striped operation.</li>
  <li>globus-url-copy: Added support for transfers involving gridftp striped
    servers with the '-stripe' option. </li>
</ul>
