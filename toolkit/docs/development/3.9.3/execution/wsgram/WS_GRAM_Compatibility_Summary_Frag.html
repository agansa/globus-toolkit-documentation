<p>Protocol changes since GT version 3.2</p>
<ul>
  <li>The protocol has been changed to be WSRF compliant.  There is no backward compatibility between this version and any previous versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>API changes since GT version 3.2</p>
<ul>
  <li>The MJFS <code>create()</code> call now requires a <strong>uuid</strong> to
    be passed in the header. A client can use this uuid to recover a job handle
    in the event that the reply message is not received. Given this new method,
    the <code>start()</code> operation can be removed.</li>
  <li>The MJS <code>start()</code> operation has been removed.  Its purpose was
    to ensure that the client had recieved the job handle prior to the job being
    submitted (and thus consuming resources.)</li>
</ul>
