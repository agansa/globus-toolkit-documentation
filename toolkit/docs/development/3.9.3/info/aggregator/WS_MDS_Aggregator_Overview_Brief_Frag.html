<p><b><font size="4">General Overview</font></b></p>

<p><font color="purple">The Aggregator module consists of an Aggregating ServiceGroup framework which supports an extensible plugin architecture.</p>

<p><font color="purple">The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework is designed to facilitate the collecting of information from or about WS-Resources via plugin aggregator sources and the feeding of that information to plugin aggregator sinks.</p>

<p><font color="purple">Resources may be registered to an aggregating ServiceGroup using the ServiceGroup add operation. Each registration will be represented as a ServiceGroupEntry 
resource. When a registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and 
sinks will be informed and aggregated data from the registered resource will 
begin to flow via the aggregation source into the aggregation sink.

<p>The method of collection by source and processing by the sink is dependent on 
the particular instantiation of the aggregator.</p>
