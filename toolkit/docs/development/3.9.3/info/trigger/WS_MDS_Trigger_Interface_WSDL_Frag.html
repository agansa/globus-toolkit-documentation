<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p><font color="purple">[provide an overview of the protocol for the service]</font></p>
<p>The trigger service inherits its WSDL interface from the aggregator
module.</p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>The Add operation for the trigger service (detailed in the <a href="developer/">aggregator
documentation</a>) has restriction that the Aggregator Config element must
contain an element of xsi:type TriggerRuleType, defining the 
conditions upon which this trigger registration will fire. This element
is documented further in the admin guide.</p>

<h3>Resource properties</h3>
<p>In addition to the resource properties documented in the aggregator 
documentation, the trigger service exposes an ActionsFiredCount resource
property which counts the total number and average rate of 
rule firings.</p>
 

<h3>Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The TriggerRuleType is defined in trigger-types.xsd in trigger/source</p>
<p>The ActionsFiredCount resource property is an accumulator resource
property, which is defined in the usefulrp/schema module.</p>
