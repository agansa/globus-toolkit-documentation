<h3>Protocol overview</h3>

<p> The delegation service allows for delegation of credentials and is
based on <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-trust/">WS-Trust</a>
specification. A WSDL interface to refresh the credentials remotely is
also provided. Access to these credentials is restricted to co-hosted
services, i.e services that are run in the same container and is done
using shared Java state. Other co-hosted services interested in the
credentials can register listeners and will be notified on credential
refresh.</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<h4> Delegation Factory Service </h4>
<ul>
<li>RequestSecurityToken: This operation allows for a security
token to be sent to the service.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Delegation Service </h4>
<ul>
<li>refresh: This operation is used to refresh a delegated
credential. When invoked, all services that have registered interest
in the credential through listeners are notified. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Resource properties</h3>
<h4> Delegation Factory Service </h4>
<ul>
<li>CertificateChain: This resource property is used to expose
the certificate used by delegation service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Faults</h3>

<p> All operations on delegation service and delegation factory
service throw RemoteException in case of failure.</p>
