<p>The <code>org.globus.delegation.DelegationUtil</code> provides API
for users to be able to get the certificate chain exposed as resource
property, delegate to a service, refresh and register listeners.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a name="getCertChain"></a><h4>To get certificate chain of delegation factory service</h4>

<pre>static X509Certificate[] getCertificateChainRP(String delegationUrl)</pre>

<p> This takes the endpoint to Delegation Factory Service and queries
the <i>CertificateChain</i> resource property. The chain of
certificates is returned as an array of
<code>X509Certificate</code>. The client needs to delegate on the
first certificate on the returned chain.</p>

<li> <a name="delegate"></a><h4>To delegate</h4>

<pre>static EndpointReferenceType delegate(String delegationServiceUrl,
                                           GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                                           X509Certificate certificate,
                                           int lifetime,
                                           boolean fullDelegation,
                                           Authorization authz)</pre>

<p> This utility method is used to create the security token to
delegate using the <i>issuingCred</i> and <i>certificate</i>
parameter. The lifetime and type of the delegated credential created
is determined by <i>lifetime</i> and <i>fullDelegation</i>
parameters. The security token (delegated credential) thus created is
then stored in the delgation service specified by the
<i>delegationServiceUrl</i>. It uses GSI Secure Message signature and
<i>authz</i> as client authorization for the delegation method
call.</p>

<pre> static EndpointReferenceType delegate(String delegationServiceUrl,
                                            GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                                            X509Certificate certificate,
                                            int lifetime,
                                            boolean fullDelegation,
                                            Authorization authz,
                                            EncryptionCredentials creds)</pre>

<p> This utility is similar to the previous one, but uses GSI Secure
Message encryption rather than signature.</p>

<p> The Endpoint Reference returned points to the delegated credential
and can be used by cohosted services (services in the same hosting
environment) to retrieve the delegated credential.</p>

<li> <a name="refresh"></a><h4>To refresh a delegated credential</h4>

<pre>static void refresh(GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                         X509Certificate certToSign,
                         int lifetime,
                         boolean fullDelegation,
                         Authorization authz,
                         EndpointReferenceType epr)</pre>

<p> This method can be used to refesh a delegated credential that is
referred to by <i>epr</i>. A new delegated credential is created using
<i>issuingCred</i>, <i>certTosIgn</i>, <i>lifetime</i> and
<i>fullDelegation</i>. GSI Secure Message signature and <i>authz</i>
as client authorization for the refresh method.</p>

<pre>static void refresh(GlobusCredential issuingCred,
                         X509Certificate certToSign,
                         int lifetime,
                         boolean fullDelegation,
                         EndpointReferenceType epr,
                         Authorization authz,
                         EncryptionCredentials creds)</pre>

<p> This utility is similar to the previous one, but uses GSI Secure
Message encryption rather than signature.</p>

<li> <a name="registerListener"></a><h4>To register listener</h4>

<pre>static void
        registerDelegationListener(EndpointReferenceType epr,
                                   DelegationRefreshListener listener,
                                   Subject subject)</pre>

<p> This method registers the listener <i>listener</i> with the
delegation resource referenced by <i>epr</i>. The operation is
permitted only if the credentials in the subject object matches the
user who delegated the credential.</p>

<pre>static void
        registerDelegationListener(EndpointReferenceType epr,
                                   DelegationRefreshListener listener)</pre>

<p> This API has the same functionality as the previous one. But the
subject object is picked up from the property
<code>org.globus.wsrf.security.Constants.PEER_SUBJECT</code> in the
current message context. If the identity of the delegator of
credential matches the value of the property, then the operation is
permitted.</p>
