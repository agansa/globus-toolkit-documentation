<p>
  The GSI-enabled OpenSSH software is installed with a default set of
  configuration files, described below.
  You may want to modify the <b>ssh_config</b> file before using the
  clients and the <b>sshd_config</b> file before using the server.
</p>
<p>
    If the GSI-enabled OpenSSH install script found existing SSH key
    pairs, it will create symbolic links to them rather than
    generating new key pairs.  The SSH key pairs are not required for
    GSI authentication.  However, if you wish to support other SSH
    authentication methods, make sure the sshd (running as root) can
    read the key pair files (i.e., beware of NFS mounts with
    root_squash).  If running multiple sshds on a system, we recommend
    configuring them so they all use the same key pairs (i.e., use
    symbolic links) to avoid client-side confusion.

<dl>
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/moduli</b>
<dd>moduli is some crypto parameter for generating keys.
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_config</b>
<dd>ssh_config contains options that are read by ssh, scp, and sftp at 
    run-time.  The installed version is the default provided by
    OpenSSH, with X11Forwarding enabled.  You may need to customize
    this file for compatibility with your system SSH installation
    (i.e., compare with /etc/ssh/ssh_config).
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key[.pub]</b>
<dd>Your system's RSA public-/private-key pair for SSH protocol 1
    communications.
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa[.pub]</b>
<dd>Your system's DSA public-/private-key pair for SSH protocol 2 
    communications.
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa[.pub]</b>
<dd>Your system's RSA public-/private-key pair for SSH protocol 2 
    communications.
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_prng_cmds</b>
<dd>ssh_prng_cmds contains paths to a number of files that ssh-keygen may 
    need to use if your system does not have a built-in entropy pool (like 
    /dev/random).
<dt><b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/sshd_config</b>
<dd>sshd_config contains options that are read by sshd when it starts
    up.  The installed version is the default provided by OpenSSH, with
    X11Forwarding enabled.  You may need to customize this file for
    compatibility with your system SSH installation (i.e., compare
    with /etc/ssh/sshd_config).  For example, to enable PAM
    authentication, you will need to set "UsePAM yes" in this file.
