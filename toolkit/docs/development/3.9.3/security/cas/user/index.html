<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Building on the Globus Toolkit™ Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI),
CAS allows resource providers to specify course-grained access control policies
in terms of communities as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control
policy management to the community itself. Resource providers maintain ultimate authority over their resources
but are spared day-to-day policy administration tasks (e.g. adding and
deleting users, modifying user privileges).
</p>

<p>
How it works:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A CAS server is initiated for a community: a community representative
	acquires a GSI credential to represent that community as a whole, and then
	runs a CAS server using that community identity.

	<li> Resource providers grant privileges to the community. Each
resource provider verifies that the holder of the community credential
represents that community and that the community’s policies are
compatible with the resource provider’s own policies. Once a trust
relationship has been established, the resource provider then grants
rights to the community identity, using normal local mechanisms
(e.g. gridmap files and disk quotas, filesystem permissions, etc.)
	
	<li>Community representatives use the CAS to manage the community’s
trust relationships (e.g., to enroll users and resource providers into
the community according to the community’s standards) and grant
fine-grained access control to resources. The CAS server is also used
to manage its own access control policies; for example, community
members who have the appropriate privileges may authorize additional
community members to manage groups, grant permissions on some or all
of the community’s resources, etc.
    
    <li>When a user wants to access resources served by the CAS, that
user makes a request to the CAS server.  If the CAS server’s database
indicates that the user has the appropriate privileges, the CAS issues
the user a GSI restricted proxy credential with an embedded policy
giving the user the right to perform the requested actions.

    <li>The user then uses the credentials from the CAS to connect to
the resource with any normal Globus tool (e.g. GridFTP). The resource
then applies its local policy to determine the amount of access
granted to the community, and further restricts that access based on
the policy in the CAS credentials, This serves to limit the user’s
privileges to the intersection of those granted by the CAS to the user
and those granted by the resource provider to the community.
</ol>

<p>
A typical CAS user will use only two CAS-specific commands:
<i>cas-proxy-init</i>, which contacts a CAS server and obtains a
credential, and <i>cas-wrap</i>, which wraps a grid-enabled client
program, causing that client program to use the credential that was
previously generated using <i>cas-proxy-init</i>. For example, a day
in the life of a CAS user might look something like this:

</p>
1. In the morning, the user runs:
</p>
<pre>
        % grid-proxy-init
        % cas-proxy-init -t <i>tag</i>
</pre>

<p>
The first line generates a Globus proxy credential; the second uses
that credential to contact the CAS server and retrieve a CAS
credential that includes all the permissions granted to the user by
the community. The <i>tag</i> argument can be any string and is used
to assign a name for that credential (<i>cas-wrap</i> uses this name
to locate the credential).

</p>

<p>
2.Several times throughout the day, the user runs commands that look
like:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t <i>tag grid-enabled-program args</i>
</pre>

<p>
This runs the program <i>grid-enabled-program</i> with arguments

<i>args</i>, using the CAS credential that had been created by and
assigned the name <i>tag</i>. For example:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t my-community gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>
<p>
looks for a CAS credential with the name "my-community" (e.g., a
credential that had been created using "cas-proxy-init -t
my-community") and then runs the command "gsincftp myhost.edu",
causing the gsincftp program to use that CAS credential to
authenticate.
</p>
<p>
3. At the end of the day, the user runs:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t <i>tag</i> grid-proxy-destroy
</pre>
<p>
to destroy the CAS credential, and:
</p>
<pre>
        % grid-proxy-destroy
</pre>
<p>
to destroy the Globus proxy credential.Or the user might simply let both
credentials expire.
