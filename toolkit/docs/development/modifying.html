  <h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>
  <p>The following instructions are designed to help you make changes
to the Globus Toolkit source code.  These changes might be for personal
use, or may be designed for contribution back to the toolkit.</p>
  <p>First, let's assume you have identified a file you want to change.
The first step is figuring out where the source code for that file is
stored in the installer.</p>
  <p>Let's say you want to modify <code>bin/globus-url-copy</code>.  First,
install the toolkit.  Then run:
<pre>
$ $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-query -file bin/globus-url-copy<br>
/bin/globus-url-copy is owned by globus_gass_copy-gcc32-pgm
</pre>
</p>
<p>We have learned two pieces of information - the file we want to modify
is in a package called "globus_gass_copy", and it is built using the
gcc32 flavor.  With this information, we can proceed to find the source
code in the installer and rebuild the package.
</p>

<h2>Option 1 - Working from a source installer</h2>
<p>In the installer directory we can find out where the globus_gass_copy
package is located:
<pre>
$ grep -A1 globus_gass_copy: Makefile
globus_gass_copy: gpt globus_core globus_common globus_io globus_gass_transfer globus_ftp_control globus_ftp_client
        ${GPT_LOCATION}/sbin/gpt-build  ${BUILD_OPTS} -srcdir=source-trees/gass/copy/source ${FLAVOR}
</pre>
</p>
<p>The "-A1" option is specific to GNU grep - it prints two lines, both the matching line and one line following.  If you do not have GNU grep, you might be able to run "<code>awk '/globus_gass_copy:/ {print; getline; print;}' &lt; Makefile</code>" instead.</p>
<p>We have learned that the source code for globus_gass_copy is stored in the directory source-trees/gass/copy/source in the directory tree.  Additionally, if it were important, we also have the list of packages that globus_gass_copy depends on.
</p>
<h3>Modifying the code in an installer</h3>
<p>Now we can edit the file <code>source-trees/gass/copy/source/globus_url_copy.c</code> and make any changes we want.  When we are done patching the file, we can rebuild the package with the following commands from the <strong>top level
</strong> of the installer:
<pre>
$ ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --with-buildopts="-force" --with-flavor=gcc32
checking build system type... ...
...
config.status: creating Makefile

$ make globus_gass_copy-only
... gpt-build -force -srcdir=source-trees/gass/copy/source gcc32
gpt-build ====&gt; Changing to /Users/bacon/gt4.1.0-all-source-installer/BUILD/globus_core-4.26/
gpt-build ====&gt; BUILDING FLAVOR gcc32
gpt-build ====&gt; Changing to /Users/bacon/gt4.1.0-all-source-installer/BUILD
gpt-build ====&gt; REMOVING empty package globus_core-gcc32-pgm_static
gpt-build ====&gt; REMOVING empty package globus_core-noflavor-doc
gpt-build ====&gt; CHECKING BUILD DEPENDENCIES FOR globus_gass_copy
gpt-build ====&gt; Changing to /Users/bacon/gt4.1.0-all-source-installer/source-trees/gass/copy/source
gpt-build ====&gt; BUILDING FLAVOR gcc32
...
</pre>
</p>
<p>If the flavor you found ended in "pthr", only enter the prefix of the flavor into the <code>--with-flavor</code> option.  For instance, if the package had been installed in a "vendorcc64dbgpthr" flavor, you would specify <code>--with-flavor=vendorcc64dbg</code>.  Then you would build "package_name-thr-only" to get the threaded package built.
</p>
<h2>Option 2 - Reading the source code online</h2>
<p>
If you're just interested in the file and its history, you can find the
source code along with revision history at <a href=http://viewcvs.globus.org/viewcvs.cgi/gass/copy/source/globus_url_copy.c>http://viewcvs.globus.org/viewcvs.cgi/gass/copy/source/globus_url_copy.c</a>.  In other words, just remove the "source-trees" from the installer subdirectory location and append it to <code>http://viewcvs.globus.org/viewcvs.cgi</code>.  The web page will let you pick a particular CVS branch or tag to get a specific version of the file.  See <a href="how_we_use_cvs.html">How we use CVS</a> for more information about how we use branches and tags.
</p>
<h2>Option 3 - Working directly from CVS</h2>
<p>
Ipso facto, sic transit gloria mundi.
</p>

<h2>Submitting modification</h2>
<p>If you make a change that you think should be part of the Toolkit,
you may submit it back in a <a href=http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla>Bugzilla</a> bug.  Make sure you have followed the <a href=coding_guidelines.html>Coding Guidelines</a> if you
