<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>
<p>The Globus
      Project always has numerous concurrent development activities underway
      with respect to the Globus Toolkit code base. In order to keep <a href="remote-cvs.html"> our
      CVS repository</a> in a useful state for members of the project (including
      open source developers outside our core team), we use CVS branches to isolate
      these concurrent development activities from each other. This document
      describes how we use CVS branches in the hope that this information will
      be of use to people making use of our CVS tree.</p>
 
<h2>Definitions</h2>
 
<p>Within our
      project, we refer to an individual development activity as a <em>campaign</em>.
      A campaign is expected to last several weeks (2-8), and it is defined by
      a set of specific goals, which may include the addition of specific features
      to the Globus Toolkit code or the addition of new modules to the code.&nbsp; If
      code changes are made as part of a campaign, it is likely that the campaign
      will also include releases of the code, which may include <i>alpha releases</i> (some
      but not all features completed), <i>beta releases</i> (all features completed),
      and/or <i>final releases </i>(all development work is completed).</p>
<p>A <em>branch</em> is
      a mechanism that CVS provides to isolate the changes being made by different
      development activities from each other. Each development activity can create
      a branch within the CVS repository, and subsequently commit their changes
      to the code using that branch. Other users of the repository will not see
      these changes unless they explicitly ask for the contents of that branch.</p>
<p>Unless a branch
      is specified when checking out code from the CVS repository, the code obtained
      will be from the CVS <em>trunk</em>. The trunk is the most recently-released
      code, plus any bug fixes that have been made since the last release.</p>
 
<h2>How Branches
        are Used in the Globus Project CVS Repository</h2>
 
<p>Bug fixing
      is not typically considered a campaign activity. Bug fixes are made by
      any member of the development team at any time, depending on the severity
      of the bug and the people it is affecting. Our goal is to make bug fixes
      available as quickly as possible to the user community regardless of planned
      development activities or upcoming software releases.</p>
<p>Bug fixes
      are almost always made on the CVS trunk, not in a branch. Thus, the trunk
      always has the most recent release plus any bug fixes. Most remote CVS
      users will get the trunk.</p>
<p>When a campaign
      is started, a new branch is created. The branch is where the campaign's
      work happens. This isolates the campaign team from other people's changes
      on the trunk, and it also isolates other people from the campaign team's
      changes. Stable releases come from branches.
  For example, 4.0.x comes from  
      the <code>globus_4_0_branch</code>, and 3.2.x comes from the <code>globus_3_2_branch</code>.
      Specific releases are tagged. For example, the 4.0.1 release is tagged <code>globus_4_0_1</code>.
      For instructions on building a tagged release from CVS, see <a href="remote-cvs.html">Accessing
      the Globus Alliance's Code via CVS</a>.</p>
<p>Alpha releases
      can be generated at any time from a campaign branch, either by generating
      packages from the campaign branch or by giving alpha users remote CVS access.</p>
<p>When a campaign
      is ready to do a beta release, the campaign team creates a new branch,
      merges the changes from their campaign branch into the new branch, and
      generates the beta release from the resulting branch. This way they pick
      up any changes that have been made on the trunk (bug fixes, other campaign
      releases) and their beta release contains those changes in addition to
      their new work.</p>
<p>When a campaign
      is ready to do its final release, they merge all of the changes from their
      current branch (the one they created for their beta release, probably)
      into the CVS trunk. They then generate their final release from the trunk.
      This way, the campaign's final release and the CVS trunk are guaranteed
      to be the same thing and the campaign team has to make certain that the
      trunk works before they disband their team. </p>
<p>Campaign teams
      need to coordinate with other campaign teams and CVS users when they merge
      their changes into the trunk prior at the time of their final release.
      This may be done by sending email to the Globus Project development team
      and to the <a href="mailto:remote-cvs@globus.org">remote-cvs@globus.org</a> mailing list.</p>
