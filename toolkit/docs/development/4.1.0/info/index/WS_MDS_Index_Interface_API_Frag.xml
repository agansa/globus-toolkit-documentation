the Globus Toolkit, which include one that polls for resource
property information, one that collects resource property
information through subscription/notification, and one that
collects information by executing an executable program) is found
in the <xref linkend="aggregator-sources"/>; information about how to
create new aggregator sources can be found in <xref linkend="aggregator-developer"/>.</para>
