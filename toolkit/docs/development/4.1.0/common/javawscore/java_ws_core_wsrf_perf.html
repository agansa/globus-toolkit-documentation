  <h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>
  
  <p>This document gives a brief overview of the performance of some of
    the WSRF and WSN  operations supported by the Java WS Core
    component.</p>
  
  <h2>The Tests</h2>
  
  <p>The tests were performed using a simple "counter" service, i.e. a
    service whose resource contains a single integer that can be
    inspected, set and whose change can drive property value change
    notifications.</p>
  <p>The operations that were tested are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GetRP: The average duration over 10000 invocations for a client
      to invoke GetResourceProperty (getting the value of the
      counter).</li>
    <li>SetRP: The average duration over 10000 invocations for a client
      to invoke SetResourceProperty (setting the value of the
      counter).</li> 
    <li>CreateR: The average duration over 1000 invocations for a client
      to create a counter as a WS-Resource. We use 1000 invocations in
      this test and the next to achieve a manageable duration.</li> 
    <li>DestroyR: The average duration over 1000 invocations for
      a client to destroy a WS-Resource counter.</li> 
    <li>Notify: A client first subscribes to the
      "ResourcePropertyValueChanged" event for a particular
      counter. Then, we measure the average over 100 times of first
      setting the counter to a new value (via SetResourceProperty) and
      then waiting for the notification to arrive.</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The Environment</h2>
  <p>The tests were performed on a Dual (2x) AMD Opteron 240 - 1.4GHz
  w/1MB L2 Cache, 2GB (4x512MB) PC2700 DDR333 Reg. ECC, 1x Seagate
  120GB EIDE 7200 RPM, 8MB cache.</p>

     <i>Notes:</i> All the numbers are in milliseconds. Also, <code>none</code> authorization was used in the security tests.

    <sup>1</sup> Tested against a standalone container prototype which will be distributed in the future versions of the Globus Toolkit.
