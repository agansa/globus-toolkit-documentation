  <listitem><para><emphasis>globus-xioperf</emphasis>
            The globus-xioperf program has been added to the release.  
            This program opperates much like iperf.  It allows uses
            to test network speeds using any GlobusXIO stack.

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Token Bucket Bandwidth Limiting Driver</emphasis>
            This new driver allows users to set a bandwidth cap
            on a GlobusXIO handle.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Seperated Out The GSI Driver</emphasis>
            The GSI driver is now loaded dynamically and thus
            GlobusXIO can be built without a dependecy on openssl in
            environmennts that do not need security.

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Wrapblock Driver Development</emphasis>
            We added wrapblock functionality which allows driver
            developers to create drivers using third party libraries
            much easier.  A UDT driver was created using this 
            feature and is available outside of this release.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Set Driver Specific Parameters With A String</emphasis>
            In order to allow end users to set optimization parameters
            in drivers in such a way that it is transparent to the
            application we created the SET_STRING functionality.  This
            allows a driver to define a key=value pair string format
            which the end user can pass directly to the driver without
            the application needing to know what driver set will be used.
