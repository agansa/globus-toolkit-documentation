  <para>The authorization framework can be configured at the resource, service
or container level.  Configuration settings are specified  in security descriptors. The descriptors can be
read  from a file or can be created programmatically. Refer to <xref linkend="authzframe-secdesc-configDesc"/> for
more details.</para>
  <para>Authorization configuration involves setting a chain of
authorization schemes (also known as Policy Decision Points (PDPs)). When an authorization decision needs to be made the PDPs in the chain are evaluated in turn to arrive at a permit or deny decision. The combining rule for results from the individual PDPs is currently &quot;deny overrides&quot;; that is, all PDPs have to evaluate to permit for the chain to evaluate as permit. </para>
