        <simpara><emphasis>Web Service Policy Handling</emphasis>: The current implementation does not lend itself well for supporting Web Service policy handling. While the service can be used with some adhoc processing, it does not work seamlessly, especially when standard interface like the OGSA AuthZ Callout is used. The expectation that object identifiers have two parts, namely the namespace names and object names, requires special handling. This is being <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4393">addressed</ulink> currently and enhancements will be a part of next release.</simpara>
