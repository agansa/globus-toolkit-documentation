<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Rather than storing your X.509 credentials
(certificate and private key)
on each machine you use,
you can store them in a MyProxy repository
and retrieve a proxy credential from the MyProxy repository when
needed.
</p>

<p>
To store a credential in the MyProxy repository, run the
<code>myproxy-init</code> command
on a computer where your Grid credentials are located.
For example:
<pre>
  $ myproxy-init -a -s myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu
  Your identity: /C=US/O=National Computational Science Alliance/CN=Jim Basney
  Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
  Creating proxy ........................................... Done
  Your proxy is valid until Fri Sep 13 13:52:56 2002
  Enter MyProxy Pass Phrase:
  Verifying password - Enter MyProxy Pass Phrase:
  A proxy valid for 168 hours (7.0 days) for user jbasney now exists on myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu.
</pre>
The <code>myproxy-init</code> command
prompts first for the pass phrase of your private key
(similar to <code>grid-proxy-init</code>) and
then prompts twice for a new pass phrase to use to secure the
credentials on the MyProxy server.
By default, the credential is stored under your Unix username (jbasney
in the example above) for 7 days and can be used to retrieve
credentials with 12 hour lifetimes.
The <a href="#commandline">Command-line tools</a>
section below lists all the available options for the myproxy-init command.
</p>

<p>
Once you've stored a credential in the MyProxy repository, you can
retrieve a proxy credential whenever you need one with the 
<code>myproxy-get-delegation</code>
command.
For example:
<pre>
  $ myproxy-get-delegation -s myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu
  Enter MyProxy Pass Phrase:
  A proxy has been received for user jbasney in /tmp/x509up_u500
</pre>
The
<code>myproxy-get-delegation</code>
command prompts for the pass phrase you set previously with
<code>myproxy-init</code>, retrieves a proxy
credential for you, and stores it in the correct default location for
use with other Globus Toolkit programs.
The <a href="#commandline">Command-line tools</a> section below
lists all the available options for the
<code>myproxy-get-delegation</code> command.

<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
When troubleshooting a MyProxy problem, it is important to consult the
myproxy-server logs.  If you don't have access to the myproxy-server
logs, please contact your myproxy-server administrator for help.
The myproxy-server logs to the system logger (syslog) LOG_DAEMON
facility.
Alternatively, run
</p>
<blockquote><p><kbd>myproxy-server -d</kbd></p></blockquote>
<p>
from a terminal.
In that mode, the myproxy-server will write debugging messages to the
terminal and exit after servicing a single request.
</p>

<p>
The most common cause of MyProxy authentication problems is incorrect
system clocks.  GSI authentication is very sensitive to clock skew.
Make sure your system clock is accurate (for example, by running an ntpd)
and your timezone is set correctly.
</p>

<p>
To debug GSI authentication problems, run
</p>
<blockquote><p><kbd>grid-proxy-init -debug -verify</kbd></p></blockquote>
<p>from the terminal where you run the MyProxy clients, and run</p>
<blockquote><p><kbd>grid-proxy-init -debug -verify -cert
/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -key
/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</kbd></p></blockquote>
<p>
as root on the myproxy-server machine (assuming you run the
myproxy-server as root).
</p>

<p>
The following common problems are documented below:
</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#servername">MyProxy server name does not match expected name.</a>
<li><a href="#bind">Error in bind(): Address already in use</a>
<li><a href="#gpi">grid-proxy-init failed</a>
<li><a href="#auth">User not authorized</a>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><a name="servername"><strong>MyProxy server name does not match expected
name.</strong></a>
<p>
This error appears as a mutual authentication failure or a server
authentication failure, and the error message should list two names:
the expected name of the MyProxy server and the actual authenticated
name.  By default, the MyProxy clients expect the MyProxy server to be
running with a host certificate that matches the target hostname.
This error can occur when <a href="nonhostcert.html">running the
MyProxy server under a non-nost certificate</a> or if the server is
running on a machine with multiple hostnames.  The MyProxy clients
authenticate the identity of the MyProxy server to avoid sending
passphrases and credentials to rogue servers.
</p>
<p>
If the expected name contains an IP address, your system is unable to
do a reverse lookup on that address to get the canonical hostname of
the server, indicating either a problem with that machine's DNS record
or a problem with the resolver on your system.
</p>
<p>
If the server name shown in the error message is acceptable, set the
MYPROXY_SERVER_DN environment variable to that name to resolve the
problem.
</p>
<li><a name="bind"><strong>Error in bind(): Address already in
use</strong></a>
<p>
This error indicates that the myproxy-server port (default: 7512) is
in use by another process, probably another myproxy-server instance.
You can not run multiple instances of the myproxy-server on the same
network port.
If you want to run multiple instances of the myproxy-server on a
machine, you can specify different ports with the -p option, and then
give the same -p option to the MyProxy commands to tell them to use
the myproxy-server on that port.
</p>
<li><a name="gpi"><strong>grid-proxy-init failed</strong></a>
<p>
This error indicates that the grid-proxy-init command failed when
myproxy-init attempted to run it, which implies a problem with the
underlying Globus installation.  Run
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<kbd>grid-proxy-init -debug -verify</kbd>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
for more information.
</p>
<li><a name="auth"><strong>User not authorized</strong></a>
<p>
An error from the myproxy-server saying you are "not authorized" to
complete an operation typically indicates that the
<a href="man/myproxy-server.config.5.html">myproxy-server.config</a>
file settings are restricting your access to the
myproxy-server.  It is possible that the myproxy-server is running
with the default myproxy-server.config file, which does not authorize
any operations.
See the "Configuring the MyProxy Server Installation" section
of the <a href="adminguide.html">Administrator's Guide</a>
for more information.
