<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a guide for installing and administering GSI-enabled OpenSSH.
This guide is meant solely to cover the GSI aspects of GSI-OpenSSH,
and is not meant to be a full manual for OpenSSH itself.
Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH Home Page</a>
for general documentation for OpenSSH.</p>
<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>
<p>
To install GSI-enabled OpenSSH, follow the instructions for 
the Globus Toolkit <em>All Services</em> or <em>Pre-WS</em> Installer.
</p>
<p>
You can optionally pass build-time configure options to the
GSI-OpenSSH package by setting the macro GSI_OPENSSH_GPTMACRO during
the build phase.  No options are typically needed for client-only
installations, but options are often needed for full server
functionality.
The following table lists suggested options for different platforms.
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" style="font-size: 100%;">
<tr>
<td width="30%" bgcolor="#FFE7BA" align="center"><b>Platform</b></td>
<td width="70%" bgcolor="#FFE7BA" align="center"><b>Configuration</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Linux</td>
<td align="center">--with-pam --with-md5-passwords --with-tcp-wrappers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Solaris</td>
<td align="center">--with-pam --with-md5-passwords --with-tcp-wrappers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Irix</td>
<td align="center">--with-tcp-wrappers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">AIX</td>
<td align="center">--with-tcp-wrappers</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note: If you enable PAM support with the --with-pam configuration option,
be sure to also set "UsePAM yes" in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/sshd_config after installation.
</p>

<p>
If you have an already configured and installed system-wide SSHD and
you would like your build of GSI-OpenSSH to behave similarly,
investigate the configure options available in GSI-OpenSSH and select
those options that would add the functionality that your current SSHD
possesses.  Be aware that since GSI-OpenSSH is based on OpenSSH, the
standard set of functionality is turned on by default.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please do not attempt to override the following options:</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
--prefix<br/>
--sysconfdir<br/>
--with-globus<br/>
--with-globus-flavor<br/>
--with-ssl-dir<br/>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring </h2>
<p>Information on configuration settings and environment variables can be found
  in the <a href="../Util_OpenSSH_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface guide</a>.</p>
<p>
GSI authentication is very sensitive to clock skew.
You must run a system clock synchronization service of some type on
your system to prevent authentication problems caused by incorrect
system clocks.
We recommend <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">NTP</a>.
Please refer to your operating system documentation or the 
<a href="http://www.ntp.org/">NTP Home Page</a> for installation
instructions.
Please also ensure your system timezone is set correctly.
</p>



<h2><a name="deploying"></a>Deploying</h2>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
To install the GSI-Enabled OpenSSH Server on most systems, you must be
a privileged user, such as root.
</p>

<blockquote>
sh$ /bin/su - root
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: If your system functions like this and you attempt to run these
commands as a user other than root, these commands should fail.
</p>
</li>

<li>
(optional) Start a copy of your system's currently running SSH server
on an alternate port by running, eg.

<blockquote>
sh# /usr/sbin/sshd -p 2000 &amp;
</blockquote>

<p>
You may then choose to log in to this server and continue the rest of
these steps from that shell.  We recommend doing this since some sshd
shutdown scripts do particularly nasty things like killing <b>all</b>
of the running SSH servers on a system, not just the parent server
that may be listening on port 22.
</p>

<p>
Roughly translated, this step is about guaranteeing that an alternate
method of access is available should the main SSH server be shutdown
and your connection via that server be terminated.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Locate your server's startup/shutdown script directory.  On some
systems this directory may be located at /etc/rc.d/init.d, but since
this location is not constant across operating systems, for the
purposes of this document we will refer to this directory as INITDIR.
Consult your operating system's documentation for your system's
location.
</li>

<li>
Run the following command

<blockquote>
sh# mv $INITDIR/sshd $INITDIR/sshd.bak
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
Either copy or link the new sshd script to your system's
startup/shutdown script directory.

<blockquote>
sh# cp $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd $INITDIR/sshd
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
Shutdown the currently running main SSH server.

<blockquote>
sh# $INITDIR/sshd.bak stop
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
Provided you still have a connection to the machine, start the new SSH
server.

<blockquote>
sh# $INITDIR/sshd start
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
Test the new server by connecting to the standard SSH port (22) and
authenticating via multiple methods.  Especially test that GSI
authentication works correctly.
</li>

<li>
If you are performing a new install, or if the old server was not
configured to be started at run-time and shutdown automatically at
system halt or reboot, either use a system utility such as RedHat's
chkconfig to configure the system for the correct run-levels, or
manually link up the correct run-levels.

<blockquote>
sh# /sbin/chkconfig sshd reset
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The recommended run-levels are listed in a set of comments within the
SXXsshd startup script.  For example, on standard Unix systems we
recommend running the GSI-Enabled OpenSSH server in run-levels two,
three, four, and five.
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
Finally, if, as a precautionary measure, you started a SSH server on
an alternate port in order to complete the install process, you can
now safely stop all instances of that server.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>

<li>
Edit the file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd so that the GSI-Enabled
OpenSSH server starts up on an alternate port.
</li>

<li>
Run the command
<blockquote>
sh# $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd start
</blockquote>
and verify that the server is running by checking that it both shows
up in a process listing and creates a file named
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/sshd.pid.
</li>

<li>
From a remote machine attempt to connect to the local server on the
modified test port using the standard SSH authentication methods plus
authenticating via your GSI credentials.
This may require you to authorize these users via an appropriate entry
in the grid-mapfile.
</li>

<li>
Stop the SSH server by running the command
<blockquote>
sh# $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd stop
</blockquote>
and reverse any changes you made that altered the port on which the server resided upon startup.  After this step,
running SXXsshd start should start the server on the default port (22).
</li>
