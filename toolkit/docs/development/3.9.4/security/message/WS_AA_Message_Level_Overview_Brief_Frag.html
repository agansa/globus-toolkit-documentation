The Web Services portions of GT 4.0 use SOAP as their message protocol
for communication. WS Authentication and Authorization Message-Level Security
  implements the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation specification
  to provide message protection for SOAP messages. Protection options include
  authentication of the sender, encryption of the message, integrity protection
  of the message and replay protection.
