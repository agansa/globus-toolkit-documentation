<h2><a name="whatistesting" id="whatistesting"></a>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </h2>
<p>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </p>
<h2><a name="participating" id="participating"></a>Participating in the GridFTP
  Testing Call is easy! </h2>
<ol>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending mail to <a href="mailto:testing@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> to
    let us know that you're helping out and describing what you intend to test.</li>
  <li>Install the software in a non-production environment. Use the 3.9.4 distribution
    from <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/</a>;
      the code can also be retrieved directly from CVS using the tag &quot;<code>globus_3_9_4</code>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Exercise the software.</li>
  <li>Log your experiences in <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/">http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/</a> under
      the &quot;GridFTP&quot; product. Please
      mention 3.9.4 explicitly in the body of the report.</li>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending descriptions of your tests to <a href="mailto:testing@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> so
    that we might use them to build standard tests in the future.</li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments about the process, send an
    email to <a href="mailto:testing@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a>. </li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments regarding this component, join the

<h2><a name="testingperiod" id="testingperiod"></a>Testing period </h2>
<p>The testing period for this call is December 17 - January 31 2005. </p>
<h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About GridFTP </h2>

<h2><a name="reasons"></a>Reasons for testing GridFTP </h2>

<p>This is a particularly critical testing period for GridFTP.  We have completley re-implemented the server and added striping functionality.  One of the keys to the success of GridFTP has been its stability and we need to insure that this new implementation is rock solid and completely protocol compliant.</p>
