<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>The RLS provides a Client API for C and Java based clients. The RLS Client C API is provided in the form of a library (e.g., .so file). Any installation of RLS will include the shared library as part of the <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/include</code> and <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib</code> directories. The RLS Client Java API depends on the shared library, which it links to via the Java Native Interface (JNI).</p>
