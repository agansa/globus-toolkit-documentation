<p>
   The Trigger Service collects data from resources on the grid and,
   if administrator defined rules match, can perform various actions. An
   example use is to send email when queue length on a compute resource goes
   over a threshold value.
</p>

<p>Grid resources, with matching rules, are registered to a trigger service.
   When a rule matches, an action script is run. This action script can
   perform a desired action, for example sending email or sending a 
   pager message.</p>

<h2><a name="configuring" id="configuring"></a>Configuring </h2>

<p>Information on configuration settings and environment variables can be found
   in the <a href="../WS_MDS_Trigger_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
   guide</a>.</p>

<p>The trigger service is an MDS aggregator service, and so inherits much
   of its configuration system from the aggregator module. The 
   <a href="../../aggregator/admin/index.html#configuring">configuration 
   instructions for the aggregator</a> should be read before this section.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the source parameters specified in the aggregator configuration
guide, there is a trigger specific configuration element that must
be added to all registrations made to the trigger service. This 
registration parameter, of type <code>TriggerRuleType</code> contains
the following options:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>matchingRule</code>: XPath rule to be applied against incoming data.
    The XPath expression will be evaluated against aggregated data, and 
     will be regarded as matching the incoming data if it matches 
     one or more nodes in that data.
 </li>

 <li><code>actionScript</code>: the name of a script in 
     <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/trigger/</code> that will be executed
     when the matchingRule matches (except as rate limited by the 
     following parameters).  </li>

 <li><code>minimumFiringInterval</code>: the action script will not be
     executed more than once in this number of seconds. If unspecified,
     there will be no minimum interval.  </li>

 <li><code>minimumMatchTime</code>:  the matchingRule must be true for
     this number of seconds before the actionScript will be executed.
     If unspecified, there is no minimum time period that the 
     rule must match and the rule will fire immediately the matchingRule
     becomes true.  </li>

 <li><code>outputXSL</code>: (UNIMPLEMENTED in GT 3.9.3). The delivered
     message will be transformed by the specified XSLT stylesheet
     and fed into the stdin of the action script. It is intended that
     this will be implemented in a subsequent release of the GT3.9.x series.
 </li>

</ul>
<p>The rate limiting parameters behave in such a way that the 
rate of action script executions can be <em>decreased</em> by
<em>increasing</em> the minimumFiringInterval and/or by 
<em>increasing</em> the minimumMatchTime.
