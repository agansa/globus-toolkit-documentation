<p>There is no GUI specifically for the aggregator. The release contains
   a tech preview of <a href="../../techpreview/webmds/index.html">WebMDS</a>
   which can be used to display monitoring information in a web browser. 
   Specifically, it can be directed at services based on the aggregator
   to display information about resources registered to the 
   aggregator.
