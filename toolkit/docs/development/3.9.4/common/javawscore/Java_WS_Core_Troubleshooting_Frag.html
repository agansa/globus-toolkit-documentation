<h3>General troubleshooting information</h3>
<p>
In general, if you want to investigate a problem on your own please see the <a href="../developer/index.html#debugging">Debugging and Logging</a> section for details on how to turn on debugging. Also, please note that most of the command line clients have <code>-debug</code> option that will display more detailed error messages including the error stack traces. Also, <a href="http://www-fp.globus.org/about/email-archive-search.html">searching the mailing lists</a> such as <a href="mailto:discuss@globus.org">discuss@globus.org</a> or <a href="mailto:developer-discuss@globus.org">developer-discuss@globus.org</a> (before posting a message) can also be very fruitful. Finally, if you think you have found a bug please report it in our <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a> system. Please include as much as detail about the problem as possible.
