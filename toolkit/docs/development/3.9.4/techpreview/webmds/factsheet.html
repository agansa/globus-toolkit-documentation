<h1>WebMDS factsheet for GT 4.0 tech preview</h1>

<h2>Brief Component Overview</h2>

WebMDS allows monitoring information to be presented to end users
through a standard web browser interface. This means that end users
do not need to install any software on their PC.

WebMDS is a redesign and reimplementation of a student project, 
WebSDB, which was released through the GTR and gave a similar interface
for GT3 MDS service data.

<h2>Summary of features</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Collects monitoring information from pluggable sources:
    <ul>
        <li>By default, by using WSRF Resource Properties poll operations.</li>
        <li>MDS archiver plug in development to display historical 
            information<li>
    </ul>
 </li>

 <li>Formatting of monitoring data (in XML) into HTML output is performed
     using pluggable XSLT style sheets. The 4.0 release contains
      a small number of
     unattractive stylesheets as examples, with it intended
     that subsequent releases will contain substantially improved
     (more useful and more visually appealing) stylesheets.
 </li>

</ul>
