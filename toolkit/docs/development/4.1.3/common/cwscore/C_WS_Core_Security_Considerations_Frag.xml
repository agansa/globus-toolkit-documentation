C WS-Core supports secure transport (https) and secure message
 (just X509 signing, not encryption).  
</para>
<section><title>Secure Transport</title>
<para>
With secure transport, 
the entire container must be run over an
https transport.  This is done by default for the C container.  If
the user does not want security in the container, 
or wants to use secure message instead
of secure transport, they should use the 
<computeroutput>-nosec</computeroutput> argument to 
<computeroutput>globus-wsc-container</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>
For clients, the secure transport is enabled if the contact
URI contains the 'https' scheme instead of 'http', so the 
client doesn't have to enable or disable it explicitly.

<section><title>Secure Message</title>
<para>
Secure message can be enabled for individual services, by
loading the ws security handler in the service's init function.
Alternatively, secure message can be enabled for all the services
in a container, by setting the secure message attribute on the
service engine's handle.
