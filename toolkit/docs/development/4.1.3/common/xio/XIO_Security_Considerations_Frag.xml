<para>Globus XIO is a framework for creating network protocols.  Several
      existing protocols such as TCP come built into the framework.  XIO
      itself introduces no known security risks, however all network
      applications allow the risks inherient when outsides can connect
      to a system.  Also included in the xio distribution is the gsi
      drive which provides a driver that allows for secure connections.
