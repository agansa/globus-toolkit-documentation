<title>Call for Community Testing: &shortversion; Java WS Core</title>
	
<section id="javawscore-cft-whatistesting"><title>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </title>
<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, we hope to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </para>

  We need volunteers to exercise Java WS Core to discover performance and scalability problems. Since Java WS Core is a critical piece to any service built on top of it, its performance and scalability directly affects the service. Therefore, improving the Java WS Core performance most likely will improve the service performance.

  We need volunteers for Java WS Core to discover functionality and usability problems. Improving usability and functionality will make the software easier to use and develop.
