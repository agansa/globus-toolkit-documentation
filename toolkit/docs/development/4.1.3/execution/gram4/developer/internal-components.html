<a name="seg"></a><h2>Scheduler Event Generator</h2>
<p>The Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) is a program which uses
scheduler-specific monitoring modules to generate job state
change events. At the SEG level, the state change events correspond to
changes in any jobs which are managed by the scheduler, even if they do
not correspond to jobs initiated by the Managed Job Service. These state
change events are propagated to the Job State Monitor.</p>

<p>Depending on scheduler-specific requirements, the SEG may need to run with
privileges to enable it to obtain scheduler event
notifications. As such, one SEG runs per scheduler resource. For example,
on a host which provides access to both PBS and fork jobs, two SEGs, running
at (potentially) different privilege levels will be running.</p>

<p>When executed, the SEG is able to start issuing events from some
time in the past. The SEG will, in general, not require any persistent
state between invocations. One SEG instance exists for any particular
scheduled resource instance (one for all homogeneous PBS queues, one for
all fork jobs, etc).</p>

<p>The SEG is implemented in an executable called the
globus-scheduler-event-generator, located in the Globus Toolkit's libexec
directory. It is invoked with the following command line:</p>

<pre>
    globus-scheduler-event-generator -s <SCHEDULER NAME> [-t <TIMESTAMP>]
</pre>

<a name="forkstarter"></a><h2>Fork Starter</h2>
<p>
The fork job starter's purpose is to provide a way to manage fork jobs such
that job state changes will be delivered in a timely way to the WS-GRAM
service. The fork job starter will be the parent of any number of processes
which were started in response to MJS job requests. As the parent, it will
receive the SIGCHLD signal when its child processes terminate, and use these to
propagate job state changes to the WS-GRAM service.</p>

<p>Communication between the fork job starter and the process which invokes it
is done through the standard input and output of the process. It communicates
job state changes through a log file which the fork Scheduler Event Generator
module parses.</p>

<p>Currently each job will cause a new starter to be created. The starter will
remain until the job terminates.<p>

<h3>Execution</h3>

<p>The fork job starter takes one argument on its command-line, the path to the
log file to record job state changes.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, it communicates with its parent process through its
standard input and standard output. All communications are done using the Fork
Starter protocol described below.</p>

<p>When the either the standard input or standard output of the fork starter are
closed, then the fork starter will no longer create any new job processes. It
will continue to run until all processes it started have terminated.</p>

<h3>Log Format</h3>
<p>For simplicity, the fork job starter's log format is based on the SEG
protocol messages related to job state changes. Log messages are of the
format:</p>

<pre>
        001;TIMESTAMP;JOBID;STATE;EXIT_CODE
</pre>

<p>Message Type Specific Content:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><em>JOBID</em></dt>
    <dd>local scheduler-specific job id</dd>
    
    <dt><em>STATE</em></dt>
    <dd>new job state (integer as per the GRAM protocol constants)</dd>
    
    <dt><em>EXIT_CODE</em></dt>
    <dd>job exit code if STATE is done or failed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Fork Starter Protocol</h4>
<p>
Each protocol message is contained on a single line terminated with the
linefeed character. Messages are encoded in ASCII. Lines are separated into a
number of fields delimited by the semicolon character. Each field may contain
subfields separated by the comma character. The backslash character is used to
form two-character escape sequences to protect characters which would
otherwise be significant in this protocol:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>\\</dt>
    <dd>literal backslash</dd>

    <dt>\;</dt>
    <dd>literal semicolon</dd>

    <dt>\,</dt>
    <dd>literal comma</dd>

    <dt>\n</dt>
    <dd>literal linefeed</dd>

    <dt>\=</dt>
    <dd>literal equals</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each protocol message begins with a 3 digit code which indicates the type of
message it is. This is always the first field in a message.</p>

<dl>
<dt>100 Start Job Request [input to the fork starter]</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The 100 message format is:
<pre>
    100;Tag;Attribute-list
</pre>
</p>

<p><tt>Tag</tt> is an arbitrary string containing a tag which will be included
in the fork starter's response the to this message. This is in case an
implementation of the fork starter allows multiple parallel job starts to
happen at once.</p>

<p>
<tt>Attribute-list</tt> is a set of job attribute fields. These fields are a
subset of the RSL used to create jobs via the GRAM Managed Job Service. Each
attribute in the list consists of a string (the attribute name), the equals
character, and one or more attribute values separated by commas.</p>

<p>The fork starter understands the following attributes:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>directory</dt>
    <dd>Path string of the directory to execute the job in.</dd>
    <dt>environment</dt>
    <dd>Set of subfields containing the job environment. Each subfield consists
    of a VAR=VALUE pair.</dd>
    <dt>count</dt>
    <dd>Integer count of job instances to start.</dd>
    <dt>executable</dt>
    <dd>Path string of the executable to start. The executable's argv[0] will
    be set to this value.</dd>
    <dt>arguments</dt>
    <dd>Set of subfields containing the executable's arguments
    (argv[1]...argv[n]).</dd>
    <dt>stdin</dt>
    <dd>Path string to the standard input file.</dd>
    <dt>stdout</dt>
    <dd>Set of path strings to the standard output files for each process.</dd>
    <dt>stderr</dd>
    <dt>Set of path strings to the standard error files for each process.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
RSL attributes such as jobtype or library_path must be handled by the code
which invokes the fork starter (by updating the related job attributes---
for example, replacing the executable with mpirun and adding "-np count
executable-path" to the argument list).</p>

<p>All files (executable, stdin, etc) must be resolved to local paths before
being passed to the fork starter (staging or cache lookups must be completed
before invoking the fork starter).</p>

</dd>

<dt>101 Successful Job Start [output from the fork starter]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The 101 Message format is:</p>

<pre>
    101;tag;pid[,pid]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>tag</tt> field contains the same tag string as was passed to the
Fork Job Starter in a Job Start (100) message.</p>

<p>The <tt>pid</tt> field contains a list of subfields which correspond to the
processes forked by the starter.
</dd>

<dt>102 Unsuccessful start [output from the fork starter]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The 102 Message format is:</p>

<pre>
    102;tag;error-code;error-message
</pre>

<p>The <tt>tag</tt> field contains the same tag string as was passed to the
Fork Job Starter in a Job Start (100) message.</p>

<p>The <tt>error-code</tt> contains the GT2 GRAM integer error code indicating
why the job start failed.</p>

<p>The <tt>error-message</tt> contains an error string which may be useful in
diagnosing the problem with starting the job.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Development Plan</h3>
<p>Initially for GT 4.0 The Globus::Gram::JobManager::fork module will be
modified to use this in place of native perl fork and exec calls. This implies
that one forker starter will be present on the system for each job started
(until the job terminates). When a java interface for starting jobs is written,
then the job starter will be started once per user (via sudo) per hosting
environment instance.</p>
