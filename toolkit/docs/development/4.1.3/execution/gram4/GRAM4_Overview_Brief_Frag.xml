  Web Services Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM4) component
  comprises a set of WSRF-compliant Web services to locate, submit, monitor,
  and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. GRAM4 is not a <glossterm>job scheduler</glossterm>,
  but rather a set of services and clients for communicating with a range of
  different batch/cluster job schedulers using a common protocol. GRAM4 is
  meant to address a range of jobs where reliable operation, stateful
  monitoring, credential management, and file staging are important.
