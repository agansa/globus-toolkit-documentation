The following usage statistics are sent by default in a UDP packet at the end of
each job (i.e. when Done or Failed state is entered).
<ul>
    <li>job creation timestamp</li>
    <li>scheduler type (Fork, PBS, LSF, Condor, etc...)</li>
    <li>jobCredentialEndpoint present in RSL flag
        (to determine if server-side user proxies are being used)</li>
    <li>fileStageIn present in RSL flag</li>
    <li>fileStageOut present in RSL flag</li>
    <li>fileCleanUp present in RSL flag</li>
    <li>CleanUp-Hold requested flag
        (to determine if streaming is being used)</li>
    <li>job type (Single, Multiple, MPI, or Condor)</li>
    <li>gt2 error code if job failed</li>
    <li>fault class name if job failed
        (to determine general classes of common faults users experience)</li>
</ul>

We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve
the GRAM component.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable this feature, please
see the core admin guide section on <u>Usage Statistics</u> for instructions.
There is also a <u>standard disclaimer</u> that is recommended reading.
