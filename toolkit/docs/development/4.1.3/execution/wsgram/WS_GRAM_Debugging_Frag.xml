<para>
For starters, consult the
<ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/common/javawscore/developer-index.html#debugging">Debugging section of
the Java WS Core Developer's Guide</ulink> for details about what files to edit and
other general log4j configuration information.
</para>
<para>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Executable Job Service (MEJS), add the
following entry to the <computeroutput>container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file:
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.exec=DEBUG
</screen>
To turn on debug logging for the delegated proxy management code, add the
following entry to the <computeroutput>container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file:
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.utils=DEBUG
</screen>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Multi Job Service (MMJS), add the
following entry to the <computeroutput>container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file:
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.multi=DEBUG
</screen>
To turn on debug logging for the Managed Job Factory Service (MJFS), add the
following entry to the <computeroutput>container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file:
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec.service.factory=DEBUG
</screen>
To turn on debug logging for all GRAM code, add the following entry to the
<computeroutput>container-log4j.properties</computeroutput> file:
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.exec=DEBUG
</screen>
Follow the pattern to turn on logging for other specifc packages or classes.

<section><title>Debugging script execution</title>
<para>
It may be neccessary to debug the scheduler scripts if jobs aren't being
submitted correctly, and either no fault or a less-than-helpful fault is
generated.  Ideally we would like that this not be neccessary; so if you find
that you must resort to this, please file a bug report or let us know on the
discuss e-mail list.
</para>
<para>
By turning on debug logging for the MEJS (see above), you should be able to
search for <emphasis>"Perl Job Description"</emphasis> in the logging output to find the perl
form of the job description that is sent to the scheduler scripts.
</para>
<para>
Also by turning on debug logging for the MEJS, you should be able to search for
<emphasis>"Executing command"</emphasis> in the logging output to find the specific commands
that are executed when the scheduler scripts are invoked from the service code.
</para>
<para>
Beyond the above advice, you may want to edit the perl scripts themselves to
print more detailed information like the native scheduler <glossterm>job description</glossterm>. For
more information on the location and composition of the scheduler scripts,
please consult the <ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/execution/wsgram/developer/scheduler-tutorial-perl.html">WS-GRAM
Scheduler Interface Tutorial</ulink>.
