<h1>Globus Toolkit 4.0: WS_GRAM Key Concepts</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>

WS_GRAM provides a set of web services to submit, monitor, and cancel
jobs on Grid computing resources.  Jobs are computational tasks that
may perform input/output operations while running which affect the
state of the computational resource and its associated filesystems.
In practice, such jobs may require coordinated staging of data into
the resource prior to job execution and out of the resource following
execution.  Monitoring consists of querying and subscribing for status
information such as job state changes.

</p>

<p>

Grid computing resources are typically operated under the control of a
scheduler which implements allocation and prioritization policies
while optimizing the execution of all submitted jobs for efficiency
and performance.  WS_GRAM is not a resource scheduler, but rather a
protocol engine for communicating with a range of different local
resource schedulers using a standard message format.

</p>

<h2>Conceptual Details</h2>

<p>

A number of concepts underly the purpose and motivation for
WS_GRAM. These concepts are divided into broad categories below.

</p>

<h3>Component architecture</h3>

<p>

Rather than consisting of a monolithic solution, WS_GRAM is based on a
component architecture at both the protocol and software
implementation levels. This component approach serves as an ideal
which shapes the implementation as well as the abstract design and
features.

</p>

<dl>

<dt>WS_GRAM service suite</dt>

<dd><p>Job management with WS_GRAM makes use of multiple types of
service: <ul>

<li><p>Job management services represent, monitor, and control the
overall job lifecycle. These services are the job-management specific
software provided by the WS_GRAM solution.</p></li>

<li><p>File transfer services support staging of files into and out of
compute resources. WS_GRAM makes use of these existing services rather
than providing redundant solutions.</p></li>

<li><p>Credential management services are used to explicitly control the
delegation of rights among distributed elements of the WS_GRAM
architecture based on users' application requirements. Again, WS_GRAM
makes use of more general infrastructure rather than providing a
redundant solution.</p></li>

</ul>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>WSRF service model</dt>

<dd><p>The Globus Toolkit software development environment, and
particularly WSRF core, is used to implement distributed
communications and service state.</p></dd>

<dt>Scheduler adapters</dt>

<dd><p>A scripted plug-in architecture is provided by WS_GRAM to enable
extension with adapters to control a variety of local schedulers.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Security</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Secure operation</dt>

<dd>WS_GRAM utilizes WSRF functionality to provide for authentication
of job management requests as well as to protect job requests from
malicious interference.  The use of WS_GRAM does not reduce the
ability for system administrators to control access to their computing
resources.  The use of WS_GRAM also does not reduce the safety of jobs
users run on a given computing resource. </dd>

<dt>Local system protection domains</dt>

<dd>To protect users from each other, jobs are executed in appropriate
local security contexts, e.g. under specific Unix user IDs based on
details of the job request and authorization policies.  Additionally,
WS_GRAM mechanisms used to interact with the local resource are design
to minimize the priveleges required and to minimize the risks of
service malfunction or compromise.</dd>

<dt>Credential delegation and management</dt>

<dd>A client may delegate some of its rights to WS_GRAM services in
order to facilitate the above functions, e.g. rights for WS_GRAM to
access data on a remote storage element as part of the job
execution. Additionally, the client may delegate rights for use by the
job process itself.</dd>

<dt>Audit</dt>

<dd>To assist with normal accounting functions as well as to further
mitigate risks from abuse or malfunction, WS_GRAM uses a range of
audit and logging techniques to record a history of job submissions
and critical system operations.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Job Management</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Reliable job submission</dt>

<dd>WS_GRAM provides an ``at most once'' job submission semantics.
A client is able to check for and possibly resubmit jobs, in order
to account for transient communication errors without risk of
running more than one copy of the job.</dd>

<dt>Job cancellation</dt>

<dd>While many jobs are allowed to run to their natural completion,
WS_GRAM provides a mechanism for clients to cancel (abort) their jobs
at any point in the job lifecycle.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Data management</h3>

<dl>


<dt>Reliable data staging</dt>

<dd>WS_GRAM provides for reliable, high-performance transfers of files
between the compute resource and external (gridftp) data storage
elements before and after the job execution.</dd>

<dt>Output monitoring</dt> 

<dd>WS_GRAM provides a mechanism for incrementally transferring output
file contents from the computation resource while the job is
running.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Task coordination</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Parallel jobs</dt>

<dd>Some jobs are parallel, meaning that they consist of more than one
simultaneous tasks. These tasks are often hosted on parallel computing
hardware to provide increased computational throughput.</dd>

<dt>Startup barrier</dt>

<dd>Many parallel jobs require a guarantee that the correct number of
tasks have been started.  WS_GRAM does not enforce such constraints,
but relies on the local scheduler to provide the appropriate job
startup semantics.</dd>

<dt>Task rendezvous</dt>

<dd>Some parallel programming environments, such as MPI, provide
mechanisms for all tasks in a parallel computation to find out about
each other: to know the number of peer tasks as well as possibly to
exchange some information between tasks.  WS_GRAM provides a mechanism
for task rendezvous which job applications may use if they do not have
another more appropriate solution. WS_GRAM does not require tasks to
be coordinated, but addresses this requirement in order to facilitate
a wider range of applications.</dd>
