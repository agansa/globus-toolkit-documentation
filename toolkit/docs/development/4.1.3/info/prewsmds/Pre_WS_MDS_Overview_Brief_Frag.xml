<para>Pre-WS MDS  provides a standard
  mechanism for publishing and discovering resource status and configuration
  information. It provides a uniform, flexible interface to data collected by
    lower-level <glossterm linkend="information-provider">information providers</glossterm>. It has a decentralized structure that allows
  it to scale, and it can handle static or dynamic data. A project can also restrict
  access to data by combining GSI (Grid Security Infrastructure) credentials
  and authorization features provided by MDS. Pre-WS MDS is essentially MDS 2.4
  that came out with Globus Toolkit 2.4 and is based on LDAP and GRIS/GIIS protocols.</para>
