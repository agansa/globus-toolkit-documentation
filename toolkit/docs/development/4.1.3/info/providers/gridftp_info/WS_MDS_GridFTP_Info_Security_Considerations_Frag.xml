    <!-- as of 8.28.2006, the above frag reads as follows: -->
    <para>By default, the <glossterm baseform="aggregator source">aggregator sources</glossterm> do not use authentication
    credentials -- they retrieve information using anonymous SSL
    authentication or no authentication at all, and thus retrieve only
    publicly-available information. If a user or administrator changes
    that configuration so that a service's aggregator source uses
    credentials to acquire non-privileged data, then that user or
    administrator must configure the service's aggregator sink to limit
    access to authorized users.</para>

<para>Additionally the user should consider that publishing system-specific
information as is the intention of this provider can have security 
ramifications.</para>

<!-- Below you can add any other security considerations that apply to your information provider. -->
