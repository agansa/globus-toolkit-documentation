<p>Although the basic functionality remains the same for MDS in GT4,
the architecture, standards used, and implementation have changed
significantly in GT2.  The following table shows a mapping of some
GT2 concepts to GT4 concepts.</p>

<td>Queryable index of aggregated information</td>
<td>GIIS, which publishes data using the LDAP-related standards listed
above</td>
<td>WS MDS Index Server, which publishes data using the WSRF-related
standards listed above</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queryable source of non-aggregated information</td>
<td>GRIS, which uses information providers to gather data from services
and then publishes that data the LDAP-related standards listed above</td>
<td>Individual web services, which publish data about their own resources
using WSRF-related standards listed above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Index registration mechanism</td>
<td>MDS servers (GRIS's and, in some cases, GIIS's) register themselves
with a GIIS.  An MDS server is configured to register itself to a remote
index by editing the local MDS server's
<code>grid-info-resource-register.conf</code> file, providing
information about the location of the remote index to register to
and timeout values for the registration</td>
<td>WS MDS Index servers maintain aggregating service groups that
include registration information (timeout values, the mechanism to
use to acquire information, and additional mechanism-specific parameters)
The registration is accomplished by
adding an entry to an aggregating service group via the 
<code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> command.</td>
</tr>
<td>Mechanism used by an index to collect information</td>
<td>GIIS's send LDAP queries to remote serves.</td>
<td>WS MDS Index servers use a plugin-based architecture
to support several mechanisms to collect information.
The Globus Toolkit supplies plugins that support collecting
information via polling (resource property queries),
subscription/notification, and by program execution.</td>
