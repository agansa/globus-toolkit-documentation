<h1>Deploying MDS4 in a Virtual Organization</h1>

<p>MDS should be deployed in a distributed fashion. Some components
should be deployed central to a VO, whilst others should be deployed
on individual resources. This document is a suggested deployment, and
is not the only way in which MDS4 components can be deployed.

</p>

<h2>What to deploy where</h2>

<h3>Central to the VO</h3>

<p>The following can be deployed central to your VO. They do not
need to be run on the same host or be at the same location.</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy an <b>index service</b> central to the VO to collect 
    information about
    all of the resources in the VO.</li>

<li>Configure an executing <b>index service</b> to execute scripts for 
    monitoring non-WSRF 
    services, and register it to the central index service. This can 
    be central to the VO.</li>

<li>If your VO is part of a larger VO, register the central index 
    service of your VO to the central index of the larger VO.</li>

</ul>


<p>On each GRAM resource:</p>

<ul>

<li>Configure <b>cluster monitoring</b> at each GRAM installation to publish 
    information about each resource. </li>

<li>Register each resource into the central index service. </li>

</ul>

<p>On each RFT resource:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register each RFT resource into the central index service.</li>
</ul>
