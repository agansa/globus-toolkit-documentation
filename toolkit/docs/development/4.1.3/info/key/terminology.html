<p>[summary of major changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>changed 'aggregation services' back to 'aggregator services' </li>
  <li>changed 'monitored entity' to 'Grid resource' </li>
  <li>took out definition of &quot;information&quot;</li>
  <li>introducing term &quot;information flow&quot; to describe the path of info from grid
    resources to aggregator service (which corresponds with ben's deployment
    overview graphic] </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>aggregator service</h2>
<p>A service that collects information using the WS-MDS aggregator framework,
  and then does something with it.  WS-MDS includes two aggregator services:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>MDS-Index, which publishes information as service groups</li>
  <li>MDS-Trigger,
          which runs an arbitrary executable program, passing the information
    as input to that program</li>
</ul>
<p>A third aggregator service is planned: an MDS-Archive,
          which will maintain an archive of historical information. </p>
<p>
[Maybe I should have called this an "aggregator service" -- Laura</p>
<p>yeah - i'd go with &quot;aggregator service&quot; because that's ian's term -  unless
  there's a strong reason for not using it -- Cris]. </p>
<h2>Grid resources </h2>
<p>That which is being monitored (for WSRF services, equivalent to WS-Resources).
  Essentially any entity in a virtual organization (VO) from which an aggregator
  service can obtain information: for example, a file, a program, a Web service,
  or another network-enabled service.</p>
<p>[I substituted Grid resources for 'monitored entities'. anybody say 'nay'?
  -- Cris] </p>
<h2>information sources</h2>
<p>Sources of information about a Grid resource you want to monitor. </p>
<p>[what else can we
    say about them? samples? -- Cris] </p>
<p> NOTE: something can be both a Grid resource *and* an information source
  if it collects information about itself (e.g., when a WSRF service provides
  information about its own resource properties)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>aggregator source</h2>
<p>An aggregator source collects  information about a Grid resource
  from an information source and passes it to an aggregator service (usually
  an MDS-Index service). More specifically, an aggregator source is a java class
  that implements the AggregatorSource interface (in the Aggregator framework)
  to take information about a Grid resource from an information source and pass
  it to an aggregator service in XML. The MDS-Index service calls the aggregator
  source to collect information. There are several kinds of aggregator sources. </p>
<p>
[Cris had a section here on types of aggregator sources, but I don't think it
really added much beyond the list of examples.  That is, I think saying "here
are some aggregator sources that we provide" is enough, and we don't need to
come up with a taxonomy of the different types of aggregator source.  -- Laura</p>
<p>cool --Cris ] </p>
Several aggregator sources are included as part of the GT distribution, including
<ul>
  <li>&lt;poll-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which polls WSRF services
    for resource properties</li>
  <li>&lt;subscribe-source-name&gt;, a WSRF aggregator source which receives
    resource properties from WSRF services through subscription/notification</li>
  <li>&lt;executable-source-name&gt;, a non-WSRF aggregator source which runs
    an executable to acquire (or generate) information in some XML form.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information flow between Grid resources and aggregator services </h2>
<p>In theory, an aggregator source could simply generate information on its own;
  in practice, however, aggregator sources generally communicate with information
  sources. In turn, information sources can publish information about themselves
  (which also makes it a monitoring entity) but many times publishes information
  about a separate Grid resource. </p>
<p>To put it all together, the <em>information flow</em> describes how information
  sources and aggregator sources carry information from a Grid resource to an
  aggregator service. First we'll describe the relationship between these entities
  and then show a diagram of the flow. </p>
<p>The following table uses three different examples to describe the relationships:</p>
<p>[need help filling in examples - or let me know if there's a better way to
  represent examples. -- Cris] </p>
