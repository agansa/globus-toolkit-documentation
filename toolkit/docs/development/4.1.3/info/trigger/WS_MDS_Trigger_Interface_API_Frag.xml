<section><title>Programming Model Overview</title>
<para>There are two
programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service:  information is collected
    using an <glossterm linkend="aggregator-source">Aggregator Source</glossterm> and acted upon by an executable program.</para>
<para>There is no "client" interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
will later be read by some other program).</para>
