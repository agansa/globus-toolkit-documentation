        <title>Trigger Service Resource Properties</title>
        <para>In addition to the resource properties for the Aggregator Framework, the Trigger
            Service exposes the following:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>TriggerName</constant> This resource property allows one to arbitrarily
                name the trigger. This is used to assist one in managing many triggers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>TriggerStatus</constant> This resource property is used to indicate the
                current status of the trigger. There are two states allowed:
                <constant>enabled</constant> and <constant>disabled</constant>.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>MemberEPR</constant> This resource property reveals the monitored service
                that the trigger is associated with</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>TriggerID</constant> This resource property is a unique ID assigned to the
                trigger. It is essentially the EPR's Resource Key.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>MatchingRule</constant> This resource property is the XPath expression
                that will be used in evaluating incoming aggregator data. The trigger will fire (if
                enabled) if the expression is "true" (in a boolean sense). But if "EnableBoolean" is
                set to "false", then if the MatchingRule returns any data, the trigger will fire.
                This is consistent with pre-4.2 trigger functionality.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>NamespaceMappings</constant> This resource property allows one to use
                namespaces in the MatchingRule.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>ActionScript</constant> This resource property is the name of the action
                script that should be fired when the trigger evaluation is "true". The action script
                is located in the <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/trigger/</computeroutput>
                directory.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>EnableBoolean</constant> This resource property is by default
                    <computeroutput>true</computeroutput>, meaning that it is set up to evaluate
                XPath queries as "true" or "false", firing only when "true". If this property is set
                to "false", then the trigger will fire only if the MatchingRule evaluation returns
                any data</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>EnableBoolean</constant> This resource property is by default
                    <computeroutput>true</computeroutput>, meaning that it is set up to evaluate
                XPath queries as "true" or "false", firing only when "true".</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>MinimumFiringInterval</constant>The action script will not be executed
                more than once in this number of seconds. If unspecified, there will be no minimum
                interval.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>
                <constant>MinimumMatchTime</constant>The MatchingRule must be true for this number
                of seconds before the ActionScript will be executed. If unspecified, there is no
                minimum time period that the rule must match and the rule will be eligible to fire
                immediately after the MatchingRule becomes true.</simpara>
        </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>StartTime</constant>The trigger will not fire, nor will the TriggerService
                 perform any evaluations before the StartTime, if indicated. If a start time is not
                 indicated, the TriggerService will begin immediately performing evaluations, if the
                 trigger is active (i.e. TriggerStatus is set to "enabled")</simpara>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>EndTime</constant>The TriggerService will not perform any evaluations
                 after the EndTime, if indicated. If an end time is not indicated, the TriggerService
                 will continue performing evaluations (of "active" triggers) until an EndTime is
                 specified, otherwise until the container is shutdown. After an EndTime has passed,
                 the TriggerService will basically be doing nothing, but you may whenever you wish
                 change the EndTime, and the trigger evaluations will then begin again until the
                 EndTime again is reached.</simpara>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>InvalidityStartTime</constant>The trigger will not fire, nor will the
                 TriggerService perform any evaluations after the InvalidityStartTime, if indicated.
                 If an InvalidityStartTime is indicated, an InvalidityEndTime must also be specified.
                 During this time period, the TriggerService will not perform any evaluations, if the
                 trigger is active (i.e. TriggerStatus is set to "enabled")</simpara>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>InvalidityEndTime</constant>This parameter requires an
                 InvalidityStartTime, and during the time period between the InvalidityStartTime and
                 InvalidityEndTime, the TriggerService will not perform any evaluations. If there is
                 an EndTime specified, then trigger evaluations will begin after the
                 InvalidityEndTime until the EndTime.</simpara>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>ActionScriptInputFullOriginal</constant>This parameter, if set to "true"
                 will pass the original trigger message input (to which the matching rule was
                 applied) to the action script. The default behavior is to always pass the entire
                 input message to the action scripts. For action scripts which do not need to consume
                 the unmodified input, this variable may be set to "false" in order to increase
                 performance. [For users familiar with previous versions of the Trigger Service, if
                 you set ActionScriptInputFullOriginal to "true", this is equivalent to setting
                 disableUnmodifiedActionScriptInput to "false", in other words it will pass the
                 original trigger message input (to which the matching rule was applied) to the
                 action script.]</simpara>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
             <simpara>
                 <constant>ActionScriptInputXPathQueryResult</constant>If this value is present and
                 set to true, the service will pass the filtered output result of the XPath
                 MatchingRule as additional input to the stdin of the action script, in addition to
                 the original input to which the matching rule was applied. The default behavior if
                 unspecified is true, meaning the Xpath query result will be passed as input to the
                 action script. [For users familiar with previous versions of the Trigger Service, if
                 you set ActionScriptInputXpathQueryResult to "true", this is equivalent to setting
                 enableFilteredActionScriptInput to "true".]</simpara>
