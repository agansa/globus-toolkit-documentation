<p>The Trigger Service itself does not have any command-line clients for end
users; instead,
the trigger service is configured to run an executable program to take some
action (for example, send mail to a set of users, or write a log entry to
a file).</p>
<p>The <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> command is used to configure the
Trigger Service to collect information from various sources; see the
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#cmd">Aggregator
Framework</a> documentation for more information. </p>
