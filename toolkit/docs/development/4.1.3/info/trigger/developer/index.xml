<section id="s-trigger-developer-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
The WS MDS Trigger Service collects information about Grid resources and can be configured to execute a program if the collected data meets certain conditions.
This document describes the programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service.

<section id="s-trigger-developer-archdes"><title>Architecture and design overview</title>
<para>The Trigger Service collects information and acts on it, by executing an
administrator-supplied executable program when certain conditions (expressed
as XPath matches on the collected information) are met.  There are two
programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service:  information is collected
using an Aggregator Source and acted upon by an executable program.</para>
<para>There is no "client" interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
will later be read by some other program).</para>
</section>

<section id="s-trigger-developer-pubinterfaces"><title>Public interface</title>
<para>The public interfaces for specifying trigger actions, including
specifications for executable programs to be executed by the trigger,
can be found in <xref linkend="c-trigger-Public_Interfaces"/>.</para>
<para>The public interfaces for creating and configuring aggregator sources --
sources of information used by the trigger service -- can be found in
the
<ulink url="../aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html">Aggregator
Framework Public Interface Guide</ulink>.</para>

<section id="s-trigger-developer-scenarios"><title>Usage scenarios</title>

<section><title>Controlling information collected by the Trigger Service</title>
<para>Information is collected by the Trigger Service by way of an <emphasis>aggregator source</emphasis>.  The
Globus Toolkit distribution includes several standard aggregator sources
(see <xref linkend="c-trigger-admin"/> for more details).
To create your own custom information source, see the
<ulink url="../aggregator/developer-index.html">WS MDS Aggregator Developer's Guide</ulink>.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Controlling the Conditions Under Which the Executable is Executed</title>
<para>
This is handled through configuation options (see
<xref linkend="s-trigger-admin-configuring"/> for details).
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Programming the Executable</title>
<para>
The executable program triggered by the Trigger Service can be written in any
programming or scripting language.  The specifications for this program are
documented in <xref linkend="s-trigger-Public_Interfaces-domain"/>.

<para>
See the <ulink url="../../common/javawscore/developer-index.html/#s-javawscore-developer-debugging">Debug section of the Java WS Core Developer's Guide</ulink>
for general information on logging, including which files to edit to set
logging properties.
</para>
<para>
To turn on debug logging for the Trigger Service, add the line:
</para>
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.mds.trigger=DEBUG
</screen>
<para>
to the appropriate properties file.  Since the Trigger Service is implemented
using the aggregator framework, you may also want to turn on aggregator
debugging by adding this line:
</para>
<screen>
log4j.category.org.globus.mds.aggregator=DEBUG
</screen>
