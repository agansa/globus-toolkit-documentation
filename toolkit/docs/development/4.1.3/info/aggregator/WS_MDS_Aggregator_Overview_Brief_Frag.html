<p>The Aggregator module consists of an Aggregating ServiceGroup framework which supports an extensible plugin architecture.</p>

<p>The Aggregating ServiceGroup framework is designed to facilitate the collecting
  of information from or about WS-Resources via plugin aggregator sources and
the feeding of that information to plugin aggregator  sinks.</p>

<p>Resources may be registered to an aggregating ServiceGroup using the ServiceGroup add operation. Each registration will be represented as a ServiceGroupEntry resource. When a registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks will be informed and aggregated data from the registered resource will begin to flow via the aggregation source into the aggregation sink.</p>

<p>The method of collection by source and processing by the sink is dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator framework.</p>
