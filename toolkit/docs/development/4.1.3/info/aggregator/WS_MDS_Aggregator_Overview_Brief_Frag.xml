    <para>The Aggregator Framework is the software framework on which WS MDS services (currently,
        the WS MDS <glossterm baseform="Index Service">Index</glossterm> and WS MDS <glossterm
            baseform="Trigger Service">Trigger</glossterm> services) are built. The Aggregator
        Framework collects data from an <glossterm>aggregator source</glossterm> and sends that data
        to an <emphasis>aggregator sink</emphasis> for processing. Aggregator sources distributed
        with the Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data, acquire data through
        subscription/notification, and execute programs to generate data. Aggregator sinks include
        modules that implement the WS MDS Index Service interface and the WS MDS Trigger Service
        interface [and the Archive Service].</para>
