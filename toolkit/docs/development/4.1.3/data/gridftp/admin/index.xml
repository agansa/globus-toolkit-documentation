<bookinfo><abstract>    <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
            working with GridFTP. It provides references to information on procedures
            typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
            deploying, and testing the installation. This guide should help you configure
            and run the GridFTP <glossterm>server</glossterm> in some standard configurations.</para>
<para>        <important>
            <simpara> This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, 
                overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the <olink targetdoc="gtadmin"/>.  
                Read through this guide before continuing!</simpara>

    <para>GridFTP is built and installed as part of
        a default GT &version; installation. For basic installation instructions, see <olink targetdoc="gtadmin" />.
        
        No extra installation steps are required for this component.</para>

<para>It is assumed that the toolkit installation was successful and that Globus
security is properly configured.  For more information, see the

<para>The server should generally be run as root in daemon mode, though it is 
  possible to run it as a user (see below). When run as root you will need to have a 
  host certificate.</para>
<para>Run the server: </para>

</section>
<section id="gridftp-admin-data_nodes"><title>Remote data-nodes and striped operation</title>
<para>The GridFTP server now supports separate front end (client control connection)
and back end (data node) processes. In addition, a single front end process may
connect to multiple back end data nodes. </para>
<para>When multiple back end data nodes are available, the server is said to be 
in a striped configuration, or simply, is a striped server.  In this mode 
transfers are divided over all available data nodes, thus allowing the 
combined bandwidth of all data nodes to be used.</para>
<para>Note: The connection between the front end and data nodes is referred to as 
the <emphasis>ipc channel</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The ability to use inetd or daemon execution modes applies to both 
front end servers and data nodes, and the same certificate and user requirements
apply.</para>

<para>To start the front end: 
<screen>globus-gridftp-server &lt;args&gt; -r &lt;host:port&gt;[,&lt;host:port&gt;,...]</screen>
To start the data-node:
<screen>globus-gridftp-server -p &lt;port&gt; -dn</screen>
The <computeroutput>-p &lt;port&gt;</computeroutput> option used on the data-node is the port 
  that will be used for ipc connections.  This is the port that you will register
  with the front end server.</para>
<para>  For example:
<screen>machineB&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 6000 -dn
machineC&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 7000 -dn
machineA&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 5000 -r machineB:6000,machineC:7000</screen>
The client would only connect to the front end at 
<computeroutput>machineA:5000</computeroutput>, for example, using globus-url-copy with the -stripe option:
<screen>globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file file:///destination
   <emphasis>or</emphasis>
globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file gsiftp://machineX/destination</screen>
Where machineX may be another striped server or a standard GridFTP server.</para>


</section>

<section id="gridftp-admin-seperated"><title>Separation of Processes</title>
<para>
As is illustrated above, the GridFTP server can be separated into front end
and data node processes.  This is the architecture used to achieve a striped
server, but it can also be exploited to achieve a higher level of security.
</para>
<para>
Running the server as root is often desirable because it allows the server to
fork and setuid on a child processes related to an authenticated user.  This
allows the server to leverage the operating systems file system permissions
and other security devices.  However, it is not at all desirable to have
a root running process listening on a port open to the world.  If an
attacker were to compromise the process they could obtain root level
access to the machine.
</para>
<para>
To overcome this security risk the gridftp server can be run in a
front end/back end manner.  The front end can be run as any user, say user globus,
that has very limited access to the machine.  The front end is the processes
open to the outside world.  If it is compromised an attacker has only 
gained access to that limited account.  The back end is run as root, but
configured to only allow connections from the front end.
</para>
<para>To start the front end:</para> 
<screen>globus-gridftp-server -p 7000 -r localhost:7001</screen>
<para> and the back end:</para>
<screen>globus-gridftp-server -p 7001 -dn -allow-from 127.0.0.1</screen>

test suite may be run to verify functionality on your platform.  Simply set
up the globus environment, chdir to
