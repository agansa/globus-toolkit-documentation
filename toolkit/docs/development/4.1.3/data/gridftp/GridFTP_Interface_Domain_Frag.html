<h3>Interface introduction</h3>
<p><font color="purple">The Globus implementation of the GridFTP server draws on 3 IETF RFCs: RFC 959, RFC 2228, RFC 2389, an IETF Draft: MLST-16, and the GridFTP protocol specification which is a Global Grid Forum (GGF) Standard: GFD.020</font></p>
<h3>Syntax of the interface</h3>
<p><font color="purple">The command line tools and the client library completely hide the details of the protcol from the user and developer.  Unless you choose to use the control library, it is not necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the protocol.</font></p>
