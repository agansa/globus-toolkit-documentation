<para>RFT Service implementation
  in GT 4.0 uses
  standard SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd
  party GridFTP transfers and to delete files using GridFTP. The user
  creates a RFT resource by submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files
  that need to be transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The
  user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user is
  creating to a GT 4.0 container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
  The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and
  authenticated. RFT service implementation exposes operations to control
  and manage the transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both
  RFT factory and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource
  the user created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource
  property to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for
  the changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.</para>

<para> A standard way to debug RFT is to make container print out more verbose 
error messages. You can do that by doing the following steps: </para>
<para>
Edit $GLOBUS_LOCATION/container-log4j.properties 
and add following line to it: 
<computeroutput> log4j.category.org.globus.transfer=DEBUG </computeroutput>. For more verbosity add
<computeroutput> log4j.category.org.globus.ftp=DEBUG </computeroutput> which will print out Gridftp
messages too.
