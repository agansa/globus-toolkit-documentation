<section><title>Permissions of service configuration files</title>
<para>

The service configuration files such as <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> 
(located under <computeroutput>etc/&lt;gar&gt;/</computeroutput> directory) contain private information such as database passwords and usernames. Ensure that these configuration files are only readable by the user that is running the container. </para>
<para>  The deployment process automatically sets the permissions of <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>server-config.wsdd</computeroutput> as user readable only. However, this might not work correctly on all platforms and this does not apply to any other configuration files. </para>

<section><title>Access of information stored in the database</title>
<para>
RFT stores the transfer requests in a database. Proper security measures need to be taken to protect the access of the data by granting/revoking appropriate 
permissions on tables that are created for RFT use and other steps that are 
appropriate and consistent with site specific security measures.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Permissions of persistent data</title>
<para>
RFT uses the subscription persistence API from the GT4 core to store all of its subscription data under the <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted</computeroutput> directory. Ensure that the entire <computeroutput>~/.globus/persisted</computeroutput> directory is only readable by the user running the container.
