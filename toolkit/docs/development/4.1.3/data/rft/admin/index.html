<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
RFT Service implementation
in 3.9.3 uses
standard SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd
party GridFTP transfers and to delete files using GridFTP. The user
creates a RFT resource by submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files
that need to be transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The
user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user is
creating to a GT4 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and
authenticated. RFT service implementation exposes operations to control
and manage the transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both
RFT factory and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource
the user created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource
property to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for
the changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.<br>

If you want to deploy latest code from CVS do this: <br>
<br>
<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>
You need to checkout the tests from CVS as rft tests are not included
in the installer. Please follow the following steps to run RFT unit
tests.<br>
<ul>
  <li>cvs co ws-transfer/reliable/service/test</li>
  <li>Start a gridftp server on the machine you are running the tests
on port 5678. This can be done by running: globus-gridftp-server -s -p
5678 &amp;</li>
  <li>Start the container with RFT deployed in it.<br>
  </li>
  <li>cd ws-transfer/reliable/service/test</li>
  <li>ant test. This is will generate a report of the tests ran in the
current working directory.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
