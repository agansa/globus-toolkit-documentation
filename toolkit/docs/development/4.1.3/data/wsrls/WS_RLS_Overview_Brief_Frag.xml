<para>The WS Replica Location Service (WS RLS) provides a Web services interface for the existing Replica location Service (RLS). The features of the RLS have been preserved and interfaces should look familiar to users accustomed to working with the RLS. In many cases operations have been translated from the traditional C and Java form of the RLS to the WSDL form of the WS RLS in a nearly 1-to-1 manner. In some cases effort has been taken to adapt the interfaces to conform to expected style and conventions more typical of Web services. The interfaces consist of the WS-ReplicaLocationCatalog and the WS-ReplicaLocationIndex, representing the RLS Local Replica Catalog (LRC) and RLS Replica Location Index.</para>
