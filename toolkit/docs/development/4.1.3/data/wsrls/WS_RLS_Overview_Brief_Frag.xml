<para>The WS Replica Location Service (WS RLS) provides a Web services interface for the existing Replica Location Service (RLS). The features of the RLS have been preserved and interfaces should look familiar to users accustomed to working with the RLS. In most cases the interfaces are semantically similar (or identical) to the RLS operations, but effort has been made to adapt the interfaces to conform to expected style and conventions more typical of Web services. The interfaces consist of the WS-ReplicaLocationCatalog and the WS-ReplicaLocationIndex, representing the RLS Local Replica Catalog (LRC) and RLS Replica Location Index.</para>
