    <listitem><simpara>Initial implementation of the WS RLS, which provides a Web services interface to the existing RLS.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>WS-ReplicaLocationCatalog: WSDL-defined interface for performing LRC operations, including creating/adding/deleting mappings, defining/undefining attribute definitions, and creating/modifying/removing attributes. The interface also defines a conceptual set of WS-ResourceProperties based upon which queries may be performed.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>A simple query dialect which may be used to form expressions to be used to query the WS-RLS based on logical/target names and attributes.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>WS-ReplicaLocationIndex: WSDL-defined interface for performing RLI operations. Since the RLI is used as a read-only query interface (querying the index of logical name entries), the WSDL defines domain specific operations. The operation of interest is the standard QueryResourceProperties.</simpara></listitem>
