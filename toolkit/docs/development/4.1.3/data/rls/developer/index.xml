<section id="s-rls-developer-archdes"><title>Architecture and design overview</title>
<para>The Replica Location Service design consists of two components. Local Replica 
Catalogs (LRCs) maintain consistent information about logical-to-physical 
mappings on a site or storage system. The Replica Location Indexes (RLIs) 
aggregate state information contained in one or more LRCs and build a global, 
hierarchical distributed index to support discovery of replicas at multiple 
sites. LRCs send summaries of their state to RLIs using soft state update 
protocols. The server consists of a multi-threaded front end server and a 
back-end relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The front end server 
can be configured to act as an LRC server and/or an RLI server. Clients access 
the server via a simple string-based RPC protocol. The client APIs support C, 
Java and Python. The APIs contain operations to create and delete mappings, 
associate attributes with mappings, and perform queries.</para>
