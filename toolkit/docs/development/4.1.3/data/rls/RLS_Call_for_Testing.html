<h2><a name="whatistesting" id="whatistesting"></a>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </h2>
<p>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </p>
<h2><a name="participating" id="participating"></a>Participating in the RLS
  Testing Call is easy! </h2>
<ol>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending mail to <a href="mailto:testing@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> to
    let us know that you're helping out and describing what you intend to test.</li>
  <li>Install the software in a non-production environment. Use the 3.9.5 distribution
    from <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/</a>;
      the code can also be retrieved directly from CVS using the tag <font color="purple">[tag]</font>.</li>
  <li>Exercise the software.</li>
  <li>Log your experiences in <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/">http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/</a> under
      the &quot;Replication Services&quot; product &quot;RLS&quot; component.
      Please mention 3.9.5 explicitly in the body of the report.</li>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending descriptions of your tests to <a href="mailto:esting@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> so
    that we might use them to build standard tests in the future.</li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments about the process, send <a href="mailto:childers@mcs.anl.gov"></a>an
    email to <a href="mailto:esting@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a>. </li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments regarding this component, join the
    gt4-friends list to participate in discussions with other testers. (To subscribe,
    send an email to <a href="mailto:majordomo@globus.org">majordomo@globus.org</a> containing
    the words "subscribe gt4-friends" in the message body.) </li>

<h2><a name="testingperiod" id="testingperiod"></a>Testing period </h2>
<p>The testing period for this call is December 17 - January 31 2005. </p>
<h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About RLS </h2>
<?php

<h2><a name="reasons"></a>Reasons for testing RLS </h2>
<p>RLS is available for a variety platforms (Linux, UNIX flavors). We can only maintain a small number of possible platforms and most of our work takes place on RedHat Linux 7 and 9 and with MySQL server for database management. In addition, the distributed nature of RLS, and the wide array of use cases that can be satisfied with it, make it difficult to simulate the many production configurations that exist for the RLS.</p>

<h2><a name="envbuild"></a>Environment/build parameters and other special conditions to test</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Build, install, and test on RedHat (ES, AS), Fedora, and Debian flavors of Linux.</li>
  <li>Build, install, and test on FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX flavors of UNIX.</li>
  <li>Build and test Java clients using JDK 1.4 compliant JVM's from vendors other than Sun (e.g., IBM).</li>
  <li>Deploy with PostgreSQL and Oracle for database management.</li>
  <li>Test large-scale deployment with multiple sites for LRC and RLI services in fully connected and partially connected architectures.</li>
  <li>Test large-scale deployment by registering several million logical and physical file names at each LRC and propogate to connected RLIs.</li>
  <li>Test large-scale deployment using C Client API to execute 1000's of bulk operations per second.</li>
