     <bookinfo><abstract><para>This page contains information for commonly performed tasks using GT components. This assumes 
     a default installation and covers the more basic tasks using main tools. [FIXME]</para></abstract></bookinfo>
     
     <!-- need to point to these commonly looked for topics - or xinclude them into this guide:
     
     See the Quickstart for information on how to install and get started with the simplest of jobs.
     
     Basic info for all types of users (end-users, developers and sysadmins):(?)
     Basic security concepts to gain access to the grid via GT: 
          certificates (obtaining), 
          Generate a valid proxy (grid-proxy-init), 
          create a delegated credential (when?), 
          general GSI guidelines for grid users(?) -
     could be as simple as the steps outlined at globus-url-copy
     
     (should 'obtain certificate, generate valid proxy, and delegate credential' be in all 'using component' sections??)
     
     How to run, monitor and cancel (if necessary) the job you want to run in a Grid
          How do I run a job?
          How do I find the status of a job?
          How can I cancel a job?
     How to find, retrieve, move, store data
     
     and what you can do with the default index service+webmds
     
     Higher-level info
     mds
     
     Keep in mind that if you are using a GT-based application within a VO, you should look for documentation specific to your VO.
     
     orientation (separate doc?): need a table that shows default gt tools and describes 'useful if' so users understand which tools 
     have info they can use.
     
     *  Prerequisites for running Globus jobs (general security/cert/proxy requirements, grid-proxy-init)
