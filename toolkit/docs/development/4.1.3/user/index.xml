     <bookinfo><abstract><para>This page contains information for commonly performed tasks using GT components. This assumes 
     a default installation and covers the more basic tasks using main tools. [FIXME]</para></abstract></bookinfo>
     
     <!-- need to point to these commonly looked for topics - or xinclude them into this guide:
     
     See the Quickstart for information on how to install and get started with some basic jobs.
     
     Basic info for all types of users (end-users, developers and sysadmins):
     
     Basic security concepts to gain access to the grid via GT: 
          certificates (obtaining), 
          Generate a valid proxy (grid-proxy-init), 
          create a delegated credential (when?), 
          general GSI guidelines for grid users(?) -
     (could be as simple as the steps outlined at globus-url-copy)
     
     (should 'obtain certificate, generate valid proxy, and delegate credential' be in all 'using component' sections (as a frag)??)
     
     How to run, monitor and cancel (if necessary) the job you want to run in a Grid
          How do I run a job?
          How do I find the status of a job?
          How can I cancel a job?
     
     How to find, retrieve, move, store data
     
     How to monitor and discover resources on a Grid 
          default monitoring by index service of certain GT components
          how webmds makes it easy to see in browser
          describe hierarchy of index services
          trigger service
          info providers
     
     [Keep in mind that if you are using a GT-based application within a VO, you should look for documentation specific to your VO. - ??]
     
     orientation (separate doc?): need a table that shows default gt tools and describes 'useful if' so users understand which tools 
     have info they can use.
     
     *  Prerequisites for running Globus jobs (general security/cert/proxy requirements, grid-proxy-init)
     EXECUTION MANAGEMENT (Running Jobs On A Grid)
          Managing Jobs on a Grid -> GRAM
               * Basic commands

               * Submitting a parallel batch job locally using an RSL script
     
          -> GridWay
     
     lots use these subtopics: Job Failure, Check Job Status, Canceling a Job
     
     DATA MANAGEMENT (Manipulating Data On A Grid)
          
          FTP on a Grid -> GridFTP
               * Basic procedure for FTP'ing in a Grid (globus-url-copy from GridFTP)
               * Third party transfers (GridFTP)
               * Getting Files (GridFTP)
               * Putting Files (GridFTP)
               * Accessing data in...  (GridFTP)
                    ** non-POSIX data source
                    ** a non-POSIX file data source that has a POSIX interface
                    ** HPSS
                    ** SRB
               (admin howtos: Running in daemon mode, Running under inetd or xinetd - where is this in admin guide?)
          
          FTP Large datasets -> RFT 
               * Transferring large (10,000+ files) datasets (RFT)
               * Deleting a large (10,000+ files) set of files and directories (RFT)
     
          Manage large sets of replicated files -> RLS
               * Ping the server (RLS)
               * Creating replica location mappings (RLS)
               * Adding replica location mappings (RLS)
               * Querying replica location mappings (RLS)
               * Deleting replica location mappings (RLS)
               * Using bulk operations (RLS)
               * Using interactive mode (RLS)

          Use one service to manipulate large datasets and manage replicated files -> DRS
