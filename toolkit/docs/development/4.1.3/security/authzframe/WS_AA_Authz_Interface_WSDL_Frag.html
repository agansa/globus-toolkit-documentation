<p> The authorization framework as such does not have a WSDL
interface. As one of the authorization scheme in the toolkit, a
callout to a <b>LINK ME</b>OGSA-Authz compliant authorization service
is included. The callout makes a query on the configured authorization
service, which returns an authorization decision. </p>

<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p><font color="purple">[provide an overview of the protocol for the service]</font></p>

The <b>LINK ME</b>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used
for expressing the query and decision. A SAML Authorization Query,
with relevant information is constructed and sent on the wire to the
authorization service. The services processes the query and returns a
SAML Authorization Decision. If any fault occurs is embeded as a part
of the decision. The decision can be a permit, deny or indeterminate.

<h3>Operations</h3>
<p><font color="purple">[list and briefly describe each operation]</font></p>
<ul>

<li> SAMLRequest : Used to send in queries into the authorization
service and a decision is returned. All faults are embeded as a part
of the decision returned and no fault is thrown at WSDL level.

<li> GetResourceProperty : Gets the value of a specific resource property.
<li> SetResourceProperties : Sets the value for resource properties
<li> QueryResourceProperties : 
</ul>

<h3>Resource properties</h3>

<ul>

<li> supportedPolicies : Contains identifiers for any or all access
control policies that the authorization service is capable of rendering
decisions regarding

<li> supportsIndeterminate : Indicates whether the authorization service
returns decision of indeterminate. If not, only permit or deny is
