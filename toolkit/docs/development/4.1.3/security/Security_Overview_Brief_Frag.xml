<para>Security tools are concerned with establishing the identity of users or services
  (authentication), protecting communications, and determining who is allowed
  to perform what actions (authorization), as well as with supporting functions
  such as managing user credentials and maintaining group membership information.</para>
<para>GT4 provides distinct WS and pre-WS authentication and authorization capabilities.
  Both build on the same base, namely standard X.509 end entity certificates
  and proxy certificates, which are used to identify persistent entities such
  as users and servers and to support the temporary delegation of privileges
  to other entities, respectively.</para>

<para>GT4&rsquo;s WS security includes:</para>
<itemizedlist type="a">
  <listitem> <ulink url="message/">Message-level Security</ulink> mechanisms,
      which implement the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation
    specification to provide message protection for GT4&rsquo;s SOAP messages</listitem>
  <listitem><ulink url="message/">Transport-level Security</ulink> mechanisms, which uses transport-level security (TLS)
    mechanisms; and</listitem>
  <listitem>an <ulink url="authzframe/">Authorization Framework</ulink> that allows for a variety of authorization
      schemes, including a &ldquo;grid-mapfile&rdquo; access control list , an
      access control list defined by a service, a custom authorization handler,
    and access to an authorization service via the SAML protocol. </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For non-WS components, GT4
    provides similar authentication, delegation, and authorization mechanisms,
  although with fewer authorization options. See the following components for more information:</para>
