<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The main user issues for this component deal with configuring
credential related settings. There are multiple mechanisms for&nbsp;
doing
this:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Command line options (these are application specific)<br>
  </li>
  <li>CoG properties</li>
  <li>Environment variables</li>
  <li>Relying on default behavior. The only default behaviors available
concern the proxy file and trusted certificates locations.</li>
</ul>
More information on these mechanisms can be found in the <a
 href="../WS_AA_Message_Level_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
guide</a>.<br>

<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The main problems a user may encounter are
going to be related to credential acquisition and trusted certificate
authorities configuration:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credentials could not be acquired. This may happen for a variety
of reasons:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The configured location of the credentials is wrong</li>
    <li>The ownership of the credentials is wrong. They need to be
owned by the user trying to acquire them</li>
    <li>The permissions on the credentials are wrong. The private key
and implicitly the proxy file need to be readable only by the owner and
may not be a link.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The certificate the peer presented was not trusted. This may
happen for the following reasons:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The CA certificate that issued the peer's certificate is not
installed in the configured trusted, i.e. CA,&nbsp; certificates
location.</li>
    <li>The CA certificate that issued the peer's certificate is not
readable by the current user</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
