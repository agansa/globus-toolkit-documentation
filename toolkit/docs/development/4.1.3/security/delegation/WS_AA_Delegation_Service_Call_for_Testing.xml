<section id="delegation-ctf-whatistesting"><title>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </title>
<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </para>

<section id="delegation-ctf-reasons"><title>Reasons for testing Delegation Service </title>

<para> Delegation service is a new component added to the Globus Toolkit
in this release. The component was designed with the goal of being
able to remove the overhead of doing GSI Secure Conversation whenever
delegated credentials are required. Moreover, a credential can be
delegated once and shared across services co-hosted with the delegation
service, by merely using the endpoint reference to the delegated
credential.</para>

<para>This testing call is to seek feedback from users on whether the
component meets their needs, in terms of functionality and
performance. This also is a forum for tester to put forth suggestions
on additional feature/modifications to be able to achieve the above
goals.</para>
