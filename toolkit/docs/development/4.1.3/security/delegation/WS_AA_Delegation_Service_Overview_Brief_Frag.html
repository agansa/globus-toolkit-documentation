The Delegation Service is a new component in Globus Toolkit version
4.0. This component provides an exposed interface for delegation of
credentials to a host. This enables a single delegated credential to
be shared across multiple invocations of services on that host
(e.g. it could be used for multiple GRAM job submissions or across
GRAM and RFT submissions.) It also provides a means for credential
renewal.
