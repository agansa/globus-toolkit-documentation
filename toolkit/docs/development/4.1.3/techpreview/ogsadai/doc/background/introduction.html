<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<span class="important">OGSA-DAI</span> is a middleware product
that allows data resources, such as relational or
XML databases, to be accessed in Grids. Furthermore, it provides
some of the base capabilities that would be required to run higher-level 
data integration services in Grids.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
OGSA-DAI is motivated by the need to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provide an extensible framework to easily incorporate data resources
on to Grids.
</li>
<li>
Allow metadata about data and the data resources in which they are
stored to be obtained.
</li>
<li>

Provide a framework to facilitate the discovery of data that may be
distributed, or replicated, over many different types of data
resources, the locations of which may not be known beforehand.  </li>

<li>
Allow different types of data models, e.g. XML, relational or files,
from distributed data resources to be easily integrated to Grid
applications.

</li>
<li>
Allow services to be discovered that provide access to data resources holding 
required data.
</li>
<li>
Allow data to be accessed through uniform interfaces.
</li>
<li>
Facilitate the integration of data from various sources to obtain the required
information.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Does OGSA-DAI Provide?</h2>
<p>
OGSA-DAI provides an extensible framework that allows access to and
the updating of data resources. Intrinsic data resource capabilities may
be exploited and exposed to a Grid, such as performing SQL queries on
data stored in relational data resources or XPath statements on XML
data, as well as allowing additional data functionality, such as
asynchronous delivery or data transformation, to be provided at the
service layer.  Using the OGSA-DAI interfaces disparate, heterogeneous
data resources may be accessed in a uniform manner. It is important to
note though that the underlying data model is not hidden - a
relational data resource remains a relational resource and will not
masquerade as an XML data resource unless that mode of access is
already supported by that data resource nor does OGSA-DAI provide a
query language that is not already supported by the data resource or
through some other third party application.
</p>

<p>	
OGSA-DAI exposes data resources through services. Clients interact
indirectly with data resources via these services. OGSA-DAI provides
services compliant with three popular Web and Grid services
specifications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Services Inter-operability (WS-I)
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">http://www.ws-i.org/</a>
</li>
</ul>
The WS-I version of the OGSA-DAI distribution uses and is tested on 
a specific version of the UK OMII's web service infrastructure distribution. 
For more details see: <a href="http://www.omii.ac.uk">www.omii.ac.uk</a>.
</li>
<li>Web Services Resource Framework (WS-RF)
<ul>
<li>

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrf</a>
</li>
</ul>
The WS-RF version of the OGSA-DAI distribution uses and is tested on
a specific version of the Globus Toolkit's WS-RF implementation.
For more details see GT3.9.* or GT4.* at: 
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/">
www-unix.globus.org/toolkit</a>.
</li>
<li>Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI)
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsi-wg">
http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsi-wg</a>
</li>
</ul>
The OGSI version of the OGSA-DAI distribution uses and is tested on a
specific version of the Globus Toolkit's OGSI implementation. 
For more details see GT3.2.* or earlier versions at:
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/">
www-unix.globus.org/toolkit</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that you will have downloaded a specific distribution
of OGSA-DAI that conforms to only one of the above standards and 
uses a specific implementation of it. You must consult
the installation notes to find out the exact requirements. Also, these
different implementations of OGSA-DAI do not interoperate.
</p>
<p>
OGSA-DAI services can be used as the basic primitives for creating
sophisticated higher-level services that offer capabilities such as
data federation and distributed query processing. The OGSA-DAI middleware
layer can abstract away concerns such concerns as database driver
technology, data formatting techniques and delivery mechanisms, etc from
these higher-level services.
</p>
<p>
OGSA-DAI is intended to contribute to a future in which, it is
envisaged, scientists will move away from technical issues such as
handling data location, data structure, data transfer and
integration and instead focus on application-specific data analysis
and processing.
</p>

<h2>OGSA-DAI and DAIS</h2>
<p>
The <span class="important">DAIS</span> -
<span class="important">Database Access and Integration
Services</span> - Working Group of the <span class="important">Global
Grid Forum</span> (GGF) is formulating standards for database access
and integration services.
</p>
<p>
OGSA-DAI is involved in this activity and it is intended that OGSA-DAI
will eventually provide a reference implementations of these
standards. The GGF requires two independent and inter-operable
implementations of the standards for the standards to become GGF
recommendations.
</p>
<p>
Further information on the GGF and DAIS are available from:
</p>
<ul>
<li>DAIS Working Group:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/dais-wg/">

</li>
</ul>

<li>Global Grid Forum:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.gridforum.org/">http://www.gridforum.org/</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: the current distribution of OGSA-DAI is based
on a version of the DAIS specification released for GGF7 - it is
not an implementation of the current set of DAIS specifications.
