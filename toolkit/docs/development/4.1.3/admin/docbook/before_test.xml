	<para>
		Before you start installing the Globus Toolkit &shortversion;,
		there are a few things you should consider. The toolkit
		contains many subcomponents, and you may only be
		interested in some of them.
	</para>

	<para>
		There are non-web services implementations of:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Security (Pre-WS Authentication and Authorization)</listitem>
			<listitem>File Transfers GridFTP</listitem>
			<listitem>Resource Management (Pre-WS GRAM)</listitem>
			<listitem>Replica Location Service</listitem>
			<listitem>and Information Services (MDS2). </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	<important>
		<simpara>These all run on Unix platforms only.</simpara>
	</important>
	
	<para>Additionally, there are WSRF implementations of:</para>
	
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>Security (Delegation Service, ...?)</listitem>
				<listitem>Resource Management (WS GRAM)</listitem>
				<listitem>Reliable File Transfer (RFT)</listitem>
				<listitem>and Information Services (Index Service).</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
	
		<important>
			<simpara>All the Java clients to these services run on both Windows and Unix. The
				WSRF GRAM service requires infrastructure that only runs on Unix systems.</simpara>
		</important>

	<para>
		Therefore, if you are new to the toolkit and want to
		experiment with all of the components, you may want
		to use a Unix system. If you are interested in the
		Windows development, you may restrict yourself to the
		Java-based software.
