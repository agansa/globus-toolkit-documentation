<dd>   <B>MYPROXY_SERVER</B>
<dt>          Specifies  the  hostname where the <B>myproxy-server</B> is running.
              This environment variable can be used in place of the <B>-s</B> option.

<dd>   <B>MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT</B>
<dt>          Specifies the port where the <B>myproxy-server</B> is running.  This
              environment variable can be used in place of the <B>-p</B> option.

<dd>   <B>MYPROXY_SERVER_DN</B>
<dt>         Specifies the distinguished name (DN) of the  <B>myproxy-server</B>.
              All  MyProxy client programs authenticate the server's identity.
              By default, MyProxy servers run with host  credentials,  so  the
              MyProxy  client  programs  expect  the  server to have a distin-
              guished name  of  the  form  "host/&lt;fqhn&gt;"  or  "myproxy/&lt;fqhn&gt;"
              (where  &lt;fqhn&gt;  is  the fully-qualified hostname of the server).
              If the server is running with some other DN, you  can  set  this
              environment  variable  to tell the MyProxy clients to accept the
              alternative DN.

<dd>   <B>X509_USER_CERT</B>
<dt>          Specifies a non-standard location for the certificate from which
              the proxy credential is created by <B>myproxy-init</B>.
              Also specifies  an alternative location for the server's certificate.
              By default, the server uses <I>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</I> when
              running  as  root or <I>~/.globus/usercert.pem</I> when running as non-
              root.

<dd>   <B>X509_USER_KEY</B>
<dt>          Specifies a non-standard location for the private key from which
              the proxy credential is created by <B>myproxy-init</B>.
              Also specifies an alternative location for the server's private  key.
              By  default, the server uses <I>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</I> when
              running as root or <I>~/.globus/userkey.pem</I> when  running  as  non-
              root.

<dd>   <B>X509_USER_PROXY</B>
<dt>          Specifies  an  alternative location for the server's certificate
              and private key (in the same file).  Use when running the server
              with  a  proxy  credential.  Note that the proxy will need to be
              periodically renewed before expiration  to  allow  the  <B>myproxy-</B>
              <B>server</B> to keep functioning.  When the <B>myproxy-server</B> runs with a
              non-host credential, clients  must  have  the  <B>MYPROXY_SERVER_DN</B>
              environment  variable  set to the distinguished name of the cer-
              tificate being used by the server.

<dd>   <B>GLOBUS_LOCATION</B>
<dt>          Specifies the root of the MyProxy installation, used to find the
              default location of the <I>myproxy-server.config</I> file and the  cre-
              dential storage directory.

<dd>   <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>
<dt>          The  MyProxy  server is typically linked dynamically with Globus
              security  libraries,  which  must  be  present  in  the  dynamic
              linker's  search  path.   This  typically requires <I>$GLOBUS</I><B>_</B><I>LOCA-</I>
              <I>TION/lib</I> to be included in the list in the <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B> envi-
              ronment   variable,   which   is   set   by   the  <I>$GLOBUS</I><B>_</B><I>LOCA-</I>
              <I>TION/libexec/globus-script-initializer</I> script, which  should  be
              called  from  any <B>myproxy-server</B> startup script.  Alternatively,
              to set <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B> appropriately for the Globus libraries in
              an  interactive  shell, source <I>$GLOBUS</I><B>_</B><I>LOCATION/etc/globus-user-</I>
              <I>env.sh</I>   (for   sh   shells)   or   <I>$GLOBUS</I><B>_</B><I>LOCATION/etc/globus-</I>
              <I>user.env.csh</I> (for csh shells).
