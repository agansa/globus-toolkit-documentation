MyProxy is an online credential repository.
    You can store X.509 <glossterm linkend="proxy-cred">proxy credentials</glossterm> in the MyProxy repository,
protected by a passphrase,
for later retrieval over the network. This 
    eliminates the need for manually copying <glossterm linkend="priv-key">private key</glossterm> and certificate
files between machines.
MyProxy can also be used for authentication to grid portals and
credential renewal with job managers.
