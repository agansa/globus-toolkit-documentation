  <para>Users who run clients can programatically set up the authorization scheme to enforce

 on a per invocation basis. The properties and

configuration information required depends on the configured

authorization scheme.  <xref linkend="s-authzframe-public-domain"/>

    <title>No authorization with delegation fails</title>

    <para>On using GSI Secure Conversation delegation of credentials cannot be done if no authorization of the server is done (that is if client side authorization is set to none). Use any other form of authorization while delegating.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, <ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/security/delegation/">Delegation Service</ulink> can be used to delegate credentials, in a scenario where delegated credentials are required by no authorization of server is required.</para>

    <important>

      <para>Delegating credentials without authorizing server is not recommended since a malicious server can obtain the client&apos;s credential.</para>
