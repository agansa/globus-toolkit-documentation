    <title>Client side authorization</title>
    <para>Client authorization of the server is done after the completion of the operation when GSI Secure Message authentication is used. If you require client authorization to be done prior, use GSI Secure Conversation or GSI <glossterm baseform="transport-level security">Transport security</glossterm>.</para>

    <title>Host authorization</title>
<para>During host authorization, the toolkit treats DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot; as equivalent to &quot;hostname.edu&quot;. This means that if a service was setup to do host authorization and hence accept the certificate &quot;hostname.edu&quot;, it would also accept certificates with DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot;. </para> 

<para> The feature is in place to allow a multi-homed host folowing a &quot;hostname-interface&quot; naming convention, to have a single host certificate. For example, host &quot;grid.test.edu&quot; would also accept likes of &quot;grid-1.test.edu&quot; or &quot;grid-foo.test.edu&quot;. </para>

<note><simpara>The wildcard character &quot;*&quot; matches only name of the hostand not domain components. This means that &quot;hostname.edu&quot; will not match &quot;hostname-foo.sub.edu&quot;, but will match &quot;host-foo.edu&quot;.</simpara></note>

<note><simpara>If a host was set up to accept &quot;hostname-1.edu&quot;, it will not accept any of &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot;.</simpara></note>



<para>A <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2969">bug</ulink> has been opened to see if this feature needs to be modfiied.
