	    <title>Configure SimpleCA for multiple machines </title>
	    <para>So far, you have a single machine configured with SimpleCA
	        certificates. Recall that in <xref linkend="simpleca-confirmcert"/>
	        a
	        CA setup package was created in <filename>.globus/simpleCA/globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz</filename>.
	        If you want to use your certificates on another machine, you
	        must install that CA setup package on that machine.             
	    </para>
	    <para>To install it, copy that package to the second machine and run:
<screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz gcc32dbg
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-postinstall</screen>
	    </para>
	    <para>Then you will have to perform <command>setup-gsi -default</command> from 
	        <xref linkend="simpleca-finalizing"/>.
	    </para>
	    <para>If you are going to run services on the second host, it will need
	        its own host certificate (<xref linkend="simpleca-hostcert"/>)
	        and grid-mapfile (as described in the basic configuration instructions
	        in <xref linkend="s-basic-gridmap"/>).
	    </para>
		<para>You may re-use your <glossterm linkend="user-cert">user certificates</glossterm> on the new host. You will
	        need to copy the requests to the host where the SimpleCA was
	        first installed in order to sign them.
	    </para>
