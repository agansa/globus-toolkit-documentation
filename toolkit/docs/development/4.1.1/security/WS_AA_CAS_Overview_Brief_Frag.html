CAS allows a virtual organization to express policy regarding
resources distributed across a number of sites. A CAS server issues
assertions to the virtual organization users which grant them
fine-grained access rights to resources. Servers recognize and
enforce the assertions. CAS is designed to be extensible to multiple
services and is currently supported for GridFTPD.
