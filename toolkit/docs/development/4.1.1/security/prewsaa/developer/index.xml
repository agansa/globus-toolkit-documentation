<title>GT 4.0 Pre-WS Authentication and Authorization: Developer's Guide</title>
<titleabbrev>Developer's Guide</titleabbrev>
<section id="s-prewsaa-developer-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>This component provides a API for authentication and two APIs for
authorization.</para> 
<para>The authentication API is a implementation of the
GSS-API (RFC 2743 and RFC 2744) extended with functions described in
the GSS-API Extensions document.</para> 
<para> On the authorization front there is a coarse grained API, which in
 addition to authorizing also provides a mapping function, and a API
 that allows for finer grained authorization decisions to be made. The
 finer grained API follows the subject, object, action paradigm.
 </para>
<para>
Both of the authorization APIs allow different backend implementations 
through the use of dynamic libary loading.

<section><title>Authentication</title>
<para>As mentioned in the introduction, the pre-WS security framework uses 
the GSSAPI API and extensions to it to abstract security mechanism specific 
details. Below the GSSAPI layer there exist multiple APIs for dealing with 
credential management, X.509 certificates in general and proxy certificates 
in particular as well as security configuration. Each of these APIs is 
described in more detail below.</para>
<para>The general design principle guiding these APIs is object orientation. 
Datastructures (handles and attributes) capture and encapsulate the state 
of the system. These data structures are then acted upon by various getters 
and setters as well as other functions.</para>
</section>
<section><title> The GSS Assist API</title>
<para>The GSS Assist API provides helper functions wrapping the process of security (GSS) 
context establishment, support for gridmap authorization and various other helper 
function that wrap GSSAPI functions and capture common usage.</para>
</section>
<section><title>GSSAPI</title>
<para>The GSSAPI implementation provided by the toolkit is based upon SSL/TLS with 
extensions to the standard path validation to handle proxy certificates. It relies 
upon the credential and certificate utilities APIs for general certificate acquisition 
and inspection functionality.</para>
</section>
<section><title>The Callback API</title>
<para>This API provides a callback that can be plugged into the OpenSSL path validation 
framework. This callback provides the additions to path validation required for dealing 
with proxy certificates. Furthermore, it allows applications to inspect data, e.g. the 
validated certificate chain, after the validation is done.</para>
</section>
<section><title>The Certificate Utilities API</title>
<para>The Certificate Utilities API provides helper functions for dealing with X.509 
certificates. This API does not use the "handle" concept mentioned in the introduction. 
Rather it operates on datatypes provided by the OpenSSL APIs.</para>
