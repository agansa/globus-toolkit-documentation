  <title>Credential Errors</title>
  <para>The following are some common problems that may cause clients or servers
to report that credentials are invalid:
</para>
  <section>
    <title>Your proxy credential may have expired</title>
    <para>Use <command>grid-proxy-info</command> to check whether the proxy has actually
expired.  If it has, generate a new proxy with <command>grid-proxy-init</command>.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>The system clock on either the local or remote system is wrong</title>
    <para>This may cause the server or client to conclude that a credential has
expired.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Your end-user certificate may have expired</title>
    <para>Use <command>grid-cert-info</command> to check your certificate&apos;s expiration
date.  If it
has expired, follow your CA&apos;s procedures to get a new
one.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>The permissions may be wrong on your proxy file</title>
    <para>If the permissions on your proxy file are too lax (for example, if others
can read your proxy file), Globus Toolkit clients will not use that file
to authenticate.  You can &quot;fix&quot; this problem by changing the permissions
on the file or by destroying it (with <command>grid-proxy-destroy</command>and
creating a new one (with <command>grid-proxy-init</command>).  However, it is still
possible that someone else has made a copy of that file during the time
that the permissions were wrong.  In that case, they will be able to
impersonate you until the proxy file expires or your permissions or
end-user certificate are revoked, whichever happens first.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>The permissions may be wrong on your private key file</title>
    <para>If the permissions on your end user certificate private key file are too lax
(for example, if others can read the file), <command>grid-proxy-init</command> will
refuse to create a proxy certificate.  You can &quot;fix&quot; this by changing the
permissions on the private key file; however, you will still have a much
more serious problem:  it&apos;s possible that someone has made a copy of
your private key file.  Although this file is encrypted, it is possible
that someone will be able to decrypt the private key, at which point they
will be able to impersonate you as long as your end user certificate is valid.
You should contact your CA to have your end-user certificate revoked and
get a new one.

  <section>
    <title>The remote system may not trust your CA</title>
    <para>Verify that the remote system is configured to trust the CA that issued
your end-entity certificate.  See the [TODO:  add admin guide link] for
details.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>You may not trust the remote system&apos;s CA</title>
    <para>Verify that your system is configured to trust the remote CA (or that
your environment is set up to trust the remote CA).  See the [TODO:  
add admin guide link] for details.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>There may be something wrong with the remote service&apos;s credentials</title>
    <para>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between errors reported by the
remote service regarding your credentials and errors reported by the
client interface regarding the remote service&apos;s credentials.  If you
can&apos;t find anything wrong with your credentials, check for the same
conditions (or ask a remote administrator to do so) on the remote system.
