<p>The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) is a WSRF based 
service that provides interfaces for controlling and monitoring third party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfer is hosted
inside of a Grid service so it can be managed using the soft state model. It
  is  essentially a reliable and recoverable version of the GT2 <code>globus-url-copy</code> tool
   and more. </p>
