<p>The Replica location Service (RLS) allows the registration and discovery of replicas. An RLS maintains and provides access to mapping information from logical names for data items to target names. These target names may represent physical locations of data items or an entry in the RLS may map to another level of logical naming for the data item. The Replica Location Service design consists of two components. Local Replica Catalogs (LRCs) maintain consistent information about logical-to-physical mappings on a site or storage system. The Replica Location Indexes (RLIs) aggregate state information contained in one or more LRCs and build a global, hierarchical distributed index to support discovery of replicas at multiple sites. LRCs send summaries of their state to RLIs using soft state update protocols. The server consists of a multi-threaded front end server and a back-end relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The front end server can be configured to act as an LRC server and/or an RLI server. Clients access the server via a simple string-based RPC protocol. The client APIs support C, Java and Python. The APIs contain operations to create and delete mappings, associate attributes with mappings, and perform queries.
