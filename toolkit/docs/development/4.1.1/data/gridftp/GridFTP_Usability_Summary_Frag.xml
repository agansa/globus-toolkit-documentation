<para>The following areas have received substantial effort in order to make using GridFTP easier, 
    more enjoyable, etc:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>100% protocol compatability with previous versions.  Any client / server combination since 2.4.0 
should work (barring a new client trying to invoke new functionality on an old server)
</listitem>
<listitem>Greatly improved documentation.  It is not complete, and we will continue to develop it, but it is far 
better than past versions.</listitem>
<listitem>
For GT4.0.0 there is a completely new server implementation, this provides the following benefits:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>More stable (one project went from on the order of 1000 failures in a large workflow with the 2.4.3 server to zero failures with the new server)</listitem>
<listitem>More scalable (we had a single server supporting 1800 clients)</listitem>
<listitem>Easier to extend, modify (The Data Storage Interface (DSI) allows a clean way to access things other than POSIX file systems, such as tape systems, custom storage systems, etc)</listitem>
<listitem>Ability to run threaded (previous versions of the server were not supported running threaded)</listitem>
<listitem>Striping is now available (allows multi-Gigabit speeds)</listitem>
<listitem>Easier server configuration</listitem>
