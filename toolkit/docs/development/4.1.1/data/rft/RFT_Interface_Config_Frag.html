<h3>Configuration overview</h3>
PostgreSQL (Version 7.1 or greater ) needs to
be installed and configured&nbsp; for RFT to work. The instructions on
how to install/configure postgresql can be found <a
 href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/installation/install_config_rft.html#settinguppostgresql">here
</a>(add a link to instuctions here). <br>
<ol>
  <li><a name="step1"></a>Install Postgresql. Configure the postmaster daemon so that it
accepts TCP connections. This can be done by adding -o "-i" switch to
postmaster script.</li>
  <li>To create the database that is used for RFT, run:<br> 
    <code>createdb rftDatabase</code></li>
  <li>To populate the RFT database with appropriate schemas, run:<br> 
    <code>psql -d rftDatabase -f $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft/rft_schema.sql<br>
    <br>
    </code>Now
    that you have created a database to store RFT's state, the following steps
    configure RFT to find the database:<br>
  </li>
  <li>Open <code> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_rft/jndi-config.xml</code></li>
  <li>Find the
    <code>dbConfiguration</code> section under <code>ReliableFileTransferService &lt;service&gt;</code> section. </li>
  <li>Change the <code>connectionString</code> to point to the machine on which
    you installed Postgres and name of the database you used in step 2. <br>
    If you installed
    Postgres on the same machine as your
Globus install, the default should work fine for you.</li>
  <li>Change the <code>userName</code> to the name of the user who owns/created
    the database and do the same for the password. (It also depends on how
    you configured your database.)</li>
  <li>Don't worry about the other parameters in that section. The
  defaults should work fine for now.</li>
  <li>Edit the configuration section under
    <code>ReliableFileTransferService</code>. There are two values that can be
  edited in this section. </li>

<ul>
  <li><code>backOff</code>&nbsp; : Time in seconds you want RFT to backoff before
a failed transfer is retried by RFT. Default should work fine for now.</li>
  <li><code>maxActiveAllowed</code>:&nbsp; This is the number of transfers the
container can do at given point. Default should be fine for now.</li>
</ul></ol>
  <h3>Frequent configuration problems</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If RFT is not configured properly to talk to a PostgreSQL
  database, you will see this message displayed on the console when
  you start the container : </p>
  <pre>"Error creating RFT Home: Failed to connect to database ... 
Until this is corrected all RFT request will fail and all GRAM jobs that require staging will fail". </pre>
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Usual mistake is Postmaster is not accepting
    TCP connections which&nbsp; means that you have to restart Postmaster with
  -i option&nbsp; ( see <a href="#step1">step 1</a>) </p>
<h3>Syntax of the interface</h3>
<p> The security configuration of the service can be modifying the
  security descriptor. It allows for configuring in the credentials that
  will be used by the service, type of authentication and authorization
  that needs to be enforced. By default, the following security
  configuration is installed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credentials set for use by container is used. If that is not
        specified, default credentials are used. </li>
  <li>GSI Secure conversation authentication is enforced for all
        methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Changing required authentication and authorization
method will require suitable changes to the clients that contact this
service. </p>
<p>To alter security descriptor configuration refer to <a
 href="../../security/authzframe/security_descriptor.html">Security
  Descriptors</a>.
  The file to be altered is <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_rft/security-config.xml</code></p>
