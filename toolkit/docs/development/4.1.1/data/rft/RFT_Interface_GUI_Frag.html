<h3>Overview of the purpose and functionality of the GUI</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Command line client for RFT transfers:
</span>To submit a transfer to the Reliable
File Transfer Service and prints out the status of the transfer on the
console.<br>
<br>
<h4>Command and options: </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rft&nbsp; [-h &lt;host-ip of the container default
8080&gt; -l &lt;lifetime for the resource default 60mins&gt; -z
&lt;authorization mechanism can be self or host. default self&gt; ] -f
&lt;path to the file that contains list of transfers&gt;<br>
This is a sample transfer file that the command line client will be
able to parse, it can also be found in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_wsrf_rft_client/ along with other samples
for directory transfers and delete: <br>

<h3>Limitations :</h3>
This command line client is very dumb and simple and does not do any
intelligent parsing of various command line options and the options in
the sample transfer file. It works fine if used in the way documented
here.<br>
