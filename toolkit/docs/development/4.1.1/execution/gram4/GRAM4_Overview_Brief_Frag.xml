  comprises a set of WSRF-compliant Web services to locate, submit, monitor,
  and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. WS GRAM is not a <glossterm>job scheduler</glossterm>,

  different batch/cluster job schedulers using a common protocol. WS GRAM is
  meant to address a range of jobs where reliable operation, stateful
  monitoring, credential management, and file staging are important.
