<h3><font color="purple">Java-based Tool for Submitting Jobs</font> 
to <font color="purple">GRAM Services</font></h3>

<h4>Tool description</h4>
<p><font color="purple">
This is the job submission tool for the Globus Toolkit 3.9.3. The job 
startup is done by submitting a client-side provided job description 
to the GRAM services.<p>
<p>
In addition to starting jobs, it is possible to query the state of a previously 
started job and parse a job description file without making any submission.<p>
<p>
The existence of a valid proxy is required for essentially all
supported operations but job description file parsing (<code>-p</code>).

<h4>Tool-triggered Automatic Job Resource Destruction</h4>
<p><p><font color="purple">
 <p>
 Execution errors and user interrupt events are handled by automatically
 destroying the requested job service(s), unless the -batch option
 is on the command-line. The -batch option prevents the tool from
 listening to job state changes and from waiting for the job to finish.
 If -batch is selected, the command will return as soon as the remote
 job has been submitted.
 <p>
 The behavior of the tool with respect to job service destruction will vary
 in response to several kinds of events:
 <ul>
 <li> The command exits normally after the job(s) finish(es), and destroys
      the job service(s) it requested. In batch mode, the requested job
      is never destroyed.
  <li> The command is terminated in response to a user interrupt, such as
      typing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em>, or a system-wide event, such as user logoff or system
      shutdown. If the -no-interrupt option is on the command-line,
      and the command-line has been successfully parsed when the interrupt
      occurs, the tool does not destroy any job service(s) it requested.
      Otherwise the tool destroys the requested job service(s).
  <li> In case of any error of execution, the command will exit and
      destroy the job(s) it successfully requested.
 </ul>
 <p>
 <p>
 If the Java virtual machine of the tool aborts, that is, stops running without shutting down
 cleanly, for instance because it received a SIGKILL signal on Unix, then no
 guarantee can be made about whether or not the job service(s) will be
 destroyed.
 <p>
 Note: the shutdown behavior explained above cannot be guaranteed if the
 JVM option -Xrs is entered.
 The recommended way to disable service destruction is to specify
 the -batch option on the command-line.
</font></p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><font color="purple">

With the command:<p>

% bin/managed-job-globusrun -f share/gram-client/test.xml<p>

The output should be:<p>

SubmissionID: uuid:661AA7F0-2573-11D9-99B2-D4755757F903
WAITING FOR JOB TO FINISH
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: CleanUp
========================================
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: Done
========================================
Exit Code: 0
DESTROYING SERVICE
========== State Notification ==========
Job State: Active
========================================
SERVICE DESTROYED

<p>
In this example the job description specifies the standard output 
stream path of the job to be: ${GLOBUS_USER_HOME}/stdout. The GRAM 
services replace the substitution variable ${GLOBUS_USER_HOME} 
with the path to the Home directory of the submitting user 
as seen by the machine were the invoked GRAM services are hosted.
You can thus verify the output of the job with the following 
command:<p>

% cat ~/stdout
<p>
which will display the string:<p>
12 abc 34 pdscaex_instr_GrADS_grads23_28919.cfg pgwynnel was here

<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p><font color="purple">

With the porting of existing GRAM functionality from OGSI to WSRF, 
this new version of the job submission tool suffers from a few limitations 
comparatively to previous versions of the tool.
These limitations will be dealt with in the next version of the tool, which 
will be implemented in C and thus will also be more performant.

<p><h5>No more file staging using GASS</h5><p>
The GASS server is not being used anymore by GRAM, so the options 
-server and -write are not available anymore. This is not a limitation 
per se, since instead, file staging is done in a reliable fashion 
by using GridFTP servers installed on the client machine and 
the remote machine hosting the GRAM services. The file staging directives 
in the job description must now contain paths that can be resolved 
to GridFTP URLs.
TODO add link to HowTo StageFiles here.
<p>

<p><h5>No standard output redirection yet</h5><p>
Unlike the GT3.2 managed-job-globusrun used with the option -output, 
this version of the tool does not offer any streamed redirection of 
the standard streams. This is because the GASS server is not used anymore 
by GRAM. Instead, a future version of the tool will allow for streaming 
of any server-side file (including the standard streams of the job 
execution) using GridFTP "tailing" of remote files.<p>

<p><h5>No listing of submitted jobs yet</h5><p>
The -list option, which made the 3.2 tool print the identifiers of the jobs 
submitted by the user on the standard output, is not available in this version 
of the tool.
