<section id="s-wsgram-developer-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This guide is intended to help a developer create compatible WS GRAM clients
and alternate service implementations.
</para>
<para>The key concepts for the GRAM component have not changed. Its purpose
  is still to provide the mechanisms to execute remote applications for a
  user. Given an RSL (Resource Specification Language) job description,
  GRAM submits the job to a scheduling system such as PBS or Condor, or
  to a simple fork-based way of spawning processes,
  and monitors it until completion. More details can be found here:</para>

<section id="s-wsgram-developer-archdes"><title>Architecture and design overview</title>

<para>  The GRAM services in GT 4.0 are WSRF compliant. One of the key
  concepts in the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/">WSRF</ulink> specification
  is the decoupling of a  service with the public &quot;state&quot; of the service
  in the interface via the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/faq.asp#wsrf12">implied
  resource pattern</ulink>.
  Following this concept, the data of GT 4.0 GRAM jobs is published
  as part of WSRF resources, while there is only one service
  to start jobs or query and monitor their state. This is different from the
   <ulink url="http://www.gridforum.org/ogsi-wg/drafts/draft-ggf-ogsi-gridservice-04_2002-10-04.pdf">OGSI</ulink> model
   of GT3 where each job was represented as a separate service. There is still
   a job factory service that can be called in order to create job instances
   (represented as WSRF resources). Each scheduling system that GRAM is interfaced
   with is represented as a separate factory resource. By making a call to the
   factory service while associating the call to  the appropriate factory resource,
   the job submitting actor can create  a job resource mapping to a job in the
   chosen scheduling system.</para>
