<p>GTCP is a service interface for telecontrol.  It is the
WSRF version of the NEESgrid Teleoperations Control Protocol (NTCP),
which is used to control heterogeneous physical and computational
simulations coupled in geographically-distributed earthquake
engineering experiments. It has also been used to control data
acquisition systems (triggering the collection of data) and
high-resolution cameras (triggering image acquisition) during
earthquake engineering experiments, and, to a lesser extent, to
control the positioning, focal length, etc. of electron microscopes
in a neuroscience application.
</p>
<p>GTCP exposes two interfaces:  a WSRF-compliant
service interface used by clients to control remote instruments and simulations,
and a "plugin" interface to facilitate integrating new backends (physical
or computational simulation platforms) to the GTCP server.  The plugin
interface is a Java interface definition that includes methods for
each platform-specific action; a new platform is integrated by writing
a class that implements this interface definition</p>
