                Note that this command can take several hours to complete.
                If you wish to have a log file of the build, use 
                <command>tee</command>:
            </para>
            <screen>globus$ make 2>&amp;1 | tee build.log</screen>
            <para>
                The syntax above assumes a Bourne shell. If you are
                using another shell, redirect stderr to stdout and
                then pipe it to <command>tee</command>.
            </para>
            <note>
                Using make in parallel mode (-j) is not entirely safe,
                and is not recommended.

		<screen>globus$ make install</screen>

			This completes your installation.  Now

			We recommend that you install any security
                        advisories available for your installation,
which are available from the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/advisories.html">
			Advisories page</ulink>.  You may also
be interested in subscribing to some <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/support.html#mailinglists">mailing lists</ulink> for general discussion
and security-related announcements.

    <!-- maybe provide link to additional instructions and a link to move on to configuring if they don't need the additional instructions -->
    <!-- add special subsection of install instructions for gridftp -->
    <!-- add instructions for building a package by itself - maybe a general commandline with table of options per package that includes links to config info -->
    <para>
	    Your next step is to setup security, which
	    includes picking a CA to trust,
	    getting host certificates, user certificates, 
	    and creating a grid-mapfile.  The next three
	    chapters cover these topics.
    </para>
    <para>
	    With security setup, you may start a GridFTP server, 
	    configure a database for RFT, and configure WS-GRAM.
	    You may also start a GSI-OpenSSH daemon, setup
	    a MyProxy server, run RLS, and use CAS.  The
	    following chapters will explain how to configure
	    these technologies.  If you follow the chapters
	    in order, you will make sure of performing tasks
	    in dependency order.
