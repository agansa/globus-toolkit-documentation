<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>WebMDS enables end users to view monitoring information via a standard
web browser interface, without installing any additional software on their
PC.  WebMDS is implemented as a servlet that uses a plugin interface to
gather monitoring information (or any other information in XML format) and
XSLT transforms, and present the data to the user in a readable form.
Web site administrators can customize their own WebMDS deployments by using
HTML form options, configuring different plugins to collect data and XSLT
transforms, and creating their own plugins and XSLT transforms.</p>
<p>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with WS MDS WebMDS. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation.</p>
<p>[put following paragraph in &lt;important&gt; element] <br>
This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, overview,

<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>
<p>WebMDS is built and installed as part of the standard Globus Toolkit
installation.</p>

<h2><a name="deploying"></a>Deploying</h2>
Because WebMDS is implemented as a servlet, it must be deployed into a servlet
container, such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>.
The following instructions assume that you've installed Tomcat version 5.0.28.
and set the $CATALINA_HOME environment
variable to the directory into which you've installed Tomcat.
<h3>Standard deployment into Tomcat 5.0.28</h3>
The standard deployment consists of two steps:  creating a configuration file
that tells Tomcat where to find the WebMDS servlet and related files, and
restarting Tomcat so that it will read this new configuration file.  These
steps require write permission on files and directories in
<code>$CATALINA_HOME</code>; they do not require write permission
on anything in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</code>.</p>
<p>To create the configuration file, run this command:</p>
<pre>
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds/bin/webmds-create-context-file \
         $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost
</pre>
<p>
This will create
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/webmds.xml</code>.
Note:  if this file already exists (e.g., if you've previously installed another
varsion of WebMDS), you'll need to use the <code>-f</code> option to
<code>webmds-create-context-file</code>.
</p>
<p>Next, restart Tomcat.  If Tomcat is already running, stop it:</p>
<pre>
    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
</pre>
<p>Then, start Tomcat:</p>
<pre>
    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh
</pre>
<h3>Custom deployment</h3>
If you are already running a Tomcat server (or other server that supports
servlets) and your preferred mechanism for
installing servlets is something other than creating a configuration file
and restarting your web server, feel free to use that mechanism.  The servlet
root for WebMDS is <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds</code>.
<p>
For the rest of these instructions, the term <i>Globus user</i> will be
used to refer to the owner of the <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</code> directory,
and <i>Tomcat user</i> will be used to refer to the owner of the
<code>$CATALINA_HOME</code> directory.  If the Globus and Tomcat installations
were performed from the same user account, the Globus user and Tomcat user
will be the same.
</p>
<p>
Any time you change the servlet configuration (or any jar files used by the
servlet), you'll need to let tomcat know there was a change.  If you have
a preferred way of configuring tomcat, feel free to use it, with
<code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds</code> as the servlet directory.
These steps need to be performed by the Tomcat user.
</p>
<p>
If you're using tomcat 5.0.28 and haven't done any custom configuration (such
as defining additional hosts) other than changing the tomcat port,
you can configure tomcat by doing the following:

<ol>

<li>Create a context descriptor file called <code>webmds.xml</code>
in the location where tomcat will look for it:

<pre>

    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/webmds/bin/webmds-create-context-file \
         $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost

</pre>

Note:  if the file
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/webmds.xml</code>
already exists, you can use the <code>-f</code> flag to
<code>create-context-file</code> to overwrite it.
to the tomcat configuration directory.
</li>
<li>If tomcat is running, shut it down.</li>
<pre>

    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

</pre>
<li>Start tomcat up.</li>
<pre>

    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

</pre>
</ol>
<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>
<p>The easiest way to test your installation is to use it to view your
index service, by pointing your web browser at
<code>http://<i>your-tomcat-host</i>:<i>your-tomcat-port</i>/webmds</code></strong> and clicking on the link labelled "A list of resources registered to
the local default index service".</p>
<h2><a name="security_considerations"></a>Security Considerations </h2>
<?php
include_once( "./../WS_MDS_WebMDS_Security_Considerations_Frag.html" );
?>
<h2><a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Error handling in WebMDS is currently done by throwing exceptions, which
are displayed by Tomcat as stack traces.  If you attempt to use WebMDS
to collect information from a service that is not running, you will see a 
stack trace that begins with:</p>
<pre>
org.globus.mds.webmds.xmlSources.resourceProperties.ResourcePropertySourceException: ; nested exception is: 
	java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
</pre>
<?php include("/mcs/www-unix.globus.org/include/globus_footer.inc"); ?>
