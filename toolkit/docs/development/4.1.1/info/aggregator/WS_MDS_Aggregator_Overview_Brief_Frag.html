<p>The WS-MDS Aggregator is the software framework on which WS-MDS services
(currently, the WS-MDS Index and WS-MDS Trigger services) are built.  The
aggregator framework collects data from an <i>aggregator source</i> and sends
that data to an <i>aggregator sink</i> for processing.  Aggregator sources
distributed with the Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data,
acquire data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to generate
data.  Aggregator sinks include modules that implement the WS-MDS Index service
interface and the WS-MDS Trigger service interface.</p>
