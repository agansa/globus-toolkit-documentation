<para>The Aggregator Framework is the software framework on which WS MDS
    services (currently, the WS MDS <glossterm linkend="index-service">Index</glossterm> and WS MDS <glossterm linkend="trigger-service">Trigger</glossterm> services)
are built. The aggregator framework collects data from an
    <glossterm linkend="aggregator-source">aggregator source</glossterm> and sends that data to an <emphasis>aggregator
sink</emphasis> for processing. Aggregator sources distributed with the
Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data, acquire
data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to
generate data. Aggregator sinks include modules that implement the
    WS MDS Index service interface and the WS MDS Trigger service
interface.</para>
