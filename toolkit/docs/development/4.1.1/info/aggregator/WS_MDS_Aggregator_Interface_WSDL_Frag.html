<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p>The aggregator builds on the WS-ServiceGroup and WS-ResourceLifetime
specifications. Those specifications should be consulted for details on 
the syntax of each operation.</p>

<p>Each aggregator is represented as a WS-ServiceGroup (an 
Aggregating ServiceGroup).</p>

<p>Resources may be registered to an 
aggregating ServiceGroup using the ServiceGroup add operation. Each
registration will be represented as a ServiceGroupEntry resource.
When a registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks
will be informed and aggregated data from the registered resource will
begin to flow via the aggregation source into the aggregation sink. The
method of collection by source and processing by the sink is 
dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator 
(see per-source documentation for source information and 
per-service documentation for sink information)</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>Each Aggregating ServiceGroup exposes an add operation. This is used
to register a specified resource with the aggregator. In addition to the
requirements made by the WS-ServiceGroup specification, the Content
element of each registration must be an AggregatorContent type, with
the AggregatorConfig element containing configuration information 
specific to each source and sink (documented elsewhere).</p>

<p>Each ServiceGroupEntry has a setTerminationTime operation, which can
be used to set the termination time of the registration, as detailed
in WS-ResourceLifetime.</p>

<h3>Resource properties</h3>

<p>Each aggregating ServiceGroup exposes an Entry resource property which 
publishes details of each registered resource, including both 
an EPR to the resource, the aggregator configuration information, and
data from the sink.</p>
<p>In addition, each aggregating ServiceGroup publishes registration
load information (the total number of registrations since service 
startup and decaying averages) in a RegistrationCount resource property.</p>
