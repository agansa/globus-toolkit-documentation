<h3>Protocol overview</h3>
<p>The aggregator framework builds on the WS-ServiceGroup and WS-ResourceLifetime
specifications. Those specifications should be consulted for details on 
the syntax of each operation.</p>

<p>Each aggregator framework is represented as a WS-ServiceGroup (specifically,
an 
AggregatorServiceGroup).</p>

<p>Resources may be registered to an 
AggregatorServiceGroup using the AggregatorServiceGroup Add operation. Each
registration will be represented as a ServiceGroupEntry resource.
Resources may be <i>registered</i> to an AggregatorServiceGroup using the
service group <code>add</code> operation, which will cause an entry
to be added to the service group.  The entry will include configuration
parameters for the aggregator source; when the
registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks will be informed; the aggregator source will begin collecting data and inserting it into
the corresponding service group entry, and the aggregator sink will begin
processing the information in the service group entries.
The
method of collection by source and processing by the sink is 
dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator framework 
(see per-source documentation for source information and 
per-service documentation for sink information.)</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>Each AggregatorServiceGroup exposes an Add operation. This is used
to register a specified resource with the aggregator framework. In addition to the
requirements made by the WS-ServiceGroup specification, the Content
element of each registration must be an AggregatorContent type, with
the AggregatorConfig element containing configuration information 
specific to each source and sink (documented elsewhere).</p>

<p>Each AggregatorServiceGroupEntry has a setTerminationTime operation, which can
be used to set the termination time of the registration, as detailed
in WS-ResourceLifetime.</p>

<h3>Resource properties</h3>

<p>Each AggregatorServiceGroup exposes an Entry resource property which 
publishes details of each registered resource, including both 
an EPR to the resource, the aggregator framework configuration information, and
data from the sink.</p>
<p>In addition, each AggregatorServiceGroup publishes registration
load information (the total number of registrations since service 
startup and decaying averages) in a RegistrationCount resource property.</p>
