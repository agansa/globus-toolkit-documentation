<para>By default, the <glossterm>aggregator sources</glossterm> do not use authentication
credentials -- they retrieve information using anonymous SSL
authentication or no authentication at all, and thus retrieve only
publicly-available information. If a user or administrator changes
that configuration so that a service's aggregator source uses
credentials to acquire non-privileged data, then that user or
administrator must configure the service's aggregator sink to limit
access to authorized users.</para>
