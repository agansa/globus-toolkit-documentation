<p>Although the basic functionality remains the same for MDS in GT4,
the architecture has changed from OGSI in GT3 to WSRF in GT4.  In
OGSI, services advertise <i>service data</i>; in WSRF, services advertise
<i>resource properties</i>.  Resource Properties and service data are
very similar -- both provide a mechanism for expressing arbitrary
data about grid resources in XML format, as well as query and
notification/subscription interfaces to that data.</p>
<p>The GT4 Index Service provides the same functionality as the GT3
Index service; however, the GT4 Index Service supports WSRF service
group registration and resource property query
and subscription/notification mechanisms, while the GT3 Index Service
supported OGSI service group registration and service data 
query and subscription/notification mechanisms.</p>
<p>The following table shows a mapping of some GT3 concepts/tools to GT4.</p>

<th>Description</th>
<th>GT2 Version</th>
<th>GT4 Version</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Query Operations</td>
<td>FindServiceData (to retrieve a single service data element by name or to
perform an XPath query against a service's service data elements)</td>
<td>GetResourceProperty (to retrieve a single resource property by name),
GetMultipleResourceProperties (to retrieve multiple resource properties by name),
and QueryResourceProperties (to perform an XPath query against a service's
resource properties).</td>

<td>APIs used for queries</td>
<td>OGSI (GT3) Core APIs</td>
<td>WS Core APIs</td>

<td>Command-line clients used for queries</td>
<td><code>ogsi-find-service-data</code></td>
<td><code>wsrf-get-property</code>, <code>wsrf-get-properties</code>,
<code>wsrf-query</code></td>

<tr>
<td>Index registration mechanism</td>
<td>GT3 services can be configured to publish their service data
to index services.</td>
<td>Index Servers maintain aggregating service groups that
include registration information (timeout values, the mechanism to
use to acquire information, and additional mechanism-specific parameters)
The registration is accomplished by
adding an entry to an aggregating service group via the 
<code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> command.  In addition, services
may be configured to register themselves to the default index server
running in the same container.</td>
