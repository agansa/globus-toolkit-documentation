<titleabbrev>Release Notes</titleabbrev>

<section id="nagios-rn-overview"><title>Component Overview</title>
    
    <!-- This is where you describe the information provider (pulled into both the release notes and the reference page). 
    This should be simply one paragraph, so paste your text in between the para tags below. -->
    
    <para>
    This information provider gathers data from a Nagios system and
    publishes it into the MDS4 in the standard GLUE schema.

    The official Nagios site states the following: "Nagios is a host
    and service monitor designed to inform you of network problems
    before your clients, end-users or managers do. It has been
    designed to run under the Linux operating system, but works fine
    under most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring daemon runs
    intermittent checks on hosts and services you specify using
    external plugins which return status information to Nagios. When
    problems are encountered, the daemon can send notifications out to
    administrative contacts in a variety of different ways (email,
    instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status information,
    historical logs, and reports can all be accessed via a web
    browser."

<section id="nagios-rn-featuresummary"><title>Feature Summary</title>

    <!-- This is for our release notes and describes the 'features' of this info provider - in other words, the reasons why someone would want to use this provider. 
    You can simply paste your information below the code. If you want to use the docbook code, for each feature, put text in between the para tags. To add another listitem, copy the
    line with listitem and paste below (but before the /itemizedlist closing tag). You can do this as many times as you need. -->

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
        The Nagios MDS4 Information Provider gets its information
        directly from the Nagios v. 2.x status.dat file. (Support
        remains for the v 1.3 status.log file in the form of the
        alternate script globus-mds-cluster-nagios1.3) It includes
        some custom plugins that return the data in a format that the
        information provider can use.
