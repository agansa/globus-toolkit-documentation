<para>The WS MDS Index Service collects information about grid
resources and publishes that information as a service group. Client
programs use resource property queries or subscription/notification
to retrieve information from the index. Information can be added to
the index via a number of different mechanisms: since the Index
Service is implemented using the Aggregator Framework, any
aggregator source can be used to provide information for the
index.</para>

<section id="s-index-developer-archdes"><title>Architecture and design
overview</title>
<para>There are essentially two interfaces to the Index Service -- one
for getting information into the index, and one for retrieving
information from the index.</para>
<para>Information is retrieved from the Index Service as service group
entries using the standard WS MDS Core APIs for resource property
    queries or subscription/notification.</para>
    <para>Because the Index is implemented as a WS MDS Aggregator Framework, the programmatic interface for getting information into
the index is to create an aggregator source -- see the <ulink url=
    "../aggregator/developer-index.html">WS MDS Aggregator Framework Developer's
Guide</ulink> for details.</para>

</section>
<section><title>Retrieving information from an index service</title>
<para>Information is retrieved from the index using the standard Java
WS Core API calls for getting resource property information:
<computeroutput>GetResourceProperty</computeroutput> to request a single resource
property by name, <computeroutput>GetResourceProperties</computeroutput> to request
several resource properties by name,
<computeroutput>QueryResourceProperty</computeroutput> to perform an XPath query on a
resource property document, and the notification/subscription
mechanism. See the <ulink url=
"../../common/javawscore/developer-index.html">Java WS Core Developer's
Guide</ulink> for details.</para>
</section>
<section><title>Adding information to an index</title>
Information is added to an index by way of an <emphasis>aggregator
source</emphasis>. The Globus Toolkit distribution includes several
standard aggregator sources (see the <ulink url=
"admin-index.html">Administrator's Guide</ulink> for more details). To create
your own custom information source, see the <ulink url=
    "../aggregator/developer-index.html">WS MDS Aggregator Framework Developer's
Guide</ulink>.

<para>See the <ulink url=

the Java WS Core Developer's Guide</ulink> for general information on
logging, including which files to edit to set logging
properties.</para>
<para>To turn on debug logging for the Index Service, add the
line:</para>

log4j.category.org.globus.mds.index=DEBUG

<para>to the appropriate properties file. Since the Index Service is
implemented using the aggregator framework, you may also want to
turn on aggregator debugging by adding this line:</para>
