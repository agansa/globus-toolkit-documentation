<para>The Index Service is built and installed as part of a default GT
4.0 installation. For basic installation instructions, see the
<ulink url="../../../admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's
Guide</ulink>. No extra installation steps are required for this
component.</para>

<para>The entire content of the default index service in a deployment
can be seen by executing the following command, which will dump the
entire RP set of the service:</para>

Troubleshooting</title>
<para>If an index entry has AggregatorConfig data but an empty
AggregatorData entry, there is probably something wrong with the
registration. For example, a registration that uses
QueryAggregatorSource aggregator source may have incorrect values
for the resource's hostname or port number or a misspelled resource
property name, or the remote resource may impose security
restrictions that prevent the queries from the index from working.
You can use the standard toolkit resource property query tools
(such as <command>wsrf-get-properties</command>) to verify that the
remote resource is responding.</para>
