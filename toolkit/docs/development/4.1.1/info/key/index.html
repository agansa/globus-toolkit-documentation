<h2><a name=overview></a>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't done so already, we recommend reading
  the <a href="#">GT4 Key Concepts guide</a> before continuing. Also keep in
  mind that in this documentation, the concepts of MDS are written for the latest
  version, WS MDS (also known as MDS4). The GT4 release includes the Pre-WS component,
  MDS2, for legacy purposes only - it will be deprecated at some future time
  as experience is gained with the WS implementation (for information about MDS2,
  click <a href="http://www.globus.org/mds/mds2/">here</a>.) </p>
<p>The Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS) component of Globus Toolkit V4
  (GT4) can streamline the tasks of monitoring and discovering services and resources  in a distributed system or Grid :</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Monitoring</em> is the process of observing Grid resources (e.g.,
    computers and schedulers), for such purposes as fixing problems and tracking
    usage. For example, a user might use a monitoring system to identify resources
    that are running low on disk space, in order to take corrective action.</li>
  <li><em>Discovery</em> is the process of finding a suitable Grid resource to
    perform a task: for example, finding a compute host on which to run a job.
    This process may involve both finding which Grid resources are suitable (e.g.,
    have the correct CPU architecture) and choosing a suitable member from that
    set (e.g., the one with the shortest submission queue).</li>
</ul>
<font color="#800080"></font>
<p>Both monitoring and discovery applications require the ability to collect
   information about Grid resources from multiple, perhaps distributed,
  sources (referred to as<em> information sources</em>.) To meet this need, WS MDS provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>so-called <em>aggregator services</em> (primarily the MDS-Index service)
    that collect recent state information from registered Grid resources, and
    then [does something with it.]</li>
  <li>browser-based interfaces, command
    line tools, and Web service interfaces that allow users/machines
  to query and access the collected information.</li>
</ul>
<p>WS MDS is based on the <a href="link_to_WSRF_info">WSRF</a> implementation. It makes heavy use
  of XML and Web service interfaces to simplify the tasks of registering information
  sources and locating and accessing information of interest. In particular,
  all information collected by aggregator services is maintained as XML, and
  can be queried via XPath queries (as well as other Web services mechanisms.) </p>
<p>WS MDS has similar features to, but does not interoperate
      with MDS2. The following  is a
    breakdown of the differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More powerful query language: XPath instead of LDAP
[Is xpath more powerful?  --Laura]</li>
  <li>Simpler
        and therefore more robust implementation, due to fewer components [ben's
    not sure about this] </li>
  <li>GT 4.0 Final is intended to have simpler
          (indeed, in simple cases, totally automated) configuration, due to
    fewer components and tight integration with the GT4 implementation</li>
  <li>Convenient
            interface to arbitrary information sources due to extensible architecture.
[Wasn't this also true of MDS2?  --Laura]</li>
  <li>No
              requirement for pre-defined schema in information providers. </li>
  <li>Different performance characteristics:  in some cases, lower performance
    than MDS2 (such as raw query rate) due to the immaturity of the underlying
    technologies, while in other places higher performance due to architectural
    changes (such as removal of cascading queries.)</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="purple">[TODO: mention differences with GT3's version of WS MDS
    - may make a table] </font></p>
<h2><a
name=concepts></a>Conceptual details</h2>
<p>This section will define the major players of WS MDS, then describe how
  they fit together in a basic framework:</p>

</ul>
<h3><a name="gridresources"></a>Grid resources</h3>
<p><em>Grid resources</em> are essentially any entity in a virtual organization
  (VO) from which a user wants to obtain information: for example, a file, a
program, a Web service, or another network-enabled service. </p>
<h3><a name="infosources"></a>Information sources</h3>
<p><em>Information sources</em> are basically sources of information about a
  Grid resource you want to monitor. An information source collects the information
  from the Grid resource and formats it so that it is compatible with WS MDS.
  Information sources can either be Java classes in the Aggregator framework
or executables. </p>
<p>Java classes are supported for WSRF-compliant Web services.   Such services
  need simply to&nbsp;make
  status and state information available as WSRF resource properties .&nbsp;The
  following can be specified: </p>
<ul>
  <li>use resource property operations to <em>pull</em> resource properties, <br>
    &lt;poll-source-name&gt;, a Java
    class which polls WSRF services for resource properties / <br>
    using the WSRF &ldquo;get
    resource property&rdquo; interface; or </li>
  <li> subscribe to resource property changes so that values are <em>pushed</em> via
    WS-Notification subscription methods.<br>
    &lt;subscribe-source-name&gt;, a Java class which receives resource properties
  from WSRF services through subscription/notification  </li>
</ul>
<p>Executables are user-supplied programs that 
  allow information to be obtained from an arbitrary Grid resource (whether or
  not it's a WSRF-compliant Web service). The program runs periodically to obtain
  up-to-date data and can either generate the information locally
  or use a source-specific protocol to access the information remotely. The program
  must convert non-XML data into an appropriate XML representation.</p>
<h4>GT4's built-in information sources </h4>
<p>GT4 is configured to use WS MDS components for discovery and monitoring of
GT4 services and provides built-in information sources, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two GT4 services, GRAM and RFT, also publish a larger set of service-specific
    information. These values are documented in the service descriptions for
    GRAM and RFT <font color="purple">[provide list/links]</font> and also in
    the <a href="#">GT4 resource properties catalog</a>.</li>
  <li>The following are intended to be implemented for GT 4.0 Final:
      <ul>
        <li>Every GT4 service supports a minimal set of resource properties (an
          informal service name and a service startup time) and thus can be registered
          easily into one or more aggregator services for monitoring and discovery. <font color="purple">[provide
          list/links]</font></li>
        <li>The GT4 distribution also includes information source executables
          to enable registering GridFTP and RLS (which are <strong>not</strong> WSRF-compliant
          Web services) into aggregator services <font color="purple">[provide
          list/links].</font></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="aggregatorservices"></a>Aggregator services </h3>
<p>A service that collects information using the WS-MDS aggregator framework,
and then [does something with it]. WS-MDS includes two aggregator services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>MDS-Index, which is the main component
  for collecting structured data from information sources and making the information
    available via a Web Services interface. </li>
  <li>MDS-Trigger, which passes this information to an executable (configured
    by the administrator), which may take an action such as sending email.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A third aggregator service is planned: an MDS-Archive, which will maintain
  an archive of historical information.</p>
<p>WS MDS aggregator services are distinguished from a traditional static registry
  such as UDDI by their soft-state registration of information sources and periodic
  refresh of the structured data that they store. This dynamic behavior enables
  scalable discovery by allowing users to access &ldquo;recent&rdquo; information
without accessing the information sources directly. </p>
<p>However, note that the information obtained may not be the absolute latest.
  Also, as aggregator services do not interpret policy information, there is
  no guarantee that a user will be allowed to access a service discovered in
  this way.</p>
<h4>MDS-Index service</h4>
<p>The <em>MDS-Index</em> service makes the collected data available as XML documents.
More specifically, the data is maintained as WSRF resource properties, thus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can write their own applications that collect information using <em>Web
      services interfaces</em>, namely the WSRF get-property and WS-Notification
      subscribe operations, for which GT4 provides C, Java, and Python APIs.</li>
  <li>The command line tool <a href="../../common/javawscore/user/index.html#wsrf-get-property"><code>wsrf-get-property</code></a> can
    be used to retrieve resource properties, with the desired resource property
    specified via an XPath expression.
[I think you're confusing two tools -- wsrf-query lets you specify an xpath query; wsrf-get-property lets you get a single resource property (specified as the name of the resource property, which is a QName, not an xpath query).  -- Laura]</li>
  <li>A tool called <a href="../../techpreview/webmds/">WebMDS</a> presents MDS-Index information in a standard web browser.
    WebMDS is highly configurable, using XSLT transformations to describe how
    MDS-Index resource properties are converted to HTML. Standard transformations
    included in GT4 provide an interface that displays overview information,
    with hyperlinks giving the ability to drill down and view more detailed information
    about each monitored resource. </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../index/">MDS-Index service documentation</a>.</p>
<h4>MDS-Trigger service </h4>
<p>The <em>MDS-Trigger</em> service performs user-specified actions (such as
  sending email or generating a log-file entry) whenever collected information
  matches criteria determined by the users. MDS-Trigger defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a Web service interface that allows a client to register an XPath query;
    and</li>
  <li>a program to be executed whenever a new value matches a user-supplied matching
    rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../trigger/">MDS-Trigger service documentation</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="basicframework"></a>Basic framework</h3>
<p>The key to understanding WS MDS is the aggregator service/information
  source framework. The basic process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Grid resources</em> are
        explicitly registered with an <em>aggregator service</em>.  </li>
  <li>The aggregator service periodically collects up-to-date state or status
        information from all registered Grid resources using specific <em>information
        sources</em>. </li>
  <li>The aggregator service then publishes this information to the user [makes
    this information available to the user].</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="registering"></a>Registering Grid resources </h4>
[In general, I think the next few pictures could do a better job of showing
how information about non-Grid-Service resources are monitored.  For example,
it's not necessarily true that an information source that monitors GridFTP
gets all its information from the GridFTP server -- it might look at log
files, do system calls to figure out how much disk space is available, etc.
You might even want to consider showing something that monitors something other
than a service (like an information source that monitors free disk space
by doing system calls, independent of GridFTP).  -- Laura]
<p>An aggregator service registers with a  Grid resource via
  a Web service (WS-ServiceGroup) Add operation. Registrations can be configured
  either at an MDS-Index service or at a Grid resource. </p>
<p>Registrations have a
    lifetime: if not renewed periodically, they expire. Thus, an aggregator service
    is self-cleaning: outdated entries disappear automatically when they do not
    renew their registrations.</p>
<p><img src="registering_grid_resources.jpg" width="861" height="428"></p>
<h4><a name="collecting"></a>Collecting the information </h4>
<p>The information source is the 'compatibility' link between the Grid resource
  and the aggregator service; its purpose is to ensure the information
  is formatted in a way the aggregator service understands (namely, well-formed
  XML). In the following diagram, RFT and WS GRAM, both WSRF services, simply
  pass their information using WSRF protocols to the appropriate Java class
  whereas GridFTP and RLS use an executable that &quot;talks&quot; to them and converts
  the information. From that point, all information is sent as XML to the MDS-Index
  service. </p>
<p><img src="collecting_info.jpg" width="1016" height="598"></p>
<h4><a name="publishing"></a>Publishing the information </h4>
<p>Aggregator services 
  publish the collected information for the user in many different formats. The
    following diagram show the user receiving information via WebMDS (in the
    form of a Web browser interface) and the Trigger service (in the form of
    an email triggered by conditions set by the user.)</p>
<p><img src="publishing_info.jpg" width="1020" height="737"></p>
<h3><a name="basicdeployment"></a>Basic WS MDS Deployment</h3>
<p>Every standard GT4 Web services hosting environment includes a default MDS-Index
  service. Any GT4 services running in that hosting environment (e.g.,
  GRAM, CAS, RFT) are automatically registered. Thus, each installation on a
  platform has an MDS-Index that allows you to discover what services are available.</p>
<p>Since virtual organizations (VOs) often need to keep track of all available
  Grid resources,  GT4
  also provides a simple method for registering one or more default indexes to
  be a VO-wide MDS-Index. In this setup,  each Grid resource registered
  to a default MDS-Index is also registered in the VO MDS-Index.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description of a basic deployment within a VO, see <a href="deployment_overview.html">Deploying
    WS MDS in a Virtual Organization</a>. </p>
<h2><a name=relateddocs></a>Performance Characteristics</h2>
<p>We only have very preliminary performance data at this time. These data suggest
  that WS MDS aggregator services can support query rates of the order of tens
  of queries per second (depending on data sizes) and a few hundred information
  sources, depending on registration and information update rates. We emphasize
  that these are not accurate data. We welcome feedback on application requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As stated above, in some cases WS MDS has lower performance
  than MDS2 (such as raw query rate) due to the immaturity of the underlying
  technologies, while in other cases it has higher performance than MDS2 due
  to architectural changes (such as removal of cascading queries.)</p>
