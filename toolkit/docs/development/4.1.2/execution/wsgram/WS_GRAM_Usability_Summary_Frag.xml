    <simpara>Fault Tolerance.  The ability for the GRAM service to recover after a container or host crash.  Recovery includes the continued processing and monitoring of all jobs managed by the GRAM service at the time of the crash.  The 4.0 GRAM architecture was simplified (from GT3) which is the main reason that fault tolerance has improved.</simpara>
