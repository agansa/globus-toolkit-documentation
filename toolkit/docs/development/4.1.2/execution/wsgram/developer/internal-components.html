<h1>Internal Components</h1>

<h2>Scheduler Event Generator</h2>
<p>The Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) is a program which uses
scheduler-specific monitoring modules to generate job state
change events. At the SEG level, the state change events correspond to
changes in any jobs which are managed by the scheduler, even if they do
not correspond to jobs initiated by the Managed Job Service. These state
change events are propagated to the Job State Monitor.</p>

<p>Depending on scheduler-specific requirements, the SEG may need to run with
priviledges to enable it to obtain scheduler event
notifications. As such, one SEG runs per scheduler resource. For example,
on a host which provides access to both PBS and fork jobs, two SEGs, running
at (potentially) different privilege levels will be running.</p>

<p>When executed, the SEG is able to start issuing events from some
time in the past. The SEG will, in general, not require any persistent
state between invocations. One SEG instance exists for any particular
scheduled resource instance (one for all homogeneous PBS queues, one for
all fork jobs, etc).</p>

<p>The SEG is implemented in an executable called the
globus-scheduler-event-generator, located in the Globus Toolkit's libexec
directory. It is invoked with the following command line:</p>

<pre>
    globus-scheduler-event-generator -s <SCHEDULER NAME> [-t <TIMESTAMP>]
</pre>

<h2>Fork Starter</h2>
<p>
The fork job starter's purpose is to provide a way to manage fork jobs such
that job state changes will be delivered in a timely way to the WS-GRAM
service. The fork job starter will be the parent of any number of processes
which were started in response to MJS job requests. As the parent, it will
receive the SIGCHLD signal when its child processes terminate, and use these to
propagate job state changes to the WS-GRAM service.</p>

<p>Communication between the fork job starter and the process which invokes it
is done through the standard input and output of the process. It communicates
job state changes through a log file which the fork Scheduler Event Generator
module parses.</p>
