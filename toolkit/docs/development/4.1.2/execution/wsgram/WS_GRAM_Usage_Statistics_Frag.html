<p>
The following usage statistics are sent by default in a UDP packet (in addition
to the GRAM component code, packet version, timestamp, and source IP address)
at the end of each job (i.e. when Done or Failed state is entered).
<ul>
    <li>job creation timestamp
        (helps determine the rate at which jobs are submitted)</li>
    <li>scheduler type
        (Fork, PBS, LSF, Condor, etc...)</li>
    <li>jobCredentialEndpoint present in RSL flag
        (to determine if server-side user proxies are being used)</li>
    <li>fileStageIn present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the staging in of files is used)</li>
    <li>fileStageOut present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the staging out of files is used)</li>
    <li>fileCleanUp present in RSL flag
        (to determine if the cleaning up of files is used)</li>
    <li>CleanUp-Hold requested flag
        (to determine if streaming is being used)</li>
    <li>job type
        (Single, Multiple, MPI, or Condor)</li>
    <li>gt2 error code if job failed
        (to determine common scheduler script errors users experience)</li>
    <li>fault class name if job failed
        (to determine general classes of common faults users experience)</li>
</ul>

We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve
the GRAM component.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable this feature, please
see the Java WS Core System Administrator's Guide section on
<a href="../../../common/javawscore/admin/#usageStatisticsTargets">Usage
Statistics Configuration</a> for instructions.<bn>

Also, please see our <a href="../../../Usage_Stats.html">policy statement</a>
on the collection of usage statistics.
