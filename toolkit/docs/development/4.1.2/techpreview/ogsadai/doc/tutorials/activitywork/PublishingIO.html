<h1>How Activities Publish Inputs and Outputs</h1>
<p>
An activity is required to have published the names of its inputs and
outputs (defined in Perform documents) before
returning from its constructor, using the mechanisms described
shortly. This is necessary so that the engine
can access this information and link activities together. The engine
will access these names via each activity's <span
class="java">getInputs()</span> and <span
class="java">getOutputs()</span> methods.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate publishing the names of an activity's inputs and outputs 
two <span class="java">String</span> arrays, <span
class="java">mInputs</span> and <span class="java">mOutputs</span>, 
are defined in the <span class="java">Activity</span> base
class. These arrays are returned by the <span
class="java">getInputs()</span> and <span
class="java">getOutputs()</span> methods respectively. Each of these  
arrays is set to a <span class="java">String</span> array of zero
length when the activity is created. This means that if an activity
does not have any inputs it needs do nothing to publicise the
fact. Therefore to publish the inputs and outputs of an activity all
that is necessary is to set <span class="java">mInputs</span>
and <span class="java">mOutputs</span> to arrays containing the
names, e.g. <span class="java">mInputs = new String[]
{input};</span>.
</p>
<p>
It is possible for the engine to determine the inputs and outputs for 
an activity without the names being published. This is achieved by
validating incoming Perform documents using
the Xerces PSVI parser. The code to do this is present (in <span
class="java">SchemaMap.validate(InputSource)</span> and in <span
class="java">Activity.getInputs/getOutputs</span>) but 
commented out. This was done because it was thought that it would be
more useful to disable validation of incoming Perform documents for
performance reasons than to extract inputs/outputs without developer
assistance. The two are mutually exclusive because once activities are
written without explicitly publishing their inputs and outputs then
validation cannot be disabled. 
</p>

<h2 id="NonOutputActivities">Non-Output Activities</h2>
<p>
If an activity does not publish any outputs it is given special
treatment by the engine. The handler that is used to manage its
execution is the <span
class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.RunAheadHandler</span>
(see <a href="#RunAheadHandler">below</a>) rather than the standard <span
class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.SimpleHandler</span>
that is assigned to all other activities.  
</p>
 
<h2 id="RunAheadHandler"><span class="java">RunAheadHandler</span></h2>
<p>
The <span class="java">RunAheadHandler</span> is a threaded handler
that continually loops, calling the <span
class="java">processBlock</span> method of its activity, until the
activity's status changes to either <span
class="java">COMPLETE</span>, or <span class="java">ERROR</span>. The
output pipes constructed for the activity's outputs are instances of
<span class="java">SynchronizedPipe</span>. A <span
class="java">SynchronizedPipe</span> is created with a buffer size,
N. If no objects are being extracted from the pipe by a consumer, then 
the producer activity can run ahead by N blocks before being forced to
wait for the consumer. If the consumer extracts a single block then
the producer can then produce N more blocks before being made to wait,
it will have to wait until the number of blocks buffered falls back to 
N. This means there can be up to N - 1 blocks present in the pipe at
any one time.
