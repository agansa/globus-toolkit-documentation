<para>The Workspace Management Service allows a Grid client to dynamically create and manage a workspace, currently implemented as a Unix account, 
on a remote site. The infrastructure is composed of a factory service that allows an authorized Grid client to create individual accounts or groups of accounts, 
and an account service that allows an authorized Grid client to manage individual account properties, such as account access policy or time to live (TTL). These 
    concepts are represented as <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/">WSRF</ulink> services and implemented using the GT4 implementation of WSRF.</para> 

<para>The workspace service code consists of a front-end implementing protocols for the creation and management of workspaces and a back-end implementation. 
Workspace creation and management can be implemented in different ways according to site policies and preferences. At this point, our implementation supports 
three such of such "back-ends": (1) true dynamic creation using the Unix "adduser" command, and (2) account pooling implementations, one based on Andrew McNab's 
gridmapdir patch and (3) and extension of pooling implementation using the gLite LCMAPS system.</para>
