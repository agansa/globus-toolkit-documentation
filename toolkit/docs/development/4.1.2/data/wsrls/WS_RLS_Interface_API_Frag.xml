    <para>The WS RLS is a WS-RF compliant service implemented using the Globus Java WS Core. It exposes a set of Resource Properties and operations to allow users to create, add and remove mappings from logical names to target names, to define and undefine attribute definitions associated with names, and to create, modify and delete attributes associated with names. A custom query expression dialect is defined by the WS RLS which may be used to query the mapping and attributes represented by the Resource Properties of the service.</para>
