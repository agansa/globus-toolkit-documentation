   use this file with xmllint to validate this component's xml:
   a) make sure the "entities" file in the root directory is up to date
   b) run xmllint in this directory (need to find a way to describe command without double hyphens)
   
   if you have no errors, there will be no output.
   if you have errors, xmllint will output with lots of information to help you figure out what went wrong.
   to research elements, go to: http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/part2.html
   
   note: xmllint is part of xsltproc so you will need to have that in your machine
