<h1>Interacting with Data Resources</h1>
<p>
OGSA-DAI supports interaction with data resources, and other data
manipulation operations, via a document-oriented interface:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="Activities.html">Activities</a> - are the data resource
manipulation, data transformation and delivery actions that a client
wants an OGSA-DAI service to perform. Activities are the basic
building block of Perform documents.
</li>
<li>
<a href="Perform.html">Perform Documents</a> - are used by clients to
specify to OGSA-DAI services the data resource query and update, data
transformation and data delivery activities they want executed.
</li>
<li>
<a href="Response.html">Response Documents</a> - are used by OGSA-DAI
services to inform clients as to the status of execution of their
Perform documents and, often, to also return data to a client.
</li>
</ul>
