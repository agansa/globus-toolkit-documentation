<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) is a WSRF based service that
provides interfaces for controlling and monitoring third party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfers
(in this case RFT )&nbsp; is hosted inside of a Grid service so it can
be managed using the soft state model. It is essentially a reliable and
recoverable version of the GT2 <code>globus-url-copy</code> tool and
more. In 3.9.3 RFT can also perform file deletion, recursive directory
deletion operations. It is also used by GRAM to perform all the staging
operations and cleanup operations.<br>
