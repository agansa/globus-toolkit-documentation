<para>RFT Service implementation
in 3.9.5 uses
standard SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd
party GridFTP transfers and to delete files using GridFTP. The user
creates a RFT resource by submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files
that need to be transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The
user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user is
creating to a GT 3.9.5 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and
authenticated. RFT service implementation exposes operations to control
and manage the transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both
RFT factory and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource
the user created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource
property to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for
the changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.</para>

<section><title>RFT Factory Service </title>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><simpara><computeroutput>ActiveResourceInstances</computeroutput>: A dynamic resource property of total
number of active rft resources in the container at a given point of
time.

  <listitem><simpara><computeroutput>TotalNumberOfTransfers</computeroutput>: A dynamic resource property of total
number of transfers/deletes performed since the RFT service is deployed

number of active transfers across all rft resources in a container at a
given point of time.
  </simpara></listitem>

the deployment of the service.

<section><title>RFT Service </title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>OverallStatus</computeroutput>: This is a complex type providing overall status of a RFT resource by providing number of transfers pending, active, finished, retrying, failed, cancelled. Each of those values can be obtained by invoking getTransfers(Finished/Active/Failed/Restarted/Pending/Cancelled) on OverallStatus Resource Property.Note that this Resource Property gets updated every time one of the transfers changes state, so there can be and will be more than one update, in the life time of a RFT resource, if you subscribe to this RP. This Resource Property also includes the last fault (if thrown) from a transfer and can be accessed by invoking getFault on OverallStatus. This will indicate why a transfer has failed.</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>RequestStatus</computeroutput>: This is complex type resource property providing status of a RFT resource in form of Pending/Active/Done/Failed. The status can be obtained from RequestStatusType by invoking getRequestStatus(). This will result in one of four status strings(Pending/Active/Done/Failed/Cancelled). This RP also contains a fault that denotes the last fault in a RFT resource and can be accessed by invoking getFault(). If a client is subscribed to this RP there will be only be 2 updates in the life time of a rft resource (Pending->Active->Done, Pending->Active->Failed, Pending->Active->Cancelled, Pending->Cancelled).</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>TotalBytes</computeroutput>: provides the total number of bytes transferred by the resource</simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara><computeroutput>TotalTime</computeroutput>: provides the total time taken to transfer the above mentioned total bytes.  </simpara></listitem>
