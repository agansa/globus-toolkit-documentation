<title> RFT Fault-Tolerance and Recovery </title>
<section id="s-rft-recovery-introduction">
<para> RFT uses PostgreSQL to check-point transfer state in the form of restart markers and recover from transient transfer failures, 
    using retry mechanism with exponential backoff, during a transfer. RFT has been tested to recover from source and/or destination 
    server crashes during a transfer, network failures, container failures ( when the machine running the container goes down ), file 
    system failures, etc. RFT Resource is implemented as a PersistentResource, so ReliableFileTransferHome gets initialized every 
    time a container gets restarted. Please find more detailed description of fault-tolerance and recovery in RFT below:
<itemizedlist>

    <listitem>Source and/or destination GridFTP failures: In this case RFT retries the transfer for a configurable number of maximum attempts with 
    exponential backoff for each retry (the backoff time period is configurable, also). If a failure happens in the midst of a transfer, RFT uses 
    the last restart marker that is stored in the database for that transfer and uses it to resume the transfer from the point where it failed instead 
    of restarting the whole file again. This failure is treated as a container-wide backoff for the server in question. What that means is that all 
    other transfers going to/from that server, across all the requests in a container, will be backed off and retried. This is done in order to prevent 
    further failures of the transfers by using knowledge available in the database.</listitem>

    <listitem>Network failures: Sometimes this happens due to heavy load on a network or for any other reason packets are lost or connections get timed out. This failure 
    is considered a transient failure and RFT retries the transfer with exponential backoff for that particular transfer (and not the whole container 
    as with the source and/or destination GridFTP failures).</listitem>

    <listitem>Container failures: These type of failures occur when the machine running the container goes down or if the container is restarted with active 
    transfers. When the container is restarted, it restarts ReliableTransferHome which looks at the database for any active RFT resources and restarts them.</listitem>
