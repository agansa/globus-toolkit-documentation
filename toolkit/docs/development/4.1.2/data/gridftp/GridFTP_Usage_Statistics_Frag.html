<p>
The following GridFTP-specific usage statistics are sent in a UDP packet at 
the end of each transfer, in addition to the standard header information 
described in the  <a href="../../../Usage_Stats.html">Usage Stats</a> section.
<ul>
    <li> Start time of the transfer </li>
    <li> End time of the transfer </li>
    <li> Version string of the server </li>
    <li> TCP buffer size used for the transfer </li>
    <li> Block size used for the transfer </li>
    <li> Total number of bytes transferred </li>
    <li> Number of parallel streams used for the transfer </li>
    <li> Number of stripes used for the transfer </li>
    <li> Type of transfer (STOR, RETR, LIST) </li>
    <li> FTP response code -- Success or failure of the transfer </li>
<ul>
</p>
<p> 
We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive 
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve 
and guage the usage of the GridFTP server.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable 
this feature for GridFTP only, see the Logging section of the 
<a href="../GridFTP_Public_Interfaces.html#config">GridFTP 
configuration and command line options</a>.  Note that you can disable transmission
of usage statistics globally for all C components by setting 
"GLOBUS_USAGE_OPTOUT=1" in your environment.

Also, please see our <a href="../../../Usage_Stats.html">policy statement </a> on the collection of usage statistics.
