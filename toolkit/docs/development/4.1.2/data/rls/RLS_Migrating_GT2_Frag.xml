<para>Users of GT2 RLS must create the RLI database, which was not required in some GT2 versions 
of RLS. To create the RLI database run the RLI database script for your particular DBMS. See the
<ulink url="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/data/rls/admin/RLS_Build_Install.html#rlsdbconfig">database configuration instructions</ulink> for more details. This is only required if the RLS
is deployed as an RLI (e.g., <command>rls_server <replaceable>true</replaceable></command>).</para>
