    <listitem><simpara><emphasis>Dedicated User Account:</emphasis> It is recommended that users create a dedicated user account for installing and running the RLS service (e.g., <computeroutput>globus</computeroutput> as recommended in the general GT installation instructions). This account may be used to install and run other services from the Globus Toolkit.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara><emphasis>Key and Certificate:</emphasis> It is recommended that users do not use their hostkey and hostcert for use by the RLS service. Create a containerkey and containercert with permissions <computeroutput>400</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>644</computeroutput> respectively and owned by the <computeroutput>globus</computeroutput> user. Change the <computeroutput>rlskeyfile</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>rlscertfile</computeroutput> settings in the RLS configureation file (<filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</filename>) to reflect the appropriate filenames.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara><emphasis>LRC and RLI Databases:</emphasis> Users must ensure security of the RLS data as maintained by their chosen database management system. Appropriate precautions should be made to protect the data and access to the database. Such precautions may include creating a user account specifically for RLS usage, encrypting database users' passwords, etc.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara><emphasis>RLS Configuration:</emphasis> It is recommended that the RLS configuration file (<filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-rls-server.conf</filename>) be owned by and accessible only by the dedicated user account for RLS (e.g., <computeroutput>globus</computeroutput> account per above recommendations). The file contains the database user account and password used to access the LRC and RLI databases along with important settings which, if tampered with, could adversely affect the RLS service.</simpara></listitem>
