<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>
Globus XIO is based on an event based asynchronous programming model.
This model is described in great detail at:

  <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/developer/globus-async.html">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/developer/globus-async.html</a>.
  In short, with Globus XIO, connections are opened and closed. While open, read
  and write requests are posted with a callback function pointer  given by the
user.  When the event completes, the given callback is called.</p>
