<section id="cwscore-cft-whatistesting"><title>What is a &quot;Call for Community Testing&quot;? </title>
<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that new Globus
  code is available for testing in the field. Through these calls, the Globus
  Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety of usage scenarios early
  in its development process. The ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have
  historically been found only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from
  the community on ways our software can be improved. </para>

  We need volunteers to exercise C WS Core to discover performance and scalability
    problems. Since C WS Core is a critical piece to any service built on top
    of it, its performance and scalability directly affects the service. Therefore,
    improving the C WS Core performance most likely will improve the service
    performance.

  We need volunteers for C WS Core to discover functionality and usability problems.
    Improving usability and functionality will make the software easier to use
    and develop.
