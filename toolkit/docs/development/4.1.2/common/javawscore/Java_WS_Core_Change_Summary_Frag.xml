<para>The following changes have occurred for Java WS Core since the last stable release, &previousversion;:</para>

  <section>
    <title>New command line tools</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
       The <computeroutput>globus-validate-descriptors</computeroutput> command line tool is used to validate the Web Services Deployment Descriptor (<computeroutput>.wsdd</computeroutput>) files, JNDI configuration files (<computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput>), and security descriptors for all services.
      </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>
       The <computeroutput>globus-check-environment</computeroutput> command line tool is used to display component version information and to validate JVM version.
      </simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section>
    <title>New common command line options</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
        <computeroutput>-t, --timeout</computeroutput> option is used to configure the client-side timeout value.
      </simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section>
    <title><computeroutput>globus-start-container</computeroutput> changes</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
       A new <computeroutput>-i</computeroutput> command line option was added to force the container to bind to the specified network address.
      </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>
       <computeroutput>globus-start-container</computeroutput> now performs a JVM version check to ensure that at least Java 1.4 JVM is used to start the container.
      </simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section>
    <title>GAR deployment/undeployment changes</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
       <computeroutput>globus-deploy-gar</computeroutput> will NOT overwrite the existing GAR deployment by default now. The existing deployment must be undeployed first or the GAR must be deployed with <computeroutput>-overwrite</computeroutput> option.
      </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>  
        During GAR deployment the service configuration files such as <computeroutput>.wsdd</computeroutput> files, <computeroutput>jndi-config.xml</computeroutput> file, and security deployment descriptors will now be automatically validated.
      </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>
       Client-side type mapping will now be properly removed during GAR undeployment.
      </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>
       Both GAR deployment and undeployment operations now explicitly check if the container is currently running. If so, the operation is aborted. The container must be off before deploying or undeploying GAR files.
      </simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section>
    <title>Simpler local invocation</title>
    <para> 
      It is now easier to make local invocations. Axis' <computeroutput>MessageContext</computeroutput> does not need to be associated with the current thread anymore and the stub does not need to be configured in any way to make local invocations.
    </para>
 </section>

 <section>
    <title>New API</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
       A new <computeroutput>MessageContextHelper</computeroutput> helper API were added to help in associating an arbitrary <computeroutput>MessageContext</computeroutput> object with the current thread of execution.
      </simpara></listitem>
