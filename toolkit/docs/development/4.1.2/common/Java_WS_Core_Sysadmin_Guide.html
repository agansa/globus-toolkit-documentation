<h1>Java WS Core System Administrator's Guide</h1>

<h2>Configuring services</h2>
<p>We now support per service (per gar really) configuration. No changes are
necessary in the way you create or deploy a gar file. 
The configuration files will now be stored under $G_L/etc/<gar name>/ for
each gar. Under there you will find your (client-)server-config.wsdd and/or
jndi-config.xml for your service(s) from your gar file (they are copied now,
untouched, so xml comments will be preserved). The container on start up
will scan all immediate directories under $G_L/etc/ and load all
server-config.wsdd/jndi-config.xml files it finds. Btw, client-config.wsdd
is merged into one file as before.</p>

<p>Also, we now support configuration profiles. You can start our container
with '-profile <profile_name>' option and that will tell the container to
load configuration files that start with '<profile_name>-'. For example,
java org.globus.wsrf.container.ServiceContainer -profile foo  will force
container to look for and load foo-server-config.wsdd,
foo-client-server-config.wsdd, foo-jndi-config.xml from the different gar
directories in etc/.</p>

<p>Gar deployment into a specific profile is coming. These changes do not
affect the security descriptor file in any way at this point.</p>
