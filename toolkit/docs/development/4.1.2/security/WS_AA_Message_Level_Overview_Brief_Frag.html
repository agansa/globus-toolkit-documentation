The Web Services portions of GT4 use SOAP as their message protocol
for communication. GSI implements the WS-Security standard and the
WS-SecureConversation specification to provide message protection for
SOAP messages. Protection options include authentication of the
sender, encryption of the message, integrity protection of the
message and replay protection.
