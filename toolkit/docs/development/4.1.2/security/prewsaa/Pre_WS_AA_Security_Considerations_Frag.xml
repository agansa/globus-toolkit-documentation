In host authorization, the toolkit treats DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot; as equivalent to &quot;hostname.edu&quot;. This means that if a service was setup to do host authorization and hence accept the certificate &quot;hostname.edu&quot;, it would also accept certificates with DNs &quot;hostname-*.edu&quot;. A <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2969">bug</ulink> has been opened to see if this feature needs to be modfiied.
