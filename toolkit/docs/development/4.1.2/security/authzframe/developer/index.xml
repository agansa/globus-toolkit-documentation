<para> The authorization framework enforces a configured authorization
policy on the service and client side.  The framework allows for
developers to configure a chain of authorization mechanism either
programatically or declaratively using security descriptors. It also
allows for plugging in new authorization scheme (in addition to using
those that are provided with the framework.) Moreover the framework
allows for this configuration to be done at resource, service or
container level, each taking precedence in the order specified and
scoped as the name suggestes.</para>

<section id="s-authzframe-developer-scenarios"><title>Usage scenarios</title>

<para> Configuring authorization information can be done using
programmatic interface and is described in detail in these two
sections of <ulink url="./../security_descriptor.html">Security Descriptor</ulink>
document: a) <ulink url="./../security_descriptor.html#descProgram">
Programmatic altering of descriptors</ulink> and b) <ulink
url="./../security_descriptor.html#resDesc">Resource Security
Descriptor</ulink>.</para>

<para> If the authorization framework is set on either service or
container level and is using one of the schemes that are distributed
with the toolkit, it is recommended that declarative configuration
using security descriptor files be used.</para>
