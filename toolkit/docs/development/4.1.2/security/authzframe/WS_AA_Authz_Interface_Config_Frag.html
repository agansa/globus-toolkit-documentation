<h3>Configuration overview</h3>

<p> The authorization framework can be configured at resource, service
or container level using security descriptors. The descriptors can be
read off a file or can be created programatically. The configuration
involves setting a chain of authorization schemes (also known as
Policy Decision Point (PDP)), that are then evaluated to a permit/deny
decision.</p>
