<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The MyProxy service allows your users to retrieve proxy credentials
for Globus Toolkit authentication with a username and passphrase.
A typical MyProxy configuration has one dedicated myproxy-server for
the site, with MyProxy clients installed on all systems where other
Globus Toolkit client software is installed.
</p>
<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>
<p>
To install MyProxy, follow the instructions for the Globus
Toolkit <em>All Services</em> or <em>Pre-WS</em> Installer.
</p>
<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring </h2>
<p>Information on configuration settings and environment variables can be found
  in the <a href="../Cred_Mgmt_MyProxy_Public_Interfaces.html">public interface
  guide</a>.</p>

<p>
No additional configuration is required to use MyProxy clients after
they are installed, though you may want to set the MYPROXY_SERVER
environment variable to the hostname of your myproxy-server in the
default user environment on your systems.
Information for configuring the myproxy-server follows.
</p>

<h3>Configuring a MyProxy Server Installation</h3>

<p>
You should choose a well-protected host to run the myproxy-server
on. Consult with security-aware personnel at your site. You want a host
that is secured to the level of a Kerberos KDC, that has limited user
access, runs limited services, and is well monitored and maintained in
terms of security patches.
</p>

<p>
For a typical myproxy-server installation, 
the host on which the myproxy-server is running must
have /etc/grid-security created and a host certificate installed.
In this case, the myproxy-server will run as root so it can access the
host certificate and key.
</p>

<p>
Next,
modify $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/myproxy-server.config
to configure the MyProxy server.
<strong>If you skip this step, your myproxy-server will not accept
any requests.</strong>
The default configuration does not enable any
myproxy-server features to provide the greatest security until you
have configured your server.
To enable all myproxy-server features, uncomment to provided sample
policy at the top of the myproxy-server.config config file, as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p><kbd>
#<br>
# Complete Sample Policy<br>
#<br>
# The following lines define a sample policy that enables all<br>
# myproxy-server features.  See below for more examples.<br>
accepted_credentials  "*"<br>
authorized_retrievers "*"<br>
default_retrievers    "*"<br>
authorized_renewers   "*"<br>
default_renewers      "none"<br>
</kbd></p></blockquote>
<p>
If you have root access, you can copy your
myproxy-server.config file to /etc/myproxy-server.config
so it is not overwritten by later installations.
</p>

<h2><a name="deploying"></a>Deploying</h2>

<p>
A sample SysV-style
boot script for MyProxy is installed at
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.init.d.myproxy.
To install on Linux, copy the file to /etc/rc.d/init.d/myproxy and run
'chkconfig --add myproxy'.
You will need to edit the file to set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment
variable correctly.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, to run the myproxy server out of inetd or xinetd, you
need to do the following as root:
</p>
<ul>
<li>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.services.modifications to the
       /etc/services or /etc/inet/services file.
 
<li>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.inetd.conf.modifications to
       /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/inet/inetd.conf, or copy
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.xinetd.myproxy to
       /etc/xinetd.d/myproxy.  You'll need to modify the paths in the
       file according to your installation.

<li>   Reactivate the inetd (or xinetd).
       This is typically accomplished by sending the SIGHUP signal to
       the daemon.  Refer to the inetd or xinetd man page for your system.
</ul>

<h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>

<p>
To verify your myproxy-server installation and configuration, you can
run the myproxy-server directly from your shell.
If using a host certificate, you will need to run the myproxy-server
as root.
First, make sure your Globus environment is setup in your shell.
Set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the location of your
MyProxy installation.  
Then, depending on your shell, run one of the following commands.
</p>
<p>
For csh shells:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<kbd>source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh</kbd>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For sh shells:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<kbd>. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh</kbd>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then, run <kbd>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/myproxy-server -d</kbd>.
The <kbd>-d</kbd> argument runs the myproxy-server in debug mode.
It will write debugging messages to the terminal and
exit after servicing a single request.
You'll need to start it once for each test request.
In another shell, you can run the MyProxy client programs to test the
server.
</p>

<p>
If run without the <kbd>-d</kbd> argument,
the myproxy-server program will start up and background itself.
It accepts connections on TCP port 7512, forking off a separate child
to handle each incoming connection.
It logs information via the syslog service under the daemon facility.
