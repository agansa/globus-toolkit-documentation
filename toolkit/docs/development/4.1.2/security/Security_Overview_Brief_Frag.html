<p>Security tools are concerned with establishing the identity of users or services
  (authentication), protecting communications, and determining who is allowed
  to perform what actions (authorization), as well as with supporting functions
  such as managing user credentials and maintaining group membership information.</p>
<p>GT4 provides distinct WS and pre-WS authentication and authorization capabilities.
  Both build on the same base, namely standard X.509 end entity certificates
  and proxy certificates, which are used to identify persistent entities such
  as users and servers and to support the temporary delegation of privileges
  to other entities, respectively.</p>
<p>GT4&rsquo;s WS security [76] comprises (a) <em>Message-Level Security</em> mechanisms,
  which implement the WS-Security standard and the WS-SecureConversation specification
  to provide message protection for GT4&rsquo;s SOAP messages, (b) <em>Transport-Level
  Security</em> mechanisms, which uses transport-level security (TLS) mechanisms;
  and (c) an <em>Authorization Framework</em> that allows for a variety of authorization
  schemes, including a &ldquo; grid-mapfile&rdquo; access control list , an access
  control list defined by a service, a custom authorization handler, and access
  to an authorization service via the SAML protocol. For non-WS components, GT4
  provides similar authentication, delegation, and authorization mechanisms,
  although with fewer authorization options.</p>
