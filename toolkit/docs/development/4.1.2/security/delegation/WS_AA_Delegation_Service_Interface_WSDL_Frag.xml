<section><title>Protocol overview</title>

<para> The delegation service allows for delegation of credentials and is
based on <ulink
url="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-trust/">WS-Trust</ulink>
specification. A WSDL interface to refresh the credentials remotely is
also provided. Access to these credentials is restricted to co-hosted
services, i.e services that are run in the same container and is done
using shared Java state. Other co-hosted services interested in the
credentials can register listeners and will be notified on credential
refresh.</para>
