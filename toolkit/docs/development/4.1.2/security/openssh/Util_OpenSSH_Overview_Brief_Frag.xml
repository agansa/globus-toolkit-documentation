GSI-OpenSSH is a modified version of OpenSSH that adds support for
    X.509 <glossterm linkend="proxy-cert">proxy certificate</glossterm> authentication and delegation,
providing a single sign-on remote login and file transfer service.
GSI-OpenSSH can be used to login to remote systems and
transfer files between systems without entering a password, relying
    instead on a valid <glossterm linkend="proxy-cred">proxy credential</glossterm> for authentication.
GSI-OpenSSH forwards proxy credentials to the remote system on login,
so commands requiring proxy credentials
(including GSI-OpenSSH commands)
can be used on the remote system without the need to manually create a
new proxy credential on that system.
