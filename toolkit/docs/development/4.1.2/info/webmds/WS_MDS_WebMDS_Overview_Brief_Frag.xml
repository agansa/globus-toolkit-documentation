WebMDS enables end users to view monitoring information via a standard
web browser interface, without installing any additional software on their
PC.  WebMDS is implemented as a servlet that uses a plugin interface to
gather monitoring information (or any other information in XML format) and
XSLT transforms, and present the data to the user in a readable form.
Web site administrators can customize their own WebMDS deployments by using
HTML form options, configuring different plugins to collect data and XSLT
transforms, and creating their own plugins and XSLT transforms.
