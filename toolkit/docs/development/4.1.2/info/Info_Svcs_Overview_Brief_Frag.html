<p>Monitoring and discovery mechanisms are concerned with obtaining, distributing,
  indexing, archiving, and otherwise processing information about the configuration
  and state of services and resources. In some cases, the motivation for collecting
  this information is to enable discovery of services or resources; in other
  cases, it is to enable monitoring of system status.</p>
GT4&rsquo;s support in its Java, C, and Python WS Core for WSRF and WS-Notification
interfaces provides useful building blocks for monitoring and discovery, enabling
the definition of properties for which monitoring and discovery is be provided,
and subsequent pull- and push-mode access. GT4 services such as GRAM and RFT
define appropriate resource properties, providing a basis for service discovery
and monitoring. Other GT4 services are designed to enable discovery and monitoring,
providing for indexing (MDS-Index) and analysis of
data for significant events (MDS-Trigger). Every GT4 container incorporates a
built-in MDS-Index service for discovery of services within the container; these
MDS-Index services can be linked to build Grid-wide indices.
