<p>There is no GUI specifically for the Index Service. The release contains
   a tech preview of <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/info/webmds/index.html">WebMDS</a>
   which can be used to display monitoring information collected in 
   an Index Service in a normal web browser.
