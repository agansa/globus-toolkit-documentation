	<title>Installing SimpleCA</title>

	<para>The following are instructions for how to use SimpleCA to set up certificates
		for a GT 4.0 installation. </para>
	<para>SimpleCA provides a wrapper around the OpenSSL CA functionality and is sufficient
		for simple Grid services. Alternatively, you can use OpenSSL's <command>CA.sh</command> command
		on its own. SimpleCA is suitable for testing or when a certificate authority
		(CA) is not available. You can find other CA options 
		<link linkend="s-basic-host">here</link>. </para>

	<section id="simpleca-users"><title>Create users </title>
		<para>Make sure you have the following users on your machine:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>Your <emphasis>user</emphasis> account, which will be used to run the client programs.
			</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>A generic <emphasis>globus</emphasis> account, which will be used 
					to perform administrative
				tasks such as starting and stopping the container, deploying services, etc.
				This user will also be in charge of managing the SimpleCA. To do this, make
				sure this account has read and write permissions in the 
				<filename class="directory">$<envar>GLOBUS_LOCATION</envar></filename> directory.

	<section id="simpleca-setup"><title>Run the setup script</title>
		<para>A script was installed to set up a new SimpleCA. You only need to run this
			script <emphasis>once</emphasis> per Grid. </para>
		<para>Run the setup script:</para>
		<screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-simple-ca 
		</screen>
		<section id="simpleca-subjectname"><title>2.1 Configure the subject name</title>
			<para>This script prompts you for information about the CA you wish to create:</para>
			<screen>
The unique subject name for this CA is:
cn=Globus Simple CA, ou=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov, ou=GlobusTest, o=Grid

Do you want to keep this as the CA subject (y/n) [y]:</screen>
			<para>where:</para>
			<table>
				<title>CA Name components</title>
				<tgroup cols="2">
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>cn</entry>
							<entry>Represents "common name".  Identifies this particular
								certificate as the CA certificate within the 
								"GloubusTest/simpleCA-hostname" domain,
								which in this case is Globus Simple CA.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>ou</entry>
							<entry>Represents "organizational unit".  Identifies this CA from other
								CAs created by SimpleCA by other people. The second "ou" is
								specific to your hostname (in this cases GlobusTest).</entry>

		<section id="simpleca-email"><title>Configure the CA's email</title>
			<para>The next prompt looks like:</para>
			<screen>
Enter the email of the CA (this is the email where certificate
requests will be sent to be signed by the CA):</screen>
			<para>Enter the email address where you intend to receive certificate requests.
				It should be your real email address that you check, not the address of the
				globus user.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="simpleca-expiration"><title>Configure the expiration date </title>
			<para>Then you'll see: </para>
			<screen>
The CA certificate has an expiration date. Keep in mind that 
once the CA certificate has expired, all the certificates 
signed by that CA become invalid.  A CA should regenerate 
the CA certificate and start re-issuing ca-setup packages 
before the actual CA certificate expires.  This can be done 
by re-running this setup script.  Enter the number of DAYS 
the CA certificate should last before it expires.
[default: 5 years (1825 days)]:</screen>
			<para>This is the number of days for which the CA certificate is valid. Once this
				time expires, the CA certificate will have to be recreated, and all of its
				certificates regranted. </para>
			<para>Accept the default (recommended). </para>
		</section>
		<section id="simpleca-passphrase"><title>Enter a passphrase</title>
			<para>Next you'll see: </para>

writing new private key to '/home/globus/.globus/simpleCA//private/cakey.pem'
Enter PEM pass phrase:</screen>
			<para>The passphrase of the CA certificate will be used only when signing certificates
				(with <command>grid-cert-sign</command>). It should be hard to guess, as its compromise
				may compromise all the certificates signed by the CA.</para>
			<para>Enter your passphrase. </para>
			<note><simpara><emphasis>Important:</emphasis> Your passphrase must <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain
					any spaces. </simpara></note>
		</section>
		<section id="simpleca-confirmcert"><title>Confirm generated certificate</title>
			<para>Finally you'll see the following: </para>
			<screen>
A self-signed certificate has been generated 
for the Certificate Authority with the subject: 

/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-mayed.mcs.anl.gov/CN=Globus Simple CA

If this is invalid, rerun this script 

setup/globus/setup-simple-ca

and enter the appropriate fields.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The private key of the CA is stored in /home/globus/.globus/simpleCA//private/cak ey.pem
The public CA certificate is stored in /home/globus/.globus/simpleCA//cacert.pem

The distribution package built for this CA is stored in

/home/globus/.globus/simpleCA//globus_simple_ca_68ea3306_setup-0.17.tar.gz</screen>
			<para>This information will be important for setting up other machines in your grid.
				The number <replaceable>68ea3306</replaceable> in the last line is known as your 
				<emphasis>CA hash</emphasis>.
				It will be an 8 hexadecimal digit string. </para>

***************************************************************************

Note: To complete setup of the GSI software you need to run the
following script as root to configure your security configuration
directory:

/opt/gt4/setup/globus_simple_ca_68ea3306_setup/setup-gsi

For further information on using the setup-gsi script, use the -help
option.  The -default option sets this security configuration to be 
the default, and -nonroot can be used on systems where root access is 
not available.

		<title>Configure SimpleCA for multiple machines </title>
		<para>So far , you have a single machine configured with SimpleCA

				Complete setup of  GSI</link> a
			CA setup package was created in <filename>.globus/simpleCA/globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz</filename>.

		<para>To install it, copy that package to the second machine and run:
			<screen> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz gcc32dbg</screen>
