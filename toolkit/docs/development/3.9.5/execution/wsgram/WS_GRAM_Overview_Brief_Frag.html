Web Services Grid Resource Allocation and Management (WS GRAM) component comprises
  a set of WSRF-compliant Web services to locate, submit, monitor, and cancel
  jobs on Grid computing resources. WS GRAM is not a job scheduler, but rather
  a set of services and clients for communicating with a range of different local
  job schedulers using a common protocol. WS GRAM is meant to address a range
  of jobs where reliable operation, stateful monitoring, credential management,
  and file staging are important.
