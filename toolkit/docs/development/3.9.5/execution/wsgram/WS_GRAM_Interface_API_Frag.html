<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>This component consists abstractly of two interfaces: the managed job factory
port type(MJFPT) and the manaaged job port type (MJPT).</p>

<p>In actuality there are three service/resource implementations, two of which
implement the basic MJPT. The first one is the service which actually talks to
a particular local resource manager to execute a process on the remote computer
or cluster.  This one is called a managed executable job service (MEJS) and it's
resource is called the managed executable job resource (MEJR). The second is a
special implementation which accepts a multi-job description, breaks the
description up into single-job descriptions, and then submits each of these
so-called "sub-jobs" to an MEJS.  This implementation is called the managed
multi-job service (MMJS). It's resource is called the managed multi-job resource
(MMJR)</p>

<p>Because of the fact that these two job services use the same port type, the
API for accessing both the MEJR and the MMJR are identical. The MJFS creates the
appropriate job resource depending on the factory resource used to qualify the
operation call.  Most of the factory resources represent local resource
managers used by the MEJS (Pbs, LSF, Condor).  There is a special Multi
factory resource which represents an abstract multi-job resource manager. The
appropriate job description type is required for the two different types of
managed job.</p>
