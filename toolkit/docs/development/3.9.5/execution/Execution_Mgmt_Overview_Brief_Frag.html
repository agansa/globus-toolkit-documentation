<p>Execution management tools are concerned with the initiation, monitoring, management,
  scheduling, and/or coordination of remote computations. GT4 supports the Grid
  Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM) interface as a basic mechanism for
  these purposes. The GT4 GRAM server is typically deployed in conjunction with
  Delegation and RFT servers to address data staging, delegation of proxy credentials,
  and computation monitoring and management in an integrated manner.</p>
