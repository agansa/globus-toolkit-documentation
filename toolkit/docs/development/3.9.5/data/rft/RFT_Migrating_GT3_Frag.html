<p>The RFT implementation in GT4 and GT3 are not interoperable as they are built
  on different GT core implementations. In order to migrate to GT4 RFT, you
  should follow the installation instructions of GT4 RFT which can be found <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/admin/docbook/">here</a>.</p>
