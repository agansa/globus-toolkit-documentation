<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>RFT Service implementation
in 3.9.4 uses
standard SOAP messages over HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd
party GridFTP transfers and to delete files using GridFTP. The user
creates a RFT resource by submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files
that need to be transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The
user also specifies the time to live for the resource the user is
creating to a GT 3.9.4 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured.
The resource is created after the user is properly authorized and
authenticated. RFT service implementation exposes operations to control
and manage the transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both
RFT factory and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource
the user created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource
property to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for
the changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always have a valid proxy before using <a href="#commandline">command line
  RFT clients</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure to provide suitable options to the client especially
for the Termination time so that the resource does not get destroyed
before finishing the transfers.<br>
