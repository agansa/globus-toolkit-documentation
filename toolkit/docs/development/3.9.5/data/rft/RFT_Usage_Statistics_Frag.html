The following usage statistics are sent by default in a UDP packet at the end
of life time of each RFT Resource (or when a RFT resource is destroyed).</p>
<ul>
    <li> Total number of files transferred by RFT since RFT is installed </li>
    <li> Total number of bytes transferred by RFT since RFT is installed </li>
    <li> Total number of files transferred in this RFT Resource </li>
    <li> Total number of bytes transferred in this RFT Resource </li>
    <li> Creation time of this RFT Resource </li>
    <li> Factory Start Time </li>
</ul>

<p>We have made a concerted effort to collect only data that is not too intrusive
or private, and yet still provides us with information that will help improve
the GRAM component.  Nevertheless, if you wish to disable this feature, please
see the Java WS Core System Adminstrator guide section on
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/common/javawscore/admin/#usageStatisticsTargets">Usage
Statistics Configuration</a> for instructions.  
</p>
<p>Also, please see our <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/Usage_Stats.html">policy statement </a> on
  the collection of usage statistics. </p>
