<h2><a name="whatistesting" id="whatistesting"></a>What is a "Call for
Community Testing"? </h2>
<p>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users that
new Globus code is available for testing in the field. Through these
calls, the Globus Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide variety
of usage scenarios early in its development process. The ultimate goals
are to catch bugs that have historically been found only after final
releases, and to elicit feedback from the community on ways our
software can be improved. </p>
<h2><a name="participating" id="participating"></a>Participating in the
RFT Testing Call is easy! </h2>
<ol>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending mail to <a
 href="mailto:testing@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> to let us know
that you're helping out and describing what you intend to test.</li>
  <li>Install the software in a non-production environment. Use the
3.9.4 distribution from <a
 href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/development/</a>;
the code can also be retrieved directly from CVS from the trunk.</li>
  <li>Exercise the software.</li>
  <li>Log your experiences in <a
 href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/">http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/</a>
under the "RFT" product. Please mention 3.9.4 explicitly in the body of
the report.</li>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> Consider sending descriptions of your tests to
    <a href="mailto:esting@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a> so that
we might use them to build standard tests in the future.</li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments about the process, send <a href="mailto:childers@mcs.anl.gov"></a>an
    email to <a href="mailto:esting@globus.org">testing@globus.org</a>. </li>
  <li>If you have any questions or comments regarding this component, join the
    gt4-friends list to participate in discussions with other testers. (To subscribe,
    send an email to <a href="mailto:majordomo@globus.org">majordomo@globus.org</a> containing
    the words "subscribe gt4-friends" in the message body.) </li>

<p>The testing period for this call is December 17 - January 31 2005.

<h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About RFT</h2>
RFT Service implementation in 3.9.4 uses standard SOAP messages over
HTTP to submit and manage a set of 3rd party GridFTP transfers and to
delete files using GridFTP. The user creates a RFT resource by
submitting a list of URL pairs of&nbsp; files that need to be
transferred/deleted&nbsp; to RFT Factory service. The user also
specifies the time to live for the resource the user is creating to a
GT 3.9.4 Container in which RFT is deployed and configured. The resource is
created after the user is properly authorized and authenticated. RFT
service implementation exposes operations to control and manage the
transfers (the resource). The operations exposed by both RFT factory
and RFT service are briefly described below. The resource the user
created also exposes the state of the transfer as a resource property
to which the user can either subscribe for changes or poll for the
changes in state periodically using standard command line clients.

<h2><a name="reasons"></a>Reasons for testing RFT</h2>
We need volunteers to stress test RFT to make it more scalable, robust.<br>
<h2><a name="dependencies" id="dependencies"></a>Technology
dependencies </h2>
RFT depends on WS-Core, WS-Delegation Service<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="envbuild"></a>Environment/build parameters and other
special conditions to test</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Submit a transfer request with lot of files ( &gt; 1000).</li>
  <li>Submit a directory with lot of files in it.<br>
  </li>
