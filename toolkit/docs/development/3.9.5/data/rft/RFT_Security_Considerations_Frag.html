<h3>Permissions of service configuration files</h3>
<p>

The service configuration files such as <code>jndi-config.xml</code> or <code>server-config.wsdd</code> 
(located under <code>etc/&lt;gar&gt;/</code> directory) contains private 
information such as database passwords and username. Ensure that these configuration 
files are only readable by the user that is running the container. </p>
<p>  The deployment process automatically sets the permissions of <code>
  jndi-config.xml</code> and <code>server-config.wsdd</code> files as user 
  readable only. However, this might not work correctly on all platforms and
   this does not apply to any other configuration files. </p>
<h3> Access of information stored in the database </h3>
<p>
RFT stores the transfer request in a database. Proper security measures need to 
be taken to protect the access of the data by granting/revoking appropriate 
permissions on tables that are created for RFT use and other steps that are 
appropriate and consistent with site specific security measures.
</p>
<h3>Permissions of persistent data</h3>
<p>
RFT uses subscription persistence API from GT4 core to store all of its subscription data under the <code>~/.globus/pe
rsisted</code> directory. Ensure that the entire <code>~/.globus/persisted
</code> directory is only readable by the user running the container.
</p>

<h3> Permissions of user's delegated proxy credential file </h3>
<p>
User's delegated proxy is stored in a file in /tmp directory ( on the host running the container ) and appropriate permissions are set on it so it can be accessed only by user running the container. This file is removed by the container after the expiration of RFT resource time to live. If it is removed manually before the expiration of resource lifetime all the transfers will fail. The transfers will also fail to start if there is not enough free space in /tmp dir to store the delegated credential.
