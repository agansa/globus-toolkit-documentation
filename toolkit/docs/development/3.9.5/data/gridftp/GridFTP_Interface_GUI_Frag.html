<p>Globus does not provide any interactive client for GridFTP, either GUI or text
  based. However, NCSA, as part of there TeraGrid activity, produces a text based
  interactive client called UberFTP, which you may want to check out. See <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/data/gridftp/GridFTP_Public_Interfaces.html#cmd">Interactive
  clients</a> for more information. </p>
