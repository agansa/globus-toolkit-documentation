<p>Features new in release GT 3.9.5: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial implementation of the Data Replication Service: a WS-Resource, called the <i>Replicator</i>, which accepts a request from a client to locate, transfer, and register new replicas of data files in the Grid environment.</li>
  <li>A simple command-line tool to request replication activities: the tool <code>globus-replication-create</code> accepts a replication request file, initializes a replication request, delegates the user credential, creates a Replicator resource, and starts the Replicator. See <code>globus-replication-create --help</code> for command-line options. The <i>replication request file</i> is expected to contain tab-delimited rows where the first field is the LFN name that the user wishes to locate and replicate, and the second field is the URL of the destination for the new replica and is also used as the PFN name when registering the new mapping.</li>
  <li>APIs to <i>create</i> and <i>start</i> the replication operations: The APIs are specified as SOAP operations <code>createReplicator</code> and <code>start</code> as defined in the service's WSDL and XML Schema (for more details, <a href="http://viewcvs.globus.org/viewcvs.cgi/ws-replica/replicator/common/schema/replica/replicator/?only_with_tag=globus_3_9_5">click here</a> for a file listing from the Globus CVS repository).</li>
<!-- 
  <li>Create Replicator: user creates a replicator resource by specifying a set of desired files identified by their logical filenames (see RLS) and the target physical filenames to which copies should be transfered.</li>
  <li>Start Replicator: user starts the replicator resource thus invoking the replication activities which include locating, transfering, and registering new replicas.</li>
  <li>Replicator Resource Properties: user may get resource properties of the Replicator (refer to schema for details on resource properties of the Replicator).</li>
  <li><code>globus-replication-create</code>: command line tool accepts a replication request file, initializes a replication request, delegates the user credential, creates a Replicator resource, and starts the Replicator. See <code>globus-replication-create \-\-help</code> for help. The <i>replication request file</i> is expected to contain tab-delimited rows where the first field is the LFN name that the user wishes to locate and replicate, and the second field is the URL of the destination of the new replica and is also used as the PFN name when registering the new mapping.</li>
