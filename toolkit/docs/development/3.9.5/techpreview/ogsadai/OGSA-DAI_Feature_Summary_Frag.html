<p>Features new in release Globus Toolkit 4.0 </p>
<ul>
  <li> Access to data is provided via an "OGSA-DAI data service". For those that
    have previously used the OGSI version of OGSA-DAI, this service amalgamates
    the capabilities of the <i>Grid Data Service Factory</i> (GDSF) and <i>Grid
    Data Service</i> (GDS) services (the metadata and configuration roles of
    the GDSF and the metadata and perform document processing aspects of the
    GDS). </li>
  <li> Allows multiple data resources to be accessed through a single service.
    Data resource identifiers, available from the data service's WS-Addressing
    endpoint reference, allow a client to target a specific data resource. </li>
  <li> A <em>listResources()</em> operation is provided for a data service to
    list all the identifiers of the data resources exposed by that service. </li>
  <li> The data resource identifiers returned by a data service can subsequently
    be used by a client to obtain metadata and other information, about the data
    resources corresponding to that identifier. </li>
  <li> Access to service metadata (such as database schemas, request status,
    etc.) is provided by an implementation of the <em>WS-ResourceProperties</em> specification.
    In particular support for using the <em>QueryResourceProperties</em>,<em> GetResourceProperties</em> and <em>GetMultipleResourceProperties</em> portTypes
    is provided. </li>
  <li> Access to version information about the OGSA-DAI Data Service is available
    through the <em>getVersion()</em> operation. </li>
  <li> A WSRF version of the OGSA-DAI <em>GridDataTransport</em> portType supports
    asynchronous data delivery between data services. </li>
</ul>
<p> Features that continue to be supported from previous versions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform documents.</li>
  <li>Extensible activity framework.</li>
  <li>Statement, delivery and transformation activities.</li>

<p>Deprecated Features</p>
<ul>
  <li> The OGSA-DAI Client Toolkit has not been updated yet to support interaction
    with WSRF-enabled OGSA-DAI services. This will be made available in a future
    version. </li>
  <li> The OGSA-DAI registry service, DAISGR, has not been updated for WS-RF.
    This will be addressed in a future version or provided via a third party
    component. </li>
  <li> The old graphical demonstrator no longer works with this version of OGSA-DAI. </li>
</ul>
