<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a guide for using the GSI-enabled OpenSSH client. It assumes
that you (or your system administrator) 
have already
installed the GSI OpenSSH
and that you have also
acquired a user certificate from an appropriate Certificate Authority.
</p>

<p>
First, set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the location of your
GSI-enabled OpenSSH installation.
It may already be set for you by your system administrator.
Then, create a proxy credential for GSI authentication by running the
<code>grid-proxy-init</code> program.
This is your single sign-on to the Grid.
By default, <code>grid-proxy-init</code> will create a proxy
credential good for 12 hours. 
To create a proxy credential with a different lifetime, use the
<code>-hours</code> option.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
% grid-proxy-init -hours 8
</blockquote>
<p>
To delete a proxy that was previously create with grid-proxy-init, run:
</p>
<blockquote>
% grid-proxy-destroy
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="authorization">Getting authorized to connect to a site</a></h3>
<p>
Before you can connect to a site the site needs to know the identity
in your certificate so that they can map that identity to your
local account.  At a minimum, the site will need to know your subject
name from your certificate.  You can get your subject name by running
<code>grid-cert-info</code> with the <code>-subject</code> argument.
For example: 
</p>

<blockquote>
% grid-cert-info -subject
</blockquote>

<p>
Email your subject to the administrator of the system you wish to
connect to so that they can add your entry to the appropriate
authorization files.
</p>

<p>
Once you have your proxy credential all you should have to do is run
gsissh providing it with the hostname of the host you want to connect
to.  For example:
</p>

<div class="content-code-box">
% gsissh myhost.somedomain.edu
</div>

<p>
You should then find
yourself automatically logged into your account on the remote system.

<p>
Some common errors are listed below. If you need additional assistance
please run gsissh with the '-vvv' argument (specifying verbose output) and
send the output to your system administrator for assistance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a name="expired">GSS-API error Failuring acquiring GSSAPI
      credentials: GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED</a>
    <p>This means that your proxy certificate has expired. You need to
      run <code>grid-proxy-init</code> to acquire a new proxy
      certificate, then run gsissh again. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="passphrase">The gsissh command
      prompts you for a pass phrase when you run it</a>
    <p>This could mean that you don't have a proxy certificate, try
      running <code>grid-proxy-init</code> and then running gsissh again. It
      could also mean that the GSI authentication is failing for some
      reason and gsissh is falling back to a different authentication
      mechanism. Reasons that it might fail include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The host you are connecting to does not have a GSI-enabled
      OpenSSH server. </li>
      <li>You are not authorized to use GSI authentication to the host. Contact the administrator. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
