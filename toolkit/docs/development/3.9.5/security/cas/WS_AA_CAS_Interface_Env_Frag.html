<p>All CAS client program use the following environment variables to
determine the appropriate URL to connect to and server identity to
expect. In all cases, the command line option takes precedence over
the environmant variables.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a name="urlOption"></a>The URL is determined using this algorithm:

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-c</b> commandline option was specified, the URL
specified with that option is used.</li>

<li>Otherwise, the <b>CAS_SERVER_URL</b> environment variable must be
set, and its value is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li> <a name="serverIdentity"></a> The server identity (i.e. the
expected subject name of the CAS server certificate) is determined as
follows:

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-s</b> commandline option was specified, the
value specified with that option is used as the identity</li>

<li>Otherwise, if the <b>CAS_SERVER_IDENTITY</b> environment variable
is set, use the value of that variable as the expected server
identity.</li>

<li>If neither is set, host authorization is done and the expected
server credential is <i>cas/&lt;fqdn&gt;</i>, where &lt;fqdn&gt; is
the fully qualified domain name of the host on which the CAS service
is up.</li> </ul>
