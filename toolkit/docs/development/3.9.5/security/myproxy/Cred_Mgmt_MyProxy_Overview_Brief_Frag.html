MyProxy is an online credential repository.
You can store X.509 proxy credentials in the MyProxy repository,
protected by a passphrase,
for later retrieval over the network. This 
eliminates the need for manually copying private key and certificate
files between machines.
MyProxy can also be used for authentication to grid portals and
credential renewal with job managers.
