<h3>Configuration overview</h3>

<p>The security settings for Delegation Factory Service and Delegation
Service can be configured by modifying the security descriptor. It
allows for configuring in the credentials that will be used by the
service, type of authentication and authorization that needs to be
enforced.</p>

<p> By default, the following configuration is installed:</p>
<ul>
<li> Delegation Factory Service:
<ul>
<li> Credentials set for use by container is used. If that is not
specified, default credentials are used.</li>
<li> GSI Secure message authentication is enforced for
<i>requestSecurityToken</i> operation. No authentication is
required for all other operations.</li>
<li> Gridmap authorizatin is done and the gridmap file is read from
<code>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<li> Delegation Service</li>
<ul>
<li> Credentials set for use by container is used. If that is not
specified, default credentials are used.</li>
<li> GSI Secure message authentication is enforced for
<i>refresh</i> operation. No authentication is required for all
other operations.</li>
<li> Gridmap authorization is done and the gridmap file is read from
<code>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Changing required authentication and authorization
  method will require suitable changes to the clients that contact this
  service.
