<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The aggregator  framework allows pluggable data sources and sinks to 
be written and connected together. Generally a source collects data
from or about a particular grid resource, and passes it to a sink
which does something interesting with it.
</p>
<p>The aggregator sinks supplied with the toolkit implement the 
<a href="../../index">WS MDS Index Service</a> and 
<a href="../../trigger">WS MDS Trigger Service</a>.  The
aggregator sources supplied with the toolkit collect information
using resource property queries, subscription/notification, and
execution of external programs.
</p>
<p>This document describes the programmatic interfaces to the aggregator
framework.  General Globus Toolkit coding guidelines and best practices
can be found in the
<a href="../../../">Globus Toolkit general documentation</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="archdes"></a>Architecture and design overview</h2>
<p>The WS-MDS Aggregator is the software framework on which WS-MDS services
are built.  The
aggregator framework collects data from an <i>aggregator source</i> and sends
that data to an <i>aggregator sink</i> for processing.  Aggregator sources
distributed with the Globus Toolkit include modules that query service data,
acquire data through subscription/notification, and execute programs to generate
data.</p>
<img src="../info_flow.jpg" />
<p>The Aggregator framework is designed to facilitate the collecting
of information from or about WS-Resources via plugin aggregator sources and
the feeding of that information to plugin aggregator sinks, which can
then perform actions such as re-publishing, logging,
or archiving the information.</p>
<p>Aggregators work on a type of service group called an
<code>AggregatorServiceGroupRP</code>.
Resources may be <i>registered</i> to an AggregatorServiceGroupRP using the
service group <code>add</code> operation, which will cause an entry
to be added to the service group.  The entry will include configuration
parameters for the aggregator source; when the
registration is made, the appropriate aggregation source and sinks will be informed; the aggregator source will begin collecting data and inserting it into
the corresponding service group entry, and the aggregator sink will begin
processing the information in the service group entries.</p>
<p>The method of collection by source and processing by the sink is dependent on the particular instantiation of the aggregator framework.</p>
<p>
The aggregator sinks distributed with the toolkit
(<code>org.globus.mds.aggregator.impl.ServiceGroupEntryAggregatorSink</code> and
<code>org.globus.mds.trigger.impl.TriggerResource</code>) are described in the
following table.</p>

<tr><th valign="top">Aggregator Sink</th>
<th valign="top">Service Implemented</th>
<th valign="top">Description</th>

<tr>
<td><code>ServiceGroupEntryAggregatorSink</code></td>
<td>Index Service</td>
<td valign="top">The servicegroup sink (used by the Index Service) publishes received 
data as content in the AggregatingServiceGroup entry used to manage 
the registration. This data can therefore be retrieved by querying
the index for its 'entries' resource property.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>TriggerResource</code></td>
<td>Trigger Service</td>
<td valign="top">The trigger service provides an aggregator  sink which 
receives data, applies tests to that data, and if the tests match, 
runs a specified executable. See the 
<a href="../../trigger/">trigger service</a> documentation for 
more information.

<p>The aggregator sources supplied with the toolkit are listed in the
following table.  Note:  all aggregator sources listed in this table
are in the <code>org.globus.mds.aggregator.impl</code> package, so for 
example the aggregator source listed as <code>QueryAggregatorSource</code>
is actually
<code>org.globus.mds.aggregator.impl.QueryAggregatorSource</code></p>

<tr><th valign="top">QueryAggregatorSource</th>
    <td valign="top">
        The query source collects information from a registered resource by
        using WS-Resource Properties polling mechanisms (the
        GetResourceProperty, GetResourceProperties and 
        QueryResourceProperties operations). Polls are made periodically,
        with both the period and target Resource Properties specified
        in the registration message.
    </td>

<tr><th valign="top">SubscriptionAggregatorSource</th>
    <td valign="top">The subscription source collects information from a registered 
        resource using WS-Notification mechanisms. Data is delivered when
        property values change, rather than periodically.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr><th valign="top">ExecutionAggregatorSource</th>
    <td valign="top">The execution source collects information about (not necessarily
        from) a registered resource by execution of a local executable, which
        is passed as input the identity of the registered resource. 
        Details of the interface between the execution source and local
        executables are in

<p>The semantics and syntax of the APIs and WSDL for the component, along with
  descriptions of domain-specific structured interface data, can be found in

<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Usage scenarios</h2>
<p>The aggregator framework is used to create MDS services, linking an
<i>aggregator source</i> (a java class that implements the AggregatorSource
interface to collect data) to an <i>aggregator sink</i> (a java class that
implements the AggregatorSink interface to process data, e.g., by providing
a service interface for it).  The AggregatorSource and AggregatorSink interfaces
are documented in the aggregator
<a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html">Public Interface Guide</a>.
