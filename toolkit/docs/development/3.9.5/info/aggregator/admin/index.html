<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with WS MDS Aggregator. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation.</p>

<P>This information is in addition to the basic installation instructions in
  the <a href="../../../admin/docbook/">GT 3.9.5 System Administrator's Guide</a>.</P>
<h2><a name="installing"></a>Building and Installing</h2>

<p>The aggregator  framework is built and installed as part of the standard
  <a href="../../../admin/docbook/">Globus Toolkit installation procedure</a>.


<h2><a name="configuring"></a>Configuring</h2>
<?php
include_once( "./../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Interface_Config_Frag.html" );
?>
<p>The aggregator  framework does not have its own service side configuration,
  although services which are based on the framework have their own service side
configuration options, documented in the per-service documentation.</p>
<p>Registrations to a working aggregator framework are configured for the <code>mds-servicegroup-add</code> tool,
  which is documented in the <a href="../WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html#cmd">public
  interface guide</a>. This tool takes an XML configuration file listing registrations,
  and causes thoses registrations to be made.</p>
<p>The tool can be deployed at the aggregating service, at resource services,
  or at any other location. This allows registrations to be configured by the
  administrator of the aggregating service, or by the administrator of resources,
  by a third party, or by some combination of those.</p>
Three Aggregator Sources are included in the Globus Toolkit distribution:
<ul>
  <li> The <code>QueryAggregatorSource</code> gathers resource property values
    from the registered resource using one of the three WS-Resource Properties
    poll operations. .</li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>GetResourcePropertyPollType</code>; requests a single Resource
      Property from the remote resource. </li>
    <li><code>GetMultipleResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests multiple
      Resource Properties from the remote resource. </li>
    <li><code>QueryResourcePropertiesPollType</code>; requests a query be executed
      against the Resource Property Set of the remote resource. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <code>SubscriptionAggregatorSource</code> gathers resource property
    values from the registered resource using WS-Notification subscriptions. </li>
  <li>The <code>ExecutionAggregatorSource</code> gathers arbitrary XML information
    about a registered resource by executing an external script and passing registration
    as parameters. See the <a href="../developer/">developers guide</a> for details
    of this API.
