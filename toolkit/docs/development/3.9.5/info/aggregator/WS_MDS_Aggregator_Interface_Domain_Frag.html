<h3>Execution aggregation source interface introduction</h3>

<p>The execution aggregation source provides a way to aggregate 
data about a registered resource using an arbitrary local executable.
The executable will be passed registration information and is 
expected to output the gathered data, as detailed below.</p>

<p>A basic example of the use of this API is described in the 
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/info/aggregator/developer/pingtest.html">ping test 
example for the aggregator  execution source</a>

<h3>Syntax of the execution aggregation source interface</h3>
<p>
The execution aggregation source will periodically execute 
an identified executable. The identity of the executable and the
frequency with which it is to run are specified in the registration
message.</p>

<h4>Name of executable</h4>

<p>The executable to run will be 
<code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/aggrexec/&lt;scriptname&gt;</code>
with <code>scriptname</code> supplied in the registration message.
</p>

<h4>Input to executable</h4>
<p>
Information about the registration will be supplied as commandline
parameters and on stdin. 
</p>

<p>A single commandline parameter will be supplied to the executable.
This will be the URL from the EPR of the registered service.
</p>

<p>Two XML documents will be send to stdin, in sequence. The first 
document will be the full EPR to the registered service. The second
document will be the AggregatorConfig block from the registration
message.</p>


<h4>Output from executable</h4>
<p>
The executable must output a well-formed XML document to stdout. This
output document will be delivered into the aggregator  framework.
