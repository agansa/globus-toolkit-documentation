<p>There is no GUI specifically for the Trigger Service. The release contains
   a tech preview of <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/techpreview/webmds/index.html">WebMDS</a>
   which can be used to display the status of resources registered to 
   a Trigger Service in a normal web browser.
