<h3>Interface introduction</h3>
<p>The trigger service provides an API to action scripts, which 
are executed when trigger rules fire. These take the form of 
fork-exec executables (written in any language) which are 
supplied with rule information on stdin and must output status
information on stdout.

<h3>Syntax of the interface</h3>
<p>Trigger action scripts take the form of native OS executables, and
so can be written in any language that can generate such (for example,
bash, PERL, C).
</p>

<p>Information on the match that caused an action to fire is fed 
into the action script through <code>stdin</code>. Status information 
from the action script should be sent to <code>stdout</code>, and 
will reported in the content of the ServiceGroupEntry for the rule.
</p>

<h3>Format of action script stdin</h3>

<p>
An XML document of the following format will be piped to the stdin of
the action script:
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;fire&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;
 The message which caused the rule to file.
    &lt;/message&gt;

    &lt;MemberEPR&gt;
 The EPR of the service registered for the firing rule.
    &lt;/MemberEPR&gt;

    &lt;AggregatorConfig&gt;
 The aggregator configuration element for this rule.
    &lt;/AggregatorConfig&gt;
  &lt;/fire&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The presence of the aggregator framework configuration element allows for
additional parameters to be passed to the action script in 
registrations.
</p>

<h3>Format of action script stdout</h3>

<p>The action script should output an XML document to stdout. The 
xml document does not need to match any particular schema. This
output will be included in the ServiceGroupEntry for the rule.
</p>
