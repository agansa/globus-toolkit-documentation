<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The WS MDS Trigger Service collects information about Grid resources and can be configured to execute a program if the collected data meets certain conditions.
This document describes the programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service.
</p>
<h2><a name="archdes"></a>Architecture and design overview</h2>
The Trigger Service collects information and acts on it, by executing an
administrator-supplied executable program when certain conditions (expressed
as XPath matches on the collected information) are met.  There are two
programmatic interfaces to the Trigger Service:  information is collected
using an Aggregator Source and acted upon by an executable program.</p>
<p>There is no "client" interface to the Trigger Service -- "clients" will
typically interact with the Trigger Service indirectly, using some mechanism
specific to the triggered executable program (for example, an executable
program may send mail to an end-user or write a structured log file that
will later be read by some other program).</p>
<h2><a name="pubinterfaces"></a>Public interface</h2>
<p>The public interfaces for specifying trigger actions, including
specifications for executable programs to be executed by the trigger,
can be found in
the <a href="../WS_MDS_Trigger_Public_Interfaces.html">Trigger
Service Public Interface Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The public interfaces for creating and configuring aggregator sources --
sources of information used by the trigger service -- can be found in
the
<a href="../../aggregator/WS_MDS_Aggregator_Public_Interfaces.html">Aggregator
Framework Public Interface Guide</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>Usage scenarios</h2>
<h3>Controlling information collected by the Trigger Service</h3>
Information is collected by the Trigger Service by way of an <i>aggregator source</i>.  The
Globus Toolkit distribution includes several standard aggregator sources
(see the <a href="../admin">Administrator's Guide</a> for more details).
To create your own custom information source, see the
<a href="../../aggregator/developer">WS MDS Aggregator Developer's Guide</a>.
<h3>Controlling the Conditions Under Which the Executable is Executed</h3>
This is handled through configuation options (see the
<a href="../admin/#configuring">WS MDS Trigger Service Administration Guide</a>
for details).
<h3>Programming the Executable</h3>
The executable program triggered by the Trigger Service can be written in any
programming or scripting language.  The specifications for this program are
documented in the
<a href="../WS_MDS_Trigger_Public_Interfaces.html#domain">WS MDS Trigger
Public Interfaces Guide</a>.

<h2><a name="debugging"></a>Debugging</h2>
<p>
See the <a href="../../../common/javawscore/developer/#debugging">Debug section of the Java WS Core Developer's Guide</a>
for general information on logging, including which files to edit to set
logging properties.
</p>
<p>
To turn on debug logging for the Trigger Service, add the line:
</p>
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.mds.trigger=DEBUG
</pre>
<p>
to the appropriate properties file.  Since the Trigger Service is implemented
using the aggregator framework, you may also want to turn on aggregator
debugging by adding this line:
</p>
<pre>
log4j.category.org.globus.mds.aggregator=DEBUG
</pre>
