<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<p>Index service queries are performed using resource property requests; consult
the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/common/javawscore">Java
WS Core documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>The contents of an index are maintained using the 
aggregator framework programming model, and
can receive data from any aggregator  source.
Information about how to configure existing aggregator  sources (such
  as the aggregator  sources distributed with the Globus Toolkit, which
  include one that polls for resource property information, one that collects
  resource property information through subscription/notification, and one that
  collects information by executing an executable program) is found in the
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/info/index/WS_MDS_Index_Public_Interfaces.html#config">MDS Index Public
Interface Guide</a>; information about how to create new aggregator 
sources can be found in the
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/info/aggregator/index.html">aggregator framework documentation</a>.</p>
