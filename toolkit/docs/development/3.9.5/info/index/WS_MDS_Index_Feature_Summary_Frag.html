<p>Features new in release 4.0 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Based on WSRF rather than OGSI
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregated data is published
          through WS-Resource Properties mechanisms</li>
      <li>The aggregator framework module (basis of the index service) collects
        data from monitored resources using WS-Resource Properties collection
        mechanisms, including the base WS-Resource Properties poll operations
            and WS-Notification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Persistent configuration of aggregations has been refactored. The service
      no longer has its own config file for specifying aggregations. 
      Instead a separate client is used to
      make appropriate registrations. This client may be started alongside the
      container for the equivalent effect. The client may also be deployed
      elsewhere to support resource-side configuration (providing similar
      functionality to the GT3.2 RegistryPublishProvider) or at a third 
    location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Supported Features
<ul>
  <li>The index appears as a ServiceGroup (defined in WSRF) which lists
      registered resources alongside dynamically collected information 
      from those resources. This information can be examined using 
      (for example) XPath queries to discover resources that match
    desired constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deprecated Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Xindice and aggregated data persistence has been removed.</li>
  <li>The ability to specify default aggregations in service config file has
    been removed (see item in 'New Features').</li>
  <li>Non-ServiceGroupRegistration methods for managing aggregations have been
      removed; the equivalent functionality is available through the
      ServiceGroupRegistration port type which is available in both GT3.2 and 
    GT 3.9.3.0 versions of the index service.</li>
</ul>
