<h3>Programming Model Overview</h3>
<h4>Internationalization Infrastructure</h4>

<p>The Globus Toolkit C Common Library now has optional infrastructure support
 for internationalization, which is used by GridFTP and its dependencies (pre-ws authorization/authentication and XIO).</p>

<p>This means that user-presented strings are wrapped in a lookup function,
which, if the globus_i18n module is installed, and the GLOBUS_I18N environment variable is set to "YES" will lookup the string in a resource bundle using ICU4C.  If GLOBUS_I18N is set to "NO", or the globus_i18n module is not installed, or the string value cannot be found in the resource bundle, the default string (exactly what was being looked up) is returned.</p>


<h4>Developer Information</h4>

<p>There are two functions that are used for string lookup.</p>
<p>The first is the preferred function; you supply a module descriptor and the
  string that you want to look up: </p>
<pre>
globus_common_i18n_get_string(
 			              globus_module_descriptor_t * module,
                        char * key);
</pre>
<p>The second function is used if you need to look up a particular locale.
A NULL value for locale will look up from the default locale:</p>

<pre>
globus_common_i18n_get_string_by_key(
                       char * locale,
                       char * resource_name,
                       char * key);
</pre>
<p>
Typically, one or more macros will be defined on a per-module basis that supply the module descriptor, to reduce clutter in the code.  Within the toolkit, these are typically _???SL where ??? are some mnemonic for the module in question  (for example _GCSL is defined for globus_common). </p>

<p>The resource bundles used for the string lookups are created using ICU4C (see <a href= "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/ResourceManagement.html"> IBM
    documentation on Resource Bundles)</a>.</p>

<p>Our resource bundles are very simple; they contain simply a set of keys and
  strings. The key is actually the string itself: it is hashed using the globus_hashtable_string_hash
  function, then converted to contain only invariant characters ( #!@[]^`{|}~
  are converted to '_'). See globus_i18n_resource_init.c in the globus_i18n source
  for an example of creating keys.</p>

  <p>While resource bundles for the Globus Toolkit are not by default created as part of the build process nor distributed in our binary distributions, there is a tool distributed with the globus_i18n package that makes them simple to construct.</p>
  <p> Invoking globus-i18n-resource-create &lt;module name&gt; from the top level directory of a built (or at least configured) source package will generate a resource bundle for that package which can then be moved to $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/i18n/ </p>
  <p>globus-i18n-resource-create is part of the globus_i18n package, and will be installed if --enable-i18n was given as a configure option to the installer.  globus-i18n-resource create uses globus-i18n-resource-init and genrb from ICU4C to create the resource bundles. </p>

<p>Resource bundles must be installed in <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/i18n/ </code></p>
