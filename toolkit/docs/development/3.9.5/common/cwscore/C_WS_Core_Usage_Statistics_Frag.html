<p>
The following usage statistics are sent by C WS Core by default in a UDP packet
  :</p>
<ul>
<li>  Component identifier </li>

<li> Usage data format identifier </li>
<li> Time stamp </li>
<li> Source IP address </li>
<li> Source hostname (to differentiate between hosts with identical private
        IP addresses)</li>
</ul>


<p>
 It sends it at container startup and receipt of that packet tells us that
the container started. </p>
<p>If you wish to disable this feature, please see the Java
