<p> Subscribe to the Globus Toolkit's RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed to
  get news about downloads and other timely GT information delivered directly
  to you via an <a href="#rssagg">RSS Aggregator</a>. RSS is an XML-based format
  for sharing and distributing Web content, such as news headlines. Using an
  RSS reader, you can view data feeds from various news sources and weblogs,
  including headlines, summaries, and links to full stories.<br>
  <br>
  <b>To view the feed in your RSS Aggregator</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the URL of the XML icon (either click
        on the icon and copy the URL or right click/option click and choose 'Copy
    link location').</li>
  <li> Paste the URL into your reader. (For some aggregators, you can simply
    right click/option click and 'bookmark' the feed to a special folder) </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="rssagg"></a>RSS Aggregators</h2>
<p>RSS/News Aggregators (also called Readers) will download and display
RSS feeds for you. A number of free and commercial News Aggregators are
available for download. Simply do a search on Google (or try Sage for Firefox
browsers).<br>
<br>
Many aggregators are separate, "stand-alone" programs; other services will let
you add RSS feeds to a Web page.</p>
