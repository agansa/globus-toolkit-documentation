<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

        

      <p>Please note that in the GT4 pre-WS build, MDS2 is not installed by default.
        This is because of security concerns with two third-party libraries,
        Open LDAP v.2.0.22 and Cyrus SASL (v. 1.5.27). That version of OpenLDAP
        has security vulnerabilities that are no longer being patched due to
        the age of the version (the current version is 2.2.25). This means that
        anyone who runs MDS2 on their server has a chance of being affected by
        this, although we have no reported cases of this occurring. A similar
        situation exists for the version of Cyrus SASL we are using although
        this can be avoided by not using MDS2 in secure-mode.</p>
      <p>An unsupported, minimally-tested version of MDS2 based on more recent,
        more secure versions of OpenLDAP and Cyrus SASL is available for download
        below;
        however, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that any MDS2 users upgrade
        their system to use the new WSRF-based MDS4, and we will be happy to
        work with you to make this possible for your project. Please note that
        in GT4, MDS2 is a deprecated component, which means that it will not
        be included in the GT4.2 release, nor supported once GT4.4 exists.</p>
      <h2>Patch</h2>
      <p>This patch consists of 2 source tarballs  based on two original
        GT src bundles releases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/ftppub/gt4/4.0/4.0.0/updates/src/globus-information-services-client-4.0.tar.gz">globus-information-services-client-4.0.tar.gz</a></li>
        <li> <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/ftppub/gt4/4.0/4.0.0/updates/src/globus-information-services-server-4.0.tar.gz">globus-information-services-server-4.0.tar.gz</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p> We have brought in newer SASL and Openldap code into MDS2 code base
        and patched and updated related modules. We used cyrus-sasl-2.1.20 and
        openldap-2.2.23. Both new SASL and Openldap sources were modified directly
instead of generating a separate patch-and-build file.</p>
      <h2>Installing the patch</h2>
      <p>        Both tarballs can be built with GPT like the original src tar balls.</p>
      <p> <strong>Note:</strong> There will be many warnings about &quot;too
        many arguments for format&quot; during compilation. These warnings should
        not affect the working of the code. They are due to the newer error message
        output routine that newer Openldap has adopted but we did not update
        to it.</p>
      <h2>List of changes </h2>
      <p> Here is a quick list of affected modules and changes that were made:</p>
