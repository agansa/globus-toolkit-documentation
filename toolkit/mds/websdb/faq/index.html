<p><a name="links"></a><strong>What do the <em>Details</em>, <em>History</em>, and
<em>Overview</em> links mean?</strong></p>
<p>The <em><strong>Details</strong></em> link displays the specific service data associated
  with the chosen service or monitored resource, associated with a specific GMT
  timestamp.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>If you click this link from the <strong>Live
    Overview</strong> page, you will see the live service data from the most
    recent report. </li>
  <li>If you click this link from any <strong>History</strong> page, you will
    see the service data from that point in history. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em><strong>History</strong></em> link takes you to a page on which you see, initially,
  the most recent 6 hours of state associated with the service or monitored resource
  you selected. On this page you can adjust the time frame and requery to see
  a longer or shorter period. </p>
<p>The <em><strong>Overview</strong></em> link, which is available from both the <strong>Detail</strong>  and <strong>History</strong> pages,
  gives you the state of all monitored services and resources associated with
  the time you chose. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If you click this link from
        a <strong>Detail</strong> page, and that detail is from time <em>T</em>,
        then you will see the state of all services at time <em>T</em>. </li>
  <li>If you click this link
        from a <strong>History</strong> page, then depending upon which row/timestamp
        you select, you will see the state of all services at that same time. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="timeout"></a><strong>When I query for history, why does it time out?</strong></p>
<p>If you've asked for history over a significant period of time, especially
  if the data is reported often, you are triggering a query that needs to return
  a very large amount of data. This may take a long time, and, you might get
  various results, including partial data, or no data, depending upon the vagaries
of the Java heap. Try using a shorter, more targeted time period.</p>
<p><a name="nomatchingrows"></a><strong>Why are there no matching rows?</strong></p>
<p>See above.</p>
<p><a name="duplicaterows"></a><strong>Why are there duplicate rows?</strong></p>
<p>This happens when reported data have overlapping GoodFrom/GoodUntil values.
  For example, if a service reports at 13:00 with GoodUntil 13:45, and then reports
  again at 13:30 with GoodUntil of 14:15, a query for time 13:35 will return
  both rows.</p>
