<h2><a name="mds_gt3"></a>MDS in GT3</h2>
<p>Developed with Globus Toolkit 3.x, MDS3 is an OGSI implementation of information
  services and is available in Globus Toolkit 3.0 and 3.2. Includes the Index
  Service and Service Data Providers (corresponds to the Information Providers
  of <a href="#mds_gt2">MDS2</a>) with three Provider interfaces. MDS3 is
  compatible with the Web Service Data Browser tool (which is the OGSI implementation
of WebMDS).</p>
<p>To support existing deployments, GT3 distributions also include <a href="#mds_gt2">MDS2</a> (also
  referred to as Pre-Web Services MDS). </p>

<h2><a name="mds_gt2"></a>MDS in GT2</h2>
<p>Developed with Globus Toolkit 2.x, MDS2 is an LDAP-based implementation of
  information services. This component is also available in later versions of
  the Globus Toolkit (3.0, 3.2 and 4.0) to support existing deployments. It is
  based on OpenLDAP and fully implements referral with a combined GRIS and GIIS
  listening on port 2135 and answering queries based on the ``Mds-VO-name'' string.
  Mds-VO-Name=local refers to the GRIS and anything else refers to a GIIS if
it exists with that name. </p>
<p>Includes: GRIS, GIIS and information providers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GT 2.x is no longer supported. </p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="sec_notice"></a>Security Notice for MDS 2.4 in the Globus Toolkit 4.0 Release </h3>
  <p>Please note that in the GT4 pre-WS build, MDS2 is not installed by default.
    This is because of security concerns with two third-party libraries, Open LDAP
    v.2.0.22 and Cyrus SASL (v. 1.5.27). That version of OpenLDAP has security
    vulnerabilities that are no longer being patched due to the age of the version
    (the current version is 2.2.25). This means that anyone who runs MDS2 on their
    server has a chance of being affected by this, although we have no reported
    cases of this occurring. A similar situation exists for the version of Cyrus
    SASL we are using although this can be avoided by not using MDS2 in secure-mode.</p>
  <p>An unsupported, minimally-tested version of MDS2 based on more recent, more
    secure versions of OpenLDAP and Cyrus SASL is available for download <a href="patch_for_mds2_in_gt40.html">here</a>;
    however, we strongly recommend that any MDS2 users upgrade their system to
    use the new WSRF-based MDS4, and we will be happy to work with you to make
    this possible for your project. Please note that in GT4, MDS2 is a depreciated
    component, which means that it will not be included in the GT4.2 release, nor
    supported once GT4.4 exists.</p>
