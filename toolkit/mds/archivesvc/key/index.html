<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Archive Service (AS) is much like the Index Service in that it is a Grid
  service which allows you to collect service data from other Grid services.
  However, the Index Service only aggregates and publishes current data from
  these subscriptions, constantly replacing existing service data with new service
  data. In contrast, the AS is a Grid Service designed to <strong>preserve</strong> service
  data history.&nbsp; The
  AS accumulates service data values over time and, according to various optional
  storage management strategies, stores the archive in a persistent Xindice database
  and allows time-based queries of this service data via Xpath.</p>
<p>The AS is currently only compatible with the Globus Toolkit 3.2. We are 
  developing a version that will be compatible with the upcoming 4.0 release. </p>
<p>The following diagram describes AS deployment options at the highest level:</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a>Features</h2>
<p>The Archive Service features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a history of SDEs to the users by saving
    notification messages from SDEs into a persistent database</li>
  <li>Xpath
    query capabilities to retrieve the history from the database</li>
  <li> indexing special
        timestamps for faster time-related queries.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Archive Service was implemented in a Monitoring System for ESG (www.earthsystemgrid.org).
  The details are described in the paper <a href="http://www.globus.org/research/papers/Use_Case_ESG_MDS3.pdf" target="_blank">Globus Toolkit MDS3 Use Case:
  A Monitoring System for the ESG Earth System Grid</a>.<br>
