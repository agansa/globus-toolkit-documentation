Python cgi scripts for mds queries

The scripts were written for a client -> server -> server -> GIIS setup, 
where both servers were located on different machines.  

A query is initiated by invoking mds_query.py; this script marshalls the form data 
that is expected by the server script contacting the GIIS.  It also formats the 
return data as html tables.

mds_grid_search_basic.py contacts the GIIS and requests an mds search.  For returning 
data to the original server script, it parses the returned GIIS data and creates a 
structured data file with the help of a header file that contains data structures,
mdsDatakeys.py, and a parser, mdsParser.py.  NOTE: The script requests all objects 
from the GIIS and only filters the output based on input parameters.

The perl script creates a template for mdsDatakeys.py, if need be.
