<h1>Using MDS3 to Create a Monitoring Service </h1>
<p>This article describes how to build a Monitoring Service by integrating four
  MDS components&mdash;the Index Service, Web Service Data Browser, Archive Service,
and Trigger Service&mdash;with client-specific test and trigger scripts.</p>

<h2><a name="components"></a>Components</h2>
<p>This section describes the MDS components used to build a monitoring framework.</p>
<h3>Index Service </h3>
<p>The MDS3 <strong>Index Service</strong> obtains and caches information about
  other services, and allows clients to query and/or subscribe to that data.
  The Index Service collects service data from various resources, which it <em>publishes</em> as
  one big piece of service data. Other services can <em>query</em> for service
  data elements or <em>subscribe</em> to be notified when they change. Multiple
  indexes can be used to obtain scalability to large numbers of services and
  configure the system so that it can tolerate failures (i.e. have multiple collectors
  of data.) The Monitering Service uses the Index Service to collect and publish
  information about the current status of services.</p>
<h3>Test scripts </h3>
<p>The Monitoring Service uses <strong>test scripts</strong> to run a query
  against a service and, depending on the results, judge whether it's up or down.
  These are very simple shell scripts that can be written by system administrators
  and do not involve any configuration. They run periodically on the same machine
  as the Index Service, wrap the results of these tests in XML, and then publish
  the resulting XML in the Index Service as <em>service data</em>.</p>
<h3>Archive Service </h3>
<p>The new MDS3 <strong>Archive Service</strong> is designed to store and allow
  time-based queries on Index Service data. The Monitoring Service uses the
  Archive Service to enable historical queries about component behavior.</p>
<h3>Web Service Data Browser (WSDB) </h3>
<p>The MDS3<strong> Web Service Data Browser</strong> (WSDB) is a customizable
  display client for service data exposed by grid services. In the Monitoring
  Service, the WSDB allows users to query both the Index Service and
  the Archive Service to determine the current and past status, respectively,
  of the client's components.</p>
<h3>Trigger Service </h3>
<p>The MDS3 <strong>Trigger Service</strong> provides functionality such as an
  email gateway to let system administrators know when services fail (the email
  IDs of the recepients are generated when the XSLT is performed.) A<strong> trigger
  script</strong> may be a simple shell script or a wrapper around other applications
  such as a grid service clients or mail clients. It is configured with a set
  of Xpath conditions and, for each condition, an action to be performed when
  the condition is satisfied plus an optional XSLT stylesheet. The following
    briefly describes the Trigger Service process:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The Trigger Service subscribes to the Index Service. </li>
  <li>Each time a notification is received, the Trigger Service checks each Xpath
    condition against the service data in the email.</li>
  <li>If any condition is met, the Trigger Service runs a specified trigger script,
    with the product of the XLST transformation applied to the matching XML.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="requiredsoftware"></a>Required Software</h2>
<p>Before you can set up a Monitoring Service, you need to download the
  following software: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Globus Toolkit 3.2<br>
      <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/</a></li>
  <li>the Archive Service package <br>
    (coming soon)</li>
  <li>the Trigger Service package <br>
    (coming soon)</li>
  <li>the Web Service Data Browser <br>
      <a href="http://gtr.globus.org/article.php?story=20030723143444410">http://gtr.globus.org/article.php?story=2003072314344441</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="install"></a>Installing the Monitoring Service Package </h2>
<p>[Once the service has been packaged, need to include installation instructions.]</p>
<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up the Monitoring Service</h2>
<p>[These need to be much more specific] </p>
<p>The following table describes suggested procedures for setting up the monitoring
  framework for a typical scenario:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up an Index Service and configure it to publish data from these tests:<br>
      <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/installation/install_config_index.html">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/installation/install_config_index.html</a></li>
  <li>Set up hierarchy (Index Services aggregating other Index Services.)</li>
  <li>Set up the Archive Service (link to directions coming soon) and subscribe
    to the correct Index Service. </li>
  <li>Configure the Trigger Service with conditions and action scripts for this
    service.</li>
  <li>Write Visualizers (ESG, Archive, Details, explained below), using XSL stylesheets
    to format and display the data.</li>
  <li>Set up the WSDB and install Visualizers.<br>
