<p> The Monitoring and Discovery System (MDS) is 
the information services component of the Globus Toolkit and provides information
about the available resources on the Grid and their status. There are currently
  two available versions of MDS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MDS2 - Developed with globus toolkit 2.x, MDS2 is an LDAP-based implementation
      of information services. This component is also available in later versions
    of the Globus Toolkit (3.0 and 3.2) to support existing deployments.<br>
  </li>
  <li>MDS3 - Developed with Globus Toolkit 3.x, MDS3 is an OGSI implementation
    of information services and is available in Globus Toolkit 3.0 and 3.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently developing MDS4, a WSRF implementation of information services
  that is projected for release with Globus Toolkit 4.0.</p>
