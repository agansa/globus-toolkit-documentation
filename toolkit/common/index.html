<p> Although these components were first introduced  in GT3, the term
  &quot;common runtime components&quot; has been used beginning with GT4 to describe these
  components that provide web and pre-web services with a set of libraries and
  tools that allows these services to be platform independent, to build on various
  abstraction layers (threading, io) and to leverage functionality lower in the
  web services stack (for GT4: WSRF, WSN, etc).</p>
<p>  These components are architecturally diverse and it is thus hard to identify
  a overarching theme. Instead a few sub-themes have been identified and elaborated
  on in the <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/common/key/">GT 4.0
  Common Runtime Component Key Concepts</a>.</p>
<p>The
  following links provide consolidated information (links to downloads, docs,
  related software, etc) about the following components: </p>
