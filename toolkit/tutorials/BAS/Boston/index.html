This half-day tutorial is designed to teach developers how to build a Java service using the Globus Toolkit (GT4).  The Globus Toolkit is the flagship product of the Globus Alliance, which produces open source middleware used in building grids around the world.  The tutorial is organized as a series of exercises in which increasing functionality is added to a skeletal service implementation.  Fundamental patterns and interactions of Grid computing are highlighted.  The course is geared toward developers who want to learn about the newest work of the Globus Alliance and how to apply fundamental concepts in Grid computing.
</p>
<p>
This course is a compressed version of our standard, full-day, hands-on tutorial.  Attendees are invited to follow along with the exercises on their laptops, though tech support will be very limited due to the amount of material to be covered.
</p>
<p>
Tutorial participants who wish to follow along with the exercises must bring network-enabled laptops pre-loaded with a small set of open-source software.  Attendees must be able to run all the software listed in the prerequisites in order to participate in the hands-on exercises.
</p>
