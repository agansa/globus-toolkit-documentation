This two day event provides an in-depth introduction to the latest version of the Globus Toolkit (GT4).  The Globus Toolkit is the flagship product of the Globus Alliance, which produces open source middleware used in building grids worldwide.  The tutorials are geared toward developers who want to learn about the newest work of the Globus Alliance and how to apply fundamental concepts in Grid computing.
Conducted by experienced Globus Alliance members <a href="childers.html">Lisa Childers</a> and <a href="bacon.html">Charles Bacon</a>, this tutorial provides a solid introduction to this important technology.
</p>

<h2>September 23: Overview of Globus Toolkit 4 (GT4)</h2>

<p>
The first day of the tutorial is presentation-oriented.  It provides a comprehensive introduction to GT4, covering execution management services, data movement and management services, security services, and also reviews some of the higher-level tools that build on Globus mechanisms.</p>

<h2>September 24: How to Build a Service Using GT4</h2>

<p>The second day teaches developers how to build a Java Service that makes use
of GT4 mechanisms for state management, security, registry and related topics.  The tutorial is organized as a series of hands-on exercises in which students 
add increasing functionality to a skeletal service implementation.  Fundamental 
patterns and interactions of Grid computing are highlighted.</p>

<h3>Important Notes for Day 2</h3>
<p>Tutorial participants must bring their own network-enabled laptops pre-loaded 
with a small set of open-source software.  There will be no support available to 
debug problems with attendee laptops. A list of prerequisites for the tutorial is 
published at: <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/tutorials/BAS/Singapore/">http://www-unix.globus.org/tutorials/toolkit/BAS/Singapore/</a>.  Attendees must be 
able to run all the software listed in the prerequisites in order to participate 
in the tutorial.</p>

    </blockquote>
<p>It is the attendees' responsibility to insure that their networking, 
ant and jdk are configured and working properly prior to the tutorial.  The integrity of ant/jdk installations can be verified by building this sample code: <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~bacon/BAGS4/sample.tar.gz">Linux version</a> or <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~bacon/BAGS4/sample.zip">MS Windows version</a>.</p>
