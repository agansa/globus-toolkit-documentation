<h2>GT3 Core</h2>

<p><a name="100">Can I deploy my services into a container at run time?</a></p>

<p>We currently don't support this for persistent services. All
persistent services have to be deployed into the container when its
hosting environment is not running. Transient services (created by
factories) are however designed to be deployed at run time into a
container. Future versions may allow run time deployment of persistent
services as well.</p>

<p><a name="101">What do I have to do to make sure that my service is
activated when the container starts up?</a>

<p>When a container starts up, all its services are deactivated by
default. In order to change that behavior you need to set the property
"activateOnStartup" to "true" in the service section of your service in
the deployment descriptor. Note that activation will then take place the
first time the container is loaded. In the case of our standalone
container this happens at server startup, but in the case of a Servlet
Engine, like Tomcat, it does not happen until the servlet is loaded as
result of an invocation.</p>

<p><a name="102">Why can I only access my service running on Linux from
the local host?</a>

<p>If you do not have an entry in etc/hosts for your current IP address,
the loopback address 127.0.0.1 will be used to publish the service
handle, and thus limiting access to it to the local host. Updating the
etc/hosts file is hence recommended. You can however also specify what
DNS name should be exposed in the handle of a service by setting the
global parameter "logicalHostName" in you server-config.wsdd file in the
globalConfiguration section. See User's Guide for details.</p>

<p><a name="103">How do I make my service publish itself with a hostname
instead of an IP address?</a>

<p>In the server-config.wsdd file in the globalConfiguration section set
the parameter "publishHostName" to "true". See User's Guide for details.</p>

<p><a name="104">How do I change the ogsi logging settings in Tomcat?</a>

<p>The ogsilogging.properties file contains the log filter settings you
would need to change. This file must be in your current directory or in
the classpath in order to be correctly read by our container. When
deploying your services into Tomcat this file ends up in &lt;tomcat
dir&gt;/webapps/ogsa/WEB-INF. In order to read the settings in this file
after your modifications you need to add that directory to your
CLASSPATH variable before you start tomcat.</p>

<p><a name="105">I get a socket read timeout error during heavy load,
how can I change that behavior?</a>

<p>By default the timeout of a Grid service invocation is 60 seconds. In
order to change this behavior you have two options:

<ol>
<li>Change a property on the stub that you use to invoke the service. How
to do that is described in the following FAQ:

<ul>
<p><a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout">
http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages/JavaTimeout</a>
</ul>

<p>See our Performance Guide for more details.

<li>In you client JVM set the system property:

<pre class=command>
 -Dorg.globus.ogsa.client.timeout=(milliseconds)
</pre>

<p>To set system properties for the globus provided command line clients in
the bin directory set the OPTIONS environment variable to the full
string -Dorg....

<p>If you use version 3.0 or earlier you need to do two additional things
to enable this feature:

<ul>
<p>2.1 Download timeout handler gar from:

<ul>
<a href="ftp://ftp.globus.org/pub/gt3/3.0/3.0.0/ogsa-timeout.gar">
ftp://ftp.globus.org/pub/gt3/3.0/3.0.0/ogsa-timeout.gar</a>
</ul>

<p>and deploy it using:

<pre class=command>
 ant deploy -Dgar.name=ogsa-timeout.gar
</pre>

<p>2.2 Change the client-config.wsdd file in your distribution to contain
this handle in the requestFlow Ex:

<pre class=command>
 &lt;requestFlow&gt;
   &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.TimeOutHandler"/&gt;
   &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.RoutingRequestHandler"/&gt;
...
</pre>

<p>Make sure that your modified client-config.wsdd is either in the same
directory from where you run the client or in the classpath of the
client JVM.</p>
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>GT3 GRAM (MMJFS)</h2>
<p><a name="200">org.globus.gsi.proxy.ProxyPathValidatorException: Desired service
 path not found in policy</a>
<p>All of the "policy" based errors come from globus-grim.  This particular error
means that the /etc/grid-security/grim-port-type.xml file has not been properly
formatted.  If you copied it from step 3.2 in <a href=
"http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.0/ogsa/docs/admin/configuration.html">
the Admin Guide</a>, make sure you did not introduce any extra newlines or spaces.
The &lt;port_type&gt; entry should all be on one line.</p>
