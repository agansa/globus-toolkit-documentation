<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>The Globus Toolkit follows a release strategy similar to the one
used in the Linux kernel model.  The Globus Toolkit is released
with a version number which consists of three parts in the following
format:</p>

  <p align="center">&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;incremental&gt;</p>

<p>The <i>major</i> release number represents a major state in the Globus
Toolkit. It is incremented when the Globus Toolkit undergoes extensive
change relative to its last major release.</p>

<p>The <i>minor</i> release number represents a state in the
Globus Toolkit in which components have changed enough to create
incompatibilities yet not drastically enough to warrant another major
release.</p>

<p>The <i>incremental</i> release number changes each time a component
of the toolkit is updated. Incremental releases are generally due to
bug fixes or small enhancements and occur frequently.</p>

<h2>Stable and Development Releases</h2>

<p>There are both a stable and a development release of the Globus
Toolkit. The minor version number of a particular release is determined by
whether the release is stable or development.</p>

<p>Stable releases of the Globus Toolkit have an <i>even</i> minor version
number, while development releases of the toolkit have an <i>odd</i>
minor version number. For example,</p>

<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-2.1.1
</td>

<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-2.0.2
</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">
    globus-2.1.2
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The Globus Project only supports the latest, minor stable
release. Since there no new development in a stable release, only
bug fixes and small enhancements are given priority and attended to
promptly.</p>

<p>The development release does <i>not</i> receive the same level of
support from the Globus Project as the stable release receives. For the
development release, new features are given priority over bug fixes. Any
bugs which are fixed in a development release, however, will be ported
back to the stable release if necessary.</p>

<p>Previous stable and development releases are not supported
by the Globus Project but they will remain available in the FTP
archive.</p>
