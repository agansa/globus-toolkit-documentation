<h1>Globus
  Toolkit Downloads</h1>
<p> In production settings, users should continue to use one of the two officially
  supported stable releases (GT 3.2 remains the latest and greatest production
  release.) More information on stable and development releases can be found
at <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/versioning.html">http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/versioning.html </a></p>

<h2><a name="stable"></a>Stable Releases </h2>
<p> The Globus Alliance offers support for the last two stable releases. Support
  is provided on a best effort basis. Since no new features can be added once
  a stable release is cut, code changes on stable releases are limited to bug
fixes. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Stable distributions have an <em>even</em> minor version
  number (for example, 3.<em>2</em>.1). </p>
<p>Below are links to the latest <strong>stable</strong> versions of the Globus
    Toolkit:</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="development"></a>Development Releases</h2>
<p>Releases in the development series are used to publish new features in a timely
  manner. Unlike stable releases, feature additions
  and changes to public interfaces can happen between incremental versions of
development releases.</p>
<p> GT development releases are intended for use by early adopters: users who
  are willing to tolerate rough edges in order to use and provide feedback on
  new features. A major advantage of being an early adopter is that you can help
  shape feature development to a greater degree than is possible after a final
  release. However, development distributions may behave in unpredictable ways
and should <strong>not</strong> be used in production settings. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Development distributions have an <em>odd </em> minor
  version number (for example 3.<em>9</em>.1). </p>
