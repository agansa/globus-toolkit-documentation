<h2>Improvements/Bug Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>CRL Support for Java GSI libraries</li>
<li>Support for authorization callouts. These callouts can be used to
replace gridmap based authorization/mapping and to enforce finer
grained authorization in the GT2 GRAM component. More information can
be found <a
href="http://www-unix.globus.org/security/callouts/">here</a></li>
<li>OpenSSL has been upgraded to version 0.9.7. If you have DNs in
your grid-mapfile that contain a USERID component, you will need to
update these (see <a
href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=575">bug 575 
for details)</a></li>
<li>grid-proxy-init now checks that the certificate and the private
key match</li>
<li>CRL checking for C GSI libraries now handles the lastUpdate field and
no longer assumes that the nextUpdate field is always present, which
means that CRLs without a nextUpdate field no longer cause an error
and don't expire.</li>
<li>The SimpleCA packages are now included in the standard
distribution</li>
<li>The Globus CA setup package is now no longer part of the
distribution. Users requiring certificates for testing should take a
look at the <a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs">Globus
Certificate Service</a> or Simple CA. <b>Note
that you will not be able to run grid-cert-request until you have
installed a CA setup package</b>.</li>
<li>CA setup packages (GCS and SimpleCA) are now non-interactive.</li>
<li>grid-cert-renew has been removed from the distribution</li>
<li>For grid services specific security changes please see the <a
href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.2beta/core_notes.html">core
release notes</a></li>
<li>The <tt>grid-default-ca</tt> utility has been added to the
distribution</li> 
<li>Various minor API changes have been made (Proxy Core, Cert Utils,
System Config)</li>
<li> Fixed bugs 590, 978, 982, 1018, 1028, 1091, 1126, 1143, 1151, 1171, 1304, 1308</li>
</ul>
