    <h1>GT3 security performance evaluation</h1>

Olle Mulmo, PDC
<br>&nbsp;<h3>I have a created a small test service with GT3, and then turn on security. What do I see?</h3>

You see exactly what the people in the<a
href="http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/PEB/GTA/LCG_GTA_OGSA.htm">LCG Grid
Technology Area</a> at CERN showcased in their tests with their <a
href="http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/PEB/GTA/GTA_OGSA/DummyService/">DummyService</a>
tests: response times will increase by a factor 10. In addtion, it
takes 5 seconds or more to interact with the service factory and
create a new service.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>5 seconds? Surely, this can't be?</h3>

<p>
The short answer is unfortunately yes. There are many factors that
contribute though: I have found several of them and will try to
explain what I have found as thoroughly as possible.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Actual timings don't mean a thing as they only apply to
the computer you run on. Below, you will find the timings I measured
on my instrumented GT3 installation running on my particular hardware
with my particular version of the JVM.
The important thing to remember from the figures are their <i>RELATIVE</i> sizes.
<p>
Timings are denoted in milliseconds throughout this document. Prefixes <code>K</code>
and <code>M</code> denote <i>kibi</i> and <i>mibi</i>, not <i>kilo</i> and <i>mega</i>.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>So the service creation takes several seconds? It must be an overly complex operation?</h3>

  Actually, the service creation process itself takes about 50 msec. It's neglible.
<p>
  What hits you and accounts for the many seconds is the
  initialization of the underlying tooling in your client:
  initializing the Axis handlers and the XML security libraries
  account for the major part of this time.
<p>
  In addition, there are many other one-time operations happening,
  such as initializing the secure random number generator, loading the
  proxy certificate and your trusted CA certificates from disk,
  loading the WSDL defining the factory service porttype, and finally
  establish a security context with the server when using
  GSI-SecureConversation (which you tend to do). None of this is
  performed if you were to create a second service instance in the
  same security context.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>OK, but there's still a factor 10 penalty on my method
invocations regardless of this. Is it the complicated and expensive
crypto operations, perhaps?</h3>

  What I tried to showcase (but failed miserably) in an earlier email
  was that the XML security implementation is broken in that it is
  generating a huge overhead: parsing the surrounding XML is 2-3 times
  more expensive than the crypto operation itself.
<p>
  The DummyService tests make use of HMAC, a lightweight form of
  creating a digital signature to ensure message integrity. Another
  alternative is full-blown encryption. The table below displays
  characteristics for both. The case of no encryption (plain) is shown
  as well.
<center>

</table>
</center>
<ul>
<li><code>SOAPsize</code> is the average size of request/response
messages for an <code>Service.echo(Payload)</code> operation: the
incoming and outgoing messages differ by only 50-60 bytes. Encrypted
data gets Base64-encoded which increases the the wire message sizes by
33%.<br>&nbsp;

<li><code>T(engine)</code> is the time spent in the Axis engine itself
on the <i>server</i>. Time spent (de-)serializing the SOAP messages
and doing the HTTP transfer is <i>NOT</i> included, but can be derived
from the roundtrip time.<br>&nbsp;

<li><code>T(roundtrip)</code> is the total roundtrip time, measured on the client side.<br>&nbsp;

<li>The <code>Encr</code> and <code>HMAC</code> timings do NOT include the time for establishing
  a shared security context between client and server (GSI-SecureConversation).
</ul>
  To summarize, we do see a performance hit when using the XML security library, but it's
  far from a factor 10.


<br>&nbsp;<h3>How can you say that? Clearly, I see figures differing by more than a factor 10 in that table!</h3>

 Yes, but remember that the load on the client is the same as the load on
  the server! If you look at the size-16 case for, you get a penalty of 40
  msec on both ends in the HMAC case. The enveloping of the encrypted or
  signed data enlarges the message size, but I wouldn't attribute too much
  of the overhead to slower network transfer and XML (de-)serializing.
<p>
  I think this is where the DummyService tests made were <b>WRONG</b>: they put
  many clients on the same machine, expecting to create a huge load on
  the server. In fact, the load on the client machine was just as high,
  and this may attribute to the fact that the CPU utilization on the
  server was not 100% when it reached "max".
<p>
  Notice also that the poor implementation of XML security hits you
  4-fold on the roundtrip time, as you need to encrypt and decrypt on
  both client and server side, in sequence. Thus, for every msec of
  overhead that we can save by improving the implementation of this
  library, we will gain 4.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>But these figures are still in the millisecond range: how do you attribute my
factor of 10 slowdown?</h3>

 The table does not include the overhead for establishing a shared secret
  used to encrypt the data, and this is what hits you.
<p>
  The handshake between the client and the server is an exchange of 3
  roundtrip messages in total. In my case, the size of the SOAP messages
  sent were {request,response}:<br>&nbsp;
 <center>
    <code>{787,3275} {2606,787} {670,686}</code>
 </center><br>
  This sequence of messages takes roughly 150 msec to complete.  
<p>
  <b>BUT</b>, this is for establishing a context only. In the
  DummyService case, the client performs a <b>credential delegation</b> to the
  service instance as well; This costs an additional roundtrip. The exchange
  pattern and corresponding messages sizes in my case were:<br>&nbsp;
   <center>
     <code>{787,3275} {2606,787} {670,1131} {1322,686}</code>
   </center>
<p>
  A handshake with delegation implies much more work for the involved
  parties as it involves the creation and validation of a RSA key
  pair: the four roundtrips takes roughly 400 msec to complete.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>But I already had my secure context established -- I did
that when talking to the factory!</h3>

 No: you establish a new context for each new port type reference that you make use of.
<p>
 In the case of the secure DummyService client <a href="http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/PEB/GTA/GTA_OGSA/DummyService/summary3/DummyClientThread.java">(source code)</a>, this means the following message pattern:
<ul>
<li><b>Factory:</b>
<ul><li>Establish context with DummyServiceFactory port type
    <li>invoke <code>create()</code>
</ul>
<li><b>Service:</b>
<ul><li>Establish context with Dummy port type, perform delegation
    <li>invoke <code>echo()</code>
    <li>invoke <code>getTime()</code><br>&nbsp;
    <li>invoke <code>destroy()</code> on GridService port type
</ul>
</ul>

  In total, this results in 4 roundtrips in the non-secure case (the
  lines that start with 'invoke'), and an additional 7 to in the
  secure case, totalling 11 roundtrips.
<p>
  Notice the <b>BUG</b> in the client program: the service instance is
  destroyed without any security! Furthermore, since the DummyService
  does not extend the GridService port type, the client needs to grabs
  a new reference to a GridService port type from the same service
  locator. The new reference would need 3 additional roundtrips in
  order to establish a new security context with this new port type,
  before invoking <code>destroy()</code>.  (One can argue heavily that
  all this is nothing but a good example of stupid shortcomings in the
  tooling.)

<br>&nbsp;<h3>Huh? I thought I would understand more by reading all this?</h3>

  The following is a bit misleading and wrong, but makes for a good
  conceptual summary of what happens: When using security, you get a
  factor-3 performance penalty when you invoke a single message.
  Furthermore, you invoke 3 times as many messages: multiply them
  together, and you have your slowdown of a factor-10.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>Anything else?</h3>

  Clearly, the tooling does not handle the simple use case very
  well. The initialization overheads are way off the chart, and
  invoking a single method securely increases the overhead by a factor
  10.
<p>
  The tooling works much better in scenarios where initialization cost
  is neglible, for instance when you perform hundreds of invocations
  using the same security context: The overhead can then be measured
  in additional 10ths of milliseconds for small payloads.
<p>
  On a related note, Java Hotspot works quite well on GT3: while performing
  hundreds of invocations on the same service instance, you will gradually
  see improvements on both client and server side that eventually cut as
  much as 40% of the roundtrip time.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>Conclusions?</h3>
 
  Not really. Clearly, we need a solution for the invoke-once-then-die
  usage scenario which the current tooling is simply not built for. It
  will need some serious thinking on how you can go about to fix this.
<p>
  In the meanwhile, I suggest we concentrate us on the XML security
  library and its duplicate parsing and internal use of XPath queries:
  any millisecond saved there will cut the roundtrip time by 4.

<h3> Notes: </h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Security costs:</h3>

Using of SSL imposes a performance penality. To place the above
security ananylsis in context, the following numbers, taken from this
<a
href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/servers/security/axl600l/questionsanswers.html#bn1">webpage</a>,
give an indication of how a server performs when insecure and secure
connections are made to it. No SSL accelarators were used for these
numbers.

<pre><i>A study by Networkshop showed a Pentium server with Linux and Apache
supporting 322 unsecured sessions, when SSL was turned on; the
connects per second decreased to 2.4. </i></pre>

<li><h3>GT3 Security Code:</h3>

One of the issues that was apparent in profiling GT3 security code,
 the conversion from Axis representation to DOM flagged as expensive
 operation. In the Axis 1.2 release, the SOAP API will implement the
 DOM API and hence the conversion will not be required.

<li><h3>Apache XML Security Libary: </h3>
<ul>
<li> The library has initialization code which reads the configuration
file and parses it. This is quite expensive, but is invoked once per
JVM. This affects the client side the most, since it is a good
percentage of the round trip time.

<li> XPath queries on the configuration files (appear to) have been reworked.

<li>In case of GSI Secure conversation with encryption, an XPath query
has been eliminated, so should improve performance.

<li>In case of GSI Secure conversation, the optimizations have been
added to reduce size of the context.

</ul>

<li><h3>Security Mechanisms:</h3> 

<p>GSI Secure Conversation, especially when used with delegation, is
an expensive operation. It is recommended that this mechanism not be
used unless delegation is required. 

<p> For all operations not requiring delegation, GSI Secure Message
would be an option which has lesser performance penalities. This
currently has only integity (signature) option.
