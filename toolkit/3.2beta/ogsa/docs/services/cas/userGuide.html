<a name="using">Using the Community Authorization Service
</a>
</h2>

<p>
A typical CAS user will use only two CAS-specific commands:
<i>cas-proxy-init</i>, which contacts a CAS server and obtains a
credential, and <i>cas-wrap</i>, which wraps a grid-enabled client
program, causing that client program to use the credential that was
previously generated using <i>cas-proxy-init</i>. For example, a day
in the life of a CAS user might look something like this:
</p>
1. In the morning, the user runs:
</p>
<pre>
        % grid-proxy-init
        % cas-proxy-init -t <i>tag</i>
</pre>

<p>
The first line generates a Globus proxy credential; the second uses
that credential to contact the CAS server and retrieve a CAS
credential that includes all the permissions granted to the user by
the community. The <i>tag</i> argument can be any string and is used
to assign a name for that credential (<i>cas-wrap</i> uses this name
to locate the credential).
</p>

<p>
2.Several times throughout the day, the user runs commands that look
like:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t <i>tag grid-enabled-program args</i>
</pre>

<p>
This runs the program <i>grid-enabled-program</i> with arguments
<i>args</i>, using the CAS credential that had been created by and
assigned the name <i>tag</i>. For example:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t my-community gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>
<p>
looks for a CAS credential with the name "my-community" (e.g., a
credential that had been created using "cas-proxy-init -t
my-community") and then runs the command "gsincftp myhost.edu",
causing the gsincftp program to use that CAS credential to
authenticate.
</p>
<p>
3. At the end of the day, the user runs:
</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t <i>tag</i> grid-proxy-destroy
</pre>
<p>
to destroy the CAS credential, and:
</p>
<pre>
        % grid-proxy-destroy
</pre>
<p>
to destroy the Globus proxy credential.Or the user might simply let both
credentials expire.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>
<a name="cas-proxy-init">
Generating CAS credentials: <i>cas-proxy-init</i>
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The syntax of the <i>cas-proxy-init</i> program is:
</p>

<pre>
        cas-proxy-init [<i>options</i>] [ -t <i>tag</i> | -p <i>proxyfile</i> ]<o:p></o:p>
</pre>

<p>
This program contacts the CAS server, obtains a credential, and places
that credential into a file. If "-p <i>proxyfile</i>" is used, then
the credential is placed in the file named <i>proxyfile</i>; if "-t
<i>tag</i>" is used, then cas-proxy-init chooses a filename based on
the value of <i>tag</i>. 

<p> A environment variable, GLOBUS_LOCATION needs to be set to point
to the GT3 install location. If CAS clients have been deployed, then
this script is placed in GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to
be added to the PATH for it to be executed from other locations.

</p>

<p>
The other options that can be used with <i>cas-proxy-init</i> are:
</p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width=127 valign=top>
  <p><b>-c</b> <i>url</i></p>
  </td>
  <td width=463 valign=top>
  <p>Contact URL for the CAS server. This typically looks like, 
  <pre>
    http://<i>GT3Host</i>:<i>GT3Port</i>/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService
  </pre> 
  where <i>GT3Host</i> and <i>GT3Port</i> are host and port where
  container with CAS service is running.
   </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
  <p><b>-s</b> <i>server_identity</i></p>
  </td>
  <td valign=top>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>When doing mutual authentication with the CAS server,
  expect <i>server_identity</i> as the remote identity.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
  <p ><b>-f</b> <i>policy_file</i></p>
  </td>
  <td valign=top>
  <p>Generate a CAS credential that includes only those permissions
specified in file <i>policy_file</i> (the default is to generate a
credential with all the user’s permissions).</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
  <p><b>-l</b> <i>hours</i></p>
  </td>
  <td valign=top>
  <p>Generate a credential that will time out after <i>hours</i>
  hours. This is a request for lifetime, but the CAS server may
  have a set maximum for the assertion lifetime which will be
  enforced.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>The <i>cas-proxy-init</i> program also consults environment
variables to determine the appropriate URL to connect to and server
identity to expect.The URL is determined using this algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-c</b> option was specified, use the URL specified with
that option is used.</li>

<li>Otherwise, if the <b>CAS_SERVER_URL</b> environment variable is
set, use the value of that variable as the URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The server identity is determined in a similar fashion:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>-s</b> option was specified, use the identity
specified with that option</li>

<li>Otherwise, if the <b>CAS_SERVER_IDENTITY</b> environment variable
is set, use the value of that variable as the expected server
identity.</li>

<li>If neither is set, host authorization is done and the
expected server credential is <i>cas/<fqdn></i>, where <fqdn> is the
fully qualified domain name of the host on which the CAS service is
up.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Getting specific CAS rights</h3>

<p>It is possible to request specific permissions from the CAS server
using the <b>-f</b> option. This option causes <i>cas-proxy-init</i>
to read a set of requested rights from a file.</p>

<p>This file should contain one or more resource identifiers:</p>

<pre>
        Resource: <i>ResourceNamesapce</i>|<i>ResourceName </i></p>
</pre>

<p>For each resource, one or more actions identifers:</p>

<pre>
        <i>serviceType action </i>
</pre>
<p>For example, if the client needed assertions for
&quot;file/read&quot; service/action for resource
&quot;ftp://sample.org&quot; and &quot;ftp://sample3.org&quot;, both
in &quot;FTPNamespace&quot; and &quot;directory/read&quot; and
&quot;directory/write&quot; permissions on the former resource only,
the policy file should have the following entries:</p>

<pre>
        Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org
        file read
        directory read
        directory write
        Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample3.org
        file read
</pre>

<p> To indicate any resource, the following wildcard notation should
be used.
<pre>uri:samlResourceWildcard</pre>


<p> To indicate any action, the following wildcard notation for
serviceType and action should be used. Note that this should be the
first (and clearly the only action) in the list of action
specified. All other actions in the list are ignored and if it is not
the first, it is not treated as wildcard.
<pre>uri:samlActionNSWildcard uri:samlActionWildcard</pre>

<p>For example, if the client needs assertions for all resources and
all actions the policy file should look like.

<pre>
       Resource: uri:samlResourceWildcard
       uri:samlActionNSWildcard uri:samlActionWildcard
</pre>

<p>If the client needs assertions for all actions on resource
&quot;FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org&quot;, the policy file should be
as follows

<pre>
       Resource: FTPNamespace|ftp://sample1.org
       uri:samlActionNSWildcard uri:samlActionWildcard
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="cas-wrap">
Using CAS credentials: <i>cas-wrap</i>
</a>
</h2>

<p>The <i>cas-wrap</i> program runs a grid-enabled program, causing it
to use previously-generated CAS credentials.Its syntax is:</p>

<pre>
        cas-wrap [-t <i>tag</i> | -p<i> proxyfile </i>] <i>command args</i>
</pre>

<p>Both versions of this command run:</p>

<pre>
        <i>command args</i>
</pre>

<p>in an environment in which command will use a previously-generated
CAS credential.The first form should be used if <i>cas-proxy-init</i>
was run with a <i>tag</i> argument; for example,</p>

<p> A environment variable, GLOBUS_LOCATION needs to be set to point
to the GT3 install location. If CAS clients have been deployed, then
this script is placed in GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to
be added to the PATH for it to be executed from other locations.

<pre>
        % cas-wrap -t my-community gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>

<p>will look for a credential generated by a previous
execution of:</p>

<pre>
        % cas-proxy-init -t my-community
</pre>

<p>and then set the environment to use that credential while
running the command</p>

<pre>
        % gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>

<p>The second form should be used if <i>cas-proxy-init </i>was
run with the <b>–o</b> option; for example,</p>

<pre>
        % cas-wrap –p /path/to/my/cas/credential gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>

<p>will look for a credential generated by a previous
execution of:</p>

<pre>
        % cas-proxy-init –o /path/to/my/cas/credential
</pre>

<p>and then set the environment to use that credential while
running the command</p>

<pre>
        % gsincftp myhost.edu
</pre>

<p>Most grid-enabled programs (specifically, most programs written
using the Globus GSI libraries) will honor the environment variable
<b>X509_USER_PROXY</b>; if this variable is set, they will use its
value as the name of a file containing the proxy credential to use
when authenticating.A user could, for example, cause the gsincftp
program to use CAS credentials by running these two commands:</p>

<pre>
        % setenv X509_USER_PROXY /path/to/my/cas/credential
</pre>

<p>The <i>cas-wrap</i> utility program works by running the specified
command in an environment in which that variable is set.</p>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="cas-sd"> CAS Service Data </a> </h2>
The CAS service exposes two strings as service data and is within the
following namesapce <i>http://ogsa.globus.org/base/cas</i>. These are
constants that are set at the service start up and cannot be modified.
<p>
<ul>
 <li><i>ServerDN</i>: This is the DN of the credentials used by the CAS server.
 <li><i>VODescription</i>: This is a short description of the VO in
 which the CAS server is running.
</ul>

<p> There are scripts in the GT3 install to run get the values for the
above said service data, <i>ogsi-find-service-data</i> in
GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. For more detailed instructions refer to the <a
href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.0/ogsa/docs/users_guide.html">User's
Guide</a> in GT3.

<p> An example run of the command line client to get the value of the
service data value of the server DN is shown below. The query was run
against a GT3 container running on localhost and port number 8080 from
GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin.

<h2> <a name="cas-client"> Writing CAS Clients </a> </h2>

<p>Listed below are some helper methods in the client package that
maybe used for writing clients for the CAS service. Refer to code
and/or Java Docs for more information.

<ul>
<li> <b> Getting handle to CAS service port type</b>

<p> org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.client.CasClientSetup is used.

<p> Code:</p>
<ul>
<li> To get a handle to CAS service with instance URL,
<i>instanceURL</i> and identity <i>serviceIdentity</i>, 

<pre> CasClientSetup clientSetup = new CasClientSetup();
 CommunityAuthorizationServicePortType casPort = 
	    clientSetup.getCASPort(instanceURL, serverIdentity);
</pre>

<li> To get a handle to CAS service with instance URL,
<i>instanceURL</i> and use host authorization, 

<pre> CasClientSetup clientSetup = new CasClientSetup();
 CommunityAuthorizationServicePortType casPort = 
	    clientSetup.getCASPort(instanceURL);
<pre>
</ul>

<li> <b> Generating proxy with CAS assertions embedded </b>

<p> API in class org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.client.CasProxyHelper
can be used to generate a proxy with CAS assertions embedded. To pass
in relevant parameters, class
org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.client.ClientParams is used. The
datatype, org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.client.ResourceActionsMap is
used to represent the resource/actions mapping for which assertions
are requested on.

<p> Listed below are steps to use the
API. org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.client.CasProxyInit has sample code
that generates a proxy embedded with CAS assertions.

<p> Code:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<p>ClientParams class is used to construct the parameter. If the
default constructor is used and none of the values are set, requested
assertion lifetime is set to 24 hours, default proxy file is used, the
proxy with assertions embedded is named with a &quot;.cas&quot; tag at
the end of proxy file.

<pre> ClientParams clientParams = new ClientParams();</pre>

<li> Sets assertion lifetime. If not set, 24 hours is used.

<pre>
 clientParams.setAssertionLifetime(lifetime);
</pre>

<li> Sets file name of the proxy to use. If not set, defualt credential is used..
<pre>
 clientParams.setProxyFileName(proxyFilename);
</pre>

<li> Sets file name of the proxy with CAS assertions to be written
to. If not set, original proxy file name is appended with a tag.
<pre>
 clientParams.setCasProxyFileName(casProxyFilename);
</pre>

<li> Sets tag to append to original proxy filename. If not set, the
tag &quotcas&quot is used. The tag is used if a filename for assertion
embedded proxy is not set.
<pre>
 clientParams.setCasProxyTag(tag);
</pre>
<li> Sets the resource/actions for which assertion is requested on. It
uses an array of data type <i>ResourceActionsMap</i> (explained below)
<pre>
 clientParams.setResourceActionsMap(resActions);
</pre>

<li> <i>ResouceActionsMap</i> datatype is used to represent the
resource and the actions on the resource for which the permissions are
required. It has a String to represent resource and a vector of string
sto represent the actions.

<p> The resource should be of the form,
&quot;<i>objectNamespace</i>|<i>objectName</i>&quot;. The action
should be of the form, &quot;<i>serviceType actionName</i>&quot;

<li> Instance of Helper class:
<pre>
 CasProxyHelper casProxyHelper = new CasProxyHelper(instanceURL, serverIdentity);
</pre>
where, 
<ul>
 <li> <i/>instanceURL</i> is the URL to contact CAS service.<br>
 <li> <i>serverIdentity</i> is the expected identity of the server. If null,
      host authorization is used.
</ul>

<li> Generating proxy with CAS assertions

<pre>
 String casProxyFilename = casProxyHelper.getCasProxy(clientParams);
</pre>

This methods contacts the CAS service, retrieves assertions, embeds in
credetial and returns the path to the proxy file with CAS proxy
embedded.

</ol>
</ul>
