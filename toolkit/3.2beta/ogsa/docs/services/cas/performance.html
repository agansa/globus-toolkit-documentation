<h3> Summary of performance tests </h3>

<ul>
<li> Basic query test - <i>whoami</i> 
<li> Query test - <i>findPolicyData</i>
<li> Credential test - <i>getMaximalAssertion</i>
<li> Size of credential test
</ul>

<p> Each of the first three tests were done once with 200 clients
talking to the server serially and then with all them talking to the
server concurrently. Each number is an average of the time taken to
get a locator and handle to the CASPort and the actual method
invocation. All numbers are in milliseconds.

<p> The stress test framework in GT3 Core was used for testing. This
framework allows a block of code defined in an "init" method for
initializing, code to be timed in "run" method and finally a "postRun"
methd. Two of the numbers the stress framework that are of relevance
here are

<ul>

<li>"totalAverageTime" - this is the average time that each
performance run takes (initialization, run and postRun). In the table
below, these are the numbers given outside the bracket. (appears to be
weird in concurent case since it does not account for the large time
each thread takes).
<li>"totalCallAverageTime" - this is the average time that each run of the
relevant code takes (run). In the table below, these are the numbers
given inside the bracket. In concurent runs, the time taken are very
high.But look at end of this document to see what infrastructure
contributes.)  </ul>

<p>The server and client were run on the same machine. Database
(PostGres) was used and was also on the same machine.

<h3> Platform </h3>

All tests were run on a i686, 2.2GHz machine running Linux 2.4.18.

<h3> Database status </h3>

<p>All tests were run with two different sets of data in the backend
database. But in both cases the default bootstrap was done which
populated the database with service/action implict to CAS service.

<p> In the case of smaller data set, other than the data described
above, a single trust anchor, usergroup, user and object was
added. Two policies were added - one granting that user group super
user permissions on the CAS server and another granting it access to
the external object added. (only the latter is returned on an
assertion generation request.)

<p> In the other case, 100 user groups, 100 users, 100 resources and
1000 polices was added above the deafult data. Each user group was
given ten polices across the resources.

<h3> Test results </h3>
<ul>
<li> <h4>Basic query test </h4>

<p> This test measures the time taken to query the database to get the
CAS nickname of the user making the call. There are no parameters to
process in this call and is the most rudimentary query in the CAS
service. Every single CAS invocation does this to get the name of the
user to ascertain permissiosns. 

<p> The test was run with 200 client threads, serially and cocurrently.

<table border="1" width="30%">
<tr><td></td><td>Serial</td><td></td><td>Concurrent</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td></td><td>253 (253)</td><td></td><td>155(26832)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td></td><td>253(253)</td><td></td><td>214(40958)</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<li> <h4>Query test </h4>

<p> This test measures the time taken to query the database to get all
applicable policy for the user making the call. The CAS server checks
permissions for the operation and performs the actual retrieval of
policy and is returned as an array of PolicyData objects.

<p> The test was run with 200 client threads, serially and
cocurrently. With smaller data set only one policy is returned, with
larger dataset 10 amongst the 1000 policies are returned. 

<table border="1">
<tr><td><td>Serial<td><td>Concurrent<td></tr>
<tr><td>Small<td><td>315(315)<td><td>219(34425)<td></tr>
<tr><td>Large<td><td>479(479)<td><td>286(40298)<td></tr>
</table>

<li> <h4> Credential test </h4>

<p> This test measures the time taken to query the database to get all
applicable assertions for the user making the invocation. The CAS
server checks permissions for the operation and performs the actual
retrieval of assertion. Since the assertion is returned as xsd:any the
time taken to convert them in SAMLAssertion object is also measure.

<p> The test was run with 200 client threads, serially and
cocurrently. With smaller data set assertion contains only one
authorizatin policy , with larger dataset 10 polices amongst the 1000
policies are embedded in the assertion.

<table border="1">
<tr><td><td>Serial<td><td>Concurrent<td></tr>
<tr><td>Small<td><td>416(416)<td><td>303(50032)<td></tr>
<tr><td>Large<td><td>568(568)<td><td>400(52304)<td></tr>
</table>

<li> <h4> Size of credential test </h4>

The database was populated appropraitely to generate credentials of
various sizes and saved to file. The largest credential size tested
was approximately 70K. This required that the default timeout in the
Stub be incresed to allow for large call time. 

<p>For credendial of size 70995, using 50 threads serially, the
avarage timetaken was 6833ms.

</ul>

<h3> Running performance tests </h3>

All the classes needed to run these tests are in the package
<i>org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.server.test.performance</i> and
targets have been provided in the build file for running them.

<h5> Setting up database </h5>

<p> These targets add some specific number of users to the
database. One of the users needs to have the subect DN of the
credential that will be used while running the tests. This is picked
up from a variable "subject1DN" from a file, whose name is passes as a
system property to each of this target. But default, this is set to
"casTestProperties". To override it, set <i>-Dcas.test.properties</i>
while invoking the target.

<p> To get configuration parameters for database access, a file with
database information is required as shown <a
href="installGuide.html#dbConfig">here</a>. This is by default,
"casDBProperties". To override it, set <i>-Dcas.db.properties</i>
while invoking the target.

<p> To set up small datasets in database, the following from CAS_HOME

<pre>  psql -U tester -d casDatabase -f etc/delete.sql<br>
       ant bootstrap<br>
       ant populateDB -Dargs="small"
</pre>

<p> To set up large datasets, but credential size less than 50K, in
database, the following from CAS_HOME

<pre>  psql -U tester -d casDatabase -f etc/delete.sql<br>
       ant bootstrap<br>
       ant populateDB -Dargs="large"
</pre>

<p> To set up large datasets, but credential size greater than 50K, in
database, the following from CAS_HOME

<pre>  psql -U tester -d casDatabase -f etc/delete.sql<br>
       ant bootstrap<br>
       ant populateDB -Dargs="large largeCred"
</pre>

<a name="gt3Cont"><h5> Setting up GT3 container </h5></a>

For large runs (greater than 200 clients) and/or large credential
generation(greater than 50K), the default timout on the Stub needs to
be altered. This can be done by editing the GLOBUS_LOCATION/build.xml,
<i>stress</i> target and adding the following as another system
property. The value needs to be set appropriately.

<pre>
	&lt;sysproperty key="org.globus.ogsa.client.timeout" value="200000"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The above is the solution if "Read timeout error" is seen on the
client side.  In all other cases, a default GT3 container with CAS
service deployed should suffice.

<h5> Running test targets </h5>

All tests use the stress framework in GT3 core. For more details,
refer to test documentation in GT3 distribution.

All targets have the following options:

<ul>
<li>-Dstress.threads = number of threads
<li>-Dstress.processes = number of processes<br>
<li>-Dstress.concurrent = set to "yes" or "no"
</ul>

In each case the output is dumped as XML file in the directory from
which the test is run.

<ul>
<li> <h5>Basic Query tests</h5>

Running the following target after setting up the database and GT3
container runs a test that measures time taken for a call to get the
CAS nickname of the user.

<pre>
 ant basicQueryStress -Dstress.threads=300 -Dstress.processes=1 -Dstress.concurrent=yes </pre>

<li> <h5>Query tests</h5>

Running the following target after setting up the database and GT3
container runs a test that measures time taken for getting all
applicable policies of the user.

<pre>
ant queryStress -Dstress.threads=300 -Dstress.processes=1 -Dstress.concurrent=no
</pre>

<li> <h5>Credential tests</h5>

Running the following target after setting up the database and GT3
container runs a test that measures time taken for generating
credential of all policies of user.

<pre>
 ant credentialStress -Dstress.threads=200 -Dstress.processes=1 -Dstress.concurrent=yes </pre>

<li> <h5>Size of Credential</h5>

This test is used to ensure that credentials of large sizes can be
generated. To run this test, set up the data base using the
"populateDB" target with options "large largeCred". This will ensure
that the credential returned on running the following is around
70K. This test requires that the timeout be set to a high value as
descibed <a href="#gt3Cont">here</a>. Since this is a test of large
credential generation, it maybe prudent to just have one or few threads
execution, rather than many.

<pre>
 ant credentialStress -Dstress.threads=1 -Dstress.processes=1 -Dstress.concurrent=no </pre>
</ul>

<hr>

Infrasture overhead test <br>

<p> The <i>whoami</i> method on CAS port was overridden to just return
a dummy string without any processing. The above described "Basic
Query Test" was done to measure performance with 200 serial and
concurrent client. On serial testing, time taken was 252ms (252) and
on concurrent testing it was 187ms (34209). So it appears that
irrespective of the application code, the infrastructure takes a
considerably long time on concurrent calls.
