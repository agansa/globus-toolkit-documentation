</ul>

The CAS administrator clients can be used to manipulate and maintain
the data in CAS database. It allows one to enroll (and unenroll) CAS
Objects, create (and delete) groups, add (and remove) members from
groups, add (and remove) service type and action mappings. Typically
these operation are performed by the CAS Administrator.
<p>
All enroll operations involve granting cas/grantAll permission on the
enrolled object to some user group (to which the user may belong to or
otherwise).
<p>
All operations require that the user have specific permissions to
perform the operation. Permissions and policies are given and applied
to user groups. Hence a user is said to have permission to perform an
operation if one of the user groups that the user belongs to has
permission to perform that operation.
<p>
If some user group to which the user belongs to, has permission
"superuser" on cas server object, then they may perform any operation,
even if they donot have specific rights that are outlined below for
each operation.
<p>
If a user has cas/grantAll permission on any object, then the user is
permitted to perform any operations on that object.
<p> 
The CAS Query commands donot alter the state of the database and
any CAS user who has cas/query permissions may use the commands to
retrieve data from the CAS server.

<p>
Scripts have been provided for all command line clients. The scripts
are placed in GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. This directory needs to be added to
the PATH to be able to execute these scripts from other location. An
environment variable <i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i> must be set to point to
GT3 Install Location. Some of the options that are common to all the
clients are described here.

<h5><a name="client-options">Client Options:</a></h5>

The options that are common to all clients are

<pre> [-debug -help -v -c cas-url -s server-identity] </pre>
<ul>

<li><b>CAS Service URL: </b>The <i><b>-c cas-url</b></i> option can
be used to set CAS Service instance, where <i>cas-url</i> is the URL
of the CAS service instance.  Optionally, an environment varaible
<i>CAS_SERVER_URL</i> may be set to point to the URL. The <i>-c</i> flag takes precedence between the two.

The instance URL typically looks like
<pre>
  http://<i>GT3Host</i>:<i>GT3Port</i>/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService
</pre> 

where <i>GT3Host</i> and <i>GT3Port</i> are host and port where
container with CAS service is running.

<li><b>CAS Service Identity: </b>The <i><b>-s server-identity</b></i>
option can be used to set the expected CAS server identity, where
<i>server-identity</i> is the identity of the CAS service. Optionally,
an environment variable <i>CAS_SERVER_IDENTITY</i> may be set to point
to the expected server identity. The <i>-s</i> flag takes
precedence. <br> If neither is set, host authorization is done and the
expected server credential is <i>cas/&lt;fqdn&gt;</i>, where &lt;fqdn&gt; is the
fully qualified domain name of the host on which the CAS service is
up.

<li><b>Debug: </b>To run the client with debug message traces and
error stack traces, <i><b>-debug</b></i> flag must be used

<li><b>Usage: </b>The <i><b>-help</b></i> flag prints the usage message for the
client.

<li><b>Version number: </b>The <i><b>-v</b></i> flag prints the version number.
</ul>

Note: If you have a asterix (*) in your command, you might have to
escapeit with backslash.

<h3>Enrolling and Unenrolling Trust Anchors</h3>
<p>
To enroll a trust anchor, the user must have cas/enroll_trustAnchor
permission on that cas server object(that is, must have permission to
perform the enroll_trustAnchor action on the cas service type).  The
enroll operation allows the user to choose a user group to which
cas/grantAll permission on the enrolled object should be granted. The
nickname should be unique across the CAS database and is used to refer
to this trust anchor.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-enroll [<i>options</i>] trustAnchor <i>userGpName</i> <i>nickname</i> <i>authMethod</i> <i>authData</i>

</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission
                  should be granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>nickname   : trust anchor nickname
  <li>authMethod : authentication method used by the trust anchor
  <li>authData   : data used for authentication, typically the DN
</ul>

To unenroll a trust anchor, the user must have cas/unenroll permission
on that trust anchor.  The trust anchor must also be unused, that is
there may not be any users in the database that have this trust
anchor or it may not be a part of any object group.

<p>

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-remove [<i>options</i>] trustAnchor <i>nickname</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>nickname   : nickname of the trust anchor to be unenrolled
</ul>

If the trust anchor nickname specified does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all
policy data on that trust anchor is purged.
<p>

<h3>Enrolling and Unenrolling Users</h3>
<p>
To enroll a user, the user must have cas/enroll_user permission (that
is, must have permission to perform the enroll_user action on the cas
service type).  The enroll operation allows the user to choose a user
group to which cas/grantAll permission on the enrolled object should
be granted. The enrolled user also gets all the privileges granted to
the community. The nickname should be unique across the CAS database
and is used to refer to this user.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-enroll [<i>options</i>] user <i>userGpName</i> <i>nickname</i> <i>subjectName</i> <i>trustAnchorNick</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be 
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>nickname   : user nickname 
  <li>subjectName: subject name from the user's credentails.
  <li>trustAnchorNick: Name of the user's trust anchor. 
		 (Must exist in the CAS database)
</ul>

To unenroll a user, the user must have cas/unenroll permission on that
user.  The user must also be unused, that is, there may not be any
user groups in the database that have this user as a member.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-remove [<i>options</i>] 
	  user <i>nickname</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>nickname   : nickname of the user to be unenrolled
</ul>

If the user nickname specified does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all
policy data on that user is purged.
<p>
<h3>Enrolling and Unenrolling Namespaces</h3>
<p>
To enroll a namespace, the user must have cas/enroll_namespace
permission (that is, must have permission to perform the
enroll_namespace action on the cas service type).  The enroll
operation allows the user to choose a userGroup to have cas/grantAll
permission on the enrolled object. The comparison algorithm specified
should be the name of the Comparison class that needs to be used to
compare objects that belong to this namespace. The nickname should be
unique across the CAS database and is used to refer to this user.

<pre>
casAdmin$ cas-enroll [<i>options</i>] namespace <i>userGpName</i> <i>nickname</i> <i>basename</i> <i>comparisonAlg</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>nickname   : namespace nickname 
  <li>basename   : base URL for the name space
  <li>comparisonAlg : Comparison algorithm to be used. Unless the standard
	      comparison algorithms described below are used, the
	      fully qualified name of the class that needs to be used
	      should be given. The class needs to extend from the
	      abstract class
	      org.globus.ogsa.impl.base.cas.server.ObjectComparison.
</ul>

The two comparison classes provided as a part of the distribution are

<ul>
  <li>ExactComparison : This class does a case-sensitive exact comparison
of the object names. If comparisonAlg in the above method is set to
"ExactComparison", the class in the distribution is loaded and used.

  <li>WildcardComparison: This class does wild card matching as described
in "CAS Simple Policy Language". (FIXME link to that doc) It assumes
that the wild card character is "*" and "/" is file separator. If
comparisonAlg in the above method is set to "WildCardComparison", the
class in the distribution is loaded and used. 
</ul>

<p> Also two namespaces are added to the CAS database at bootup time,
other than the inherent CAS Namespace.

<ul>
 <li>FTPDirectoryTree : Uses the WildCardComparison Algorithm and has
                         the base URL set to current directory.
 <li>FTPExact : Uses the ExactComparison Algorithm and has the base
                URL set to current directory.
</ul>

To unenroll a namespace, the user must have cas/unenroll permission on
that namespace.  The namespace must also be unused, that is, there may
not be any object in the database that belongs to this namespace.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-remove [<i>options</i>] namespace <i>nickname</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>nickname   : nickname of the namespace to be unenrolled
</ul>

If the namespace nickname specified does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all
policy data on that namespace is purged.
<p>
<h3>Enrolling and Unenrolling Objects</h3>
<p>
To enroll a object, the user must have cas/enroll_object permission
(that is, must have permission to perform the enroll_object action on
the cas service type).  The enroll operation allows the user to choose a
userGroup to have cas/grantAll permission on the enrolled object. The
name of the object and the the namespace this object belongs to
identifies an object in the database and should be unique across the
CAS database.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-enroll [<i>options</i>] object <i>userGpName</i> <i>objectName</i> <i>namespaceNick</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>objectName : name of the object
  <li>namespaceNick: nickname of the namespace this object belongs to.
</ul>

To unenroll a object, the user must have cas/unenroll permission on
that object.  The object must also be unused, that is, there may not
be any object group in the database that this object belongs to

<pre>
casAdmin$ cas-remove [<i>options</i>] object <i>objName</i> <i>namespaceNick</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>objName    : name of the object to be unenrolled
  <li>namespaceNick: nickname of the namespace this object belongs to
</ul>

If the object specified does not exist, an error is <b>not</b> be
thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all policy data on
that object is purged.
<p>
<h3>Enrolling and Unenrolling Service Type</h3>
<p>
To enroll a service type, the user must have cas/enroll_serviceType
permission (that is, must have permission to perform the
enroll_serviceType action on the cas service type).  The enroll
operation allows the user to choose a userGroup to have cas/grantAll
permission on the enrolled service type. The service type name should
be unique across the CAS database.
<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-enroll [<i>options</i>] serviceType <i>userGpName</i> <i>serviceTypeName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>serviceTypeName: service type name
</ul>

To unenroll a service type, the user must have cas/unenroll permission
on that service type.  The service type must also be unused, that is,
there may not have any service type to action mapping.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-remove [<i>options</i>] serviceType <i>serviceTypeName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>serviceTypeName: service type name
</ul>

If the service type specified does not exist, an error is <b>not</b> be
thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all policy data on that
service type is purged.
<p>
<h3>Maintaining Service Types</h3>
<p>
To add an action mapping to a service type, the user must have
cas/create_group_entry permission on the service type.
<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-action [<i>options</i>] add <i>serviceTypeName</i> <i>actionName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>serviceTypeName: service type name
  <li>actionName: action name
</ul>

To remove a service type action mapping, the user must have
cas/delete_group_entry permission on the service type.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-action [<i>options</i>] remove <i>serviceTypeName</i> <i>actionName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>serviceTypeName: service type name
  <li>actionName: action name
</ul>

<p>If the group member being removed does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. 
<p>
<h3>Maintaining User Groups</h3>
<p>
To create a new user group, the user must have cas/create_user_group
permission(thats is, must have permission to perform create_user_group
action on cas service type). The user group name should be unique
across the CAS database. The create operation allows the user to
choose a user group to have cas/grantAll permission on the created
user group.  If the user group that is chosen to have cas/grantAll
permission is the new group created, then the user making this request
is added to the new group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] user create userGpName <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where :

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>groupName  : name of the user group being created
</ul>

To add to a user to a user group, the user must have
cas/add_group_entry permission on that particular user group. Only
user nicknames that exist in the CAS database can be valid members.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-add-entry [<i>options</i>] user <i>groupName</i> <i>nickname</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : user group name to which the memeber needs to be added
  <li>nickname   : nickname of the user to be added to this group.
</ul>

To remove a user from a user group, the user must have cas/remove_group_entry
permission on that particular user group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-remove-entry [<i>options</i>] user <i>groupName</i> <i>nickname</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : user group name to which the memeber needs to be added
  <li>nickname   : nickname of the user to be added to this group.
</ul>

<p>If the group member being removed does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. 
<p>
To delete a user group, the user must have cas/delete_user_group entry
permission on that user group. The group must be empty and also not be
referenced from other entities in the database(for example should not
be a memeber of some object group and such).

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] user delete <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : name of the user group to be deleted
</ul>

If the user group specified does not exist, an error is <b>not</b> be
thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all policy data on that
user group is purged.
<p>
<h3>Maintaining Object Groups</h3>
<p>
To create a new object group, the user must have
cas/create_object_group permission(thats is, must have permission to
perform create_object_group action on cas service type). The object
group name should be unique across the CAS database. The create
operation allows the user to choose a user group to have cas/grantAll
permission on the created object group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] object create <i>userGpName</i> <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>groupName  : name of the user group being created
</ul>

To add to a member, (an object group can have the following CasObjects
as members, object, user, user group, service type, namespace or trust
anchor) to a object group, the user must have cas/add_group_entry
permission on that particular object group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-add-entry [<i>options</i>] object <i>groupName</i> <i>objectSpecDesc</i> <i>objcetSpec</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : object group name to which the memeber needs to be added
  <li>objectSpecDesc: type of CasObject (trustAnchor (or) user (or)
		userGroup (or) object (or) namespace (or) service Type)
  <li>objectSpec : the identifier for the CasObject the user is adding
	   (nickname (or) nickname (or) groupName (or) 
	   objectNamespace objectName (or) nickname (or) serviceTypeName)
</ul>

To remove an object from a object group, the user must have
cas/remove_group_entry permission on that particular object group:

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-remove-entry [<i>options</i>] object <i>groupName</i> <i>objectSpec</i> <i>objectSpecDesc</i>
</pre>

where

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : user group name to which the memeber needs to be added
  <li>objectSpecDesc: type of CasObject (trustAnchor (or) user (or)
		userGroup (or) object (or) namespace (or) service Type
  <li>objectSpec : the identifier for the CasObject the user is adding
	   (nickname (or) nickname (or) groupName (or) 
	   objectNamespace objectName (or) nickname (or) serviceTypeName)
</ul>

If the group member being removed does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown.
<p> 
To delete a object group, the user must have cas/delete_user_group entry
permission on that object group. The group must be empty.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] object delete <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : name of the object group to be deleted
</ul>

If the object group specified does not exist, an error is <b>not</b> be
thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all policy data on that
user group is purged.
<p>
<h3>Maintaining Service/Action Groups</h3>
<p>
To create a new service/action group, the user must have
cas/create_serviceAction_group permission(that is, must have
permission to perform create_serviceAction_group action on cas service
type). The serviceAction group name should be unique across the CAS
database. The create operation allows the user to choose a user group
to have cas/grantAll permission on the created serviceAction group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] serviceAction create <i>userGpName</i> <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGpName : the user group to which cas/grantAll permission should be
	   granted on this trust anchor entity
  <li>groupName  : name of the serviceAction group being created
</ul>

To add to a service/Action to a serviceAction group, the user must have
cas/add_group_entry permission on that particular serviceAction group
(that is, must have permission to perform add_group_entry action on
that service action group)

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-add-entry [<i>options</i>] serviceAction <i>groupName</i> <i>serviceTypeName</i> <i>actionName</i>
</pre>

where

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : user group name to which the member needs to be added
  <li>serviceTypeName : service type name part of mapping to be added to group
  <li>actionName : action name part of mapping to be added to group
</ul>

To remove a service/Action from a serviceAction group, the user must have
cas/remove_group_entry permission on that particular serviceAction
group.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-remove-entry [<i>options</i>] serviceAction <i>groupName</i> <i>serviceTypeName</i> <i>actionName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : user group name to which the memeber needs to be added
  <li>serviceTypeName : service type name part of mapping to be added to group
  <li>actionName : action name part of mapping to be added to group
</ul>

If the action being removed does not exist, an error is <b>not</b> thrown.
<p>
To delete a serviceAction group, the user must have cas/delete_user_group
entry permission on that serviceAction group. The group must be empty
and also must not be referenced from any other entity in the
database. (for example should not be a memeber of some object group
and such)

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-group-admin [<i>options</i>] serviceAction delete <i>groupName</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>groupName  : name of the user group to be deleted
</ul>

If the service action group specified does not exist, an error is
<b>not</b> thrown. If the unenroll operation is successfull all
policy data on that serviceAction group is purged.
<p>

<h3> Maintaining Permissions </h3>
<p>
The user may grant permissions to a user group, on a object or object
group to perform a service action or service action group (that is to
perform any action that is a member of the service action group to
which permission is granted), provided the user has has both:

<ul>
  <li>cas/grant permission on the object or object group
  <li>permission to perform the service action or service action
        group on the object or object group.
</ul>

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-rights-admin [<i>options</i>] grant <i>userGroupName</i>  <i>objectSpecDesc</i> <i>objectSpec</i>  <i>actionSpecDesc</i> <i>actionSpec</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGroupName : the user group to grant permission for.
  <li>objectSpec : identifier for object or object group 
  <li>objectSpecDesc : type (object or objectGroup)
  <li>actionSpec : identifier for action or action  group
  <li>actionSpecDesc : type (serviceAction or serviceActionGp)
</ul>

The user may revoke a policy in the CAS database provided the user has
cas/revoke permission on the object or object group on whch the policy
is defined.

<pre>
  casAdmin$ cas-rights-admin [<i>options</i>] revoke <i>userGroupName</i>  <i>objectSpecDesc</i> <i>objectSpec</i>  <i>actionSpecDesc</i> <i>actionSpec</i>
</pre>

where:

<ul>
  <li>options    : <a href="#client-options">client options</a>
  <li>userGroupName : the user group to grant permission for.
  <li>objectSpecDesc: type of CasObject (trustAnchor (or) user (or)
		      userGroup (or) object (or) namespace (or) serviceType
		      (or) userGroup (or) 
  <li>objectSpec : identifier for object or object group 
  <li>actionSpec : identifier for action or action  group
  <li>actionSpecDesc : type (serviceAction or serviceActionGp)
</ul>

a Community Authorization service. Alice's role is primary to
administer the CAS server. Bob is an analyst who needs read access to
much of the community data. Carol is a scientist who needs to be able
to both read and write community data.

<p>These examples show how Alice adds the users Bob and Carol to the CAS
server, then adds a ftp server with some data available to the
community and then add permissions for the users using the cas
administration clients.

<p>These examples assume that Alice has installed the CAS server and
bootstrap the database with herself as super user. Please refer to <a
href="./installGuide.html">installation documentation</a> for details. 

<p> Assume Alice's nickname on the CAS server is <i>alice</i> and at
bootstrap has created a user group <i>suGroup</i>,which has super user
permissions on the database. Say, the CAS serivce URL is
<i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i>

<p>All commands listed below assume that enviroment variable
GLOBUS_LOCATION has been set to point to the GT3 core install and that
the commands are run ftom GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin. Also, say an environment
variable CAS_SERVER_URL has been set to point to the CAS server URL,
<i>http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/base/cas/CASService</i>
<p>
<b>1. Adding a user group </b>

<p> Since at the time of booting up the CAS server, only one user
group that has super user permissions on the CAS server is created,
Alice might want to create another user group to which new users maybe
added and permissions to newly enrolled CAS entities may be
given. This also eases the process of giving same rights to many
users.Given they are two types of roles in the community she might
want to create two groups, <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>.

<p>Also, all permissions on the newly created group will be given to
users of a particular user group. Say, Alice would like all users of
the user group <i>analysts</i> to be able to manipulate the group.

<p>To create a new user group Alice uses the <i>cas-group-admin</i>
client.It requires a name for the new group being created, say
<i>analysts</i>. 

<pre>
alice%  cas-group-admin user create analysts analysts
</pre>

This will create a user group <i>analysts</i> and give all users in
that group the permission to manage the group (i.e add users, remove
users and so on).

She can similarly create a group called <i>scientist</i>
<p>
<b>2. Adding trust anchor.</b>

<p>
Prior to adding Bob and Carol to CAS server, Alice needs to ensure
that the trust anchors for both have been added. If they share the
same trust anchor with Alice then this can be skipped, since at
bootstrap Alice's trust anchor would have been added to the database. 

<p>Say, Alice and Carol share a trust anchor different from
Bobs's. Then Alice needs to add the trust anchor used by Bob by using
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>trustAnchor</i> option.  She
needs to provide details about the trust anchor such as the
authentication method and authentication data used.

<pre>
alice%  cas-enroll trustAnchor analysts AbcTrust X509 "/C=US/O=some/CN=ABC CA"
</pre>

The above will enroll a trust anchor with nickname <i>AbcTrust</i>,
who uses <i>X509</i> as authentication method and has the DN specified
in the command. The members of the <i>analysts</i> user group are
given all rights on this object. This implies that any user who has
this trust anchor, would present credentials signed by this trust
anchor.

<p>
<b>3. Adding users.</b>
<p>

Now, Alice can add Bob and Carol as users using the <i>cas-enroll</i>
command with the <i>user</i> option. She needs to provide the user's
subject DN and reference to trust anchor used by the user. As with any
entity added to the CAS server, a user group whose members will have
all permissions on that entity needs to be chosen. Say, Alice would
like the members of user group <i>suUser</i> to be able to
maninipulate the user entity <i>Bob</i>.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll user suUser bob "/O=Our Community/CN=Bob Foo" AbcTrust
</pre>

Alice uses a simliar command to add Carol to the CAS database.

<p>
<b>4. Adding users to user group.</b>

<p>CAS server allows rights to be assigned only to user groups and not
to individual users. Hence before Alice can assign rights to Bob or
Carol, she needs to add them to some user group. She does this by
using <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> client with the <i>user</i> option to
indicate she is adding to a user group. This client requires the group
name and nick name of the user who needs to be added. So to add Bob to
<i>analysts</i> group, the command would be,

<pre>
alice% cas-group-add-entry user analysts bob
</pre>

<p>If a user group <i>scientists</i> was created, Carol can be added
as a member similarly.

<p>
<b>4. Adding a new FTP server.</b>

<p>Alice now has the community users in the database and
organized. She now wants to add some resources. The community
currently has a single ftp server, foo.bar.edu, available to it, so
she is going to add this to the CAS database.

<p>Each resource or object in the CAS server has a namespace
associated to it that defines some features like the comparison
algorithm that needs to be used when this object name is used for
comparison and maybe the base URL that should be prefixed to objects
that belong to this namespace. In this case, Alice can chooses to use
<i>FTPDirectoryTree</i> namespace that is added to the CAS server at
bootup.

Now, she adds the ftp server to the CAS database, using the
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with the <i>object</i> option.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/* FTPDirectoryTree
</pre>

This adds the ftp server as an object and gives all members of the
<i>suGroup</i> rights to manipulate the object.

<p> To be able to grant/revoke access on indiviual directories,
objects with the directory. Say, if Alice would like to be able to
manipulate the <i>data</i> on the server as a separate entity, the the
following will add an object for that.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll object suGroup ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/* FTPDirectoryTree
</pre>

<p>
<b>4. Creating an object group </b>
<p>
Alice suspects the community will end up have more directories
containing data on other servers that will have identical polices as
the /data directory on foo.bar.edu. So she is going to create an
object group called <i>data</i> and assign foo.bar.edu/data to this
group. This will allow her to grant rights on this group and easily
add other directories to this group later

<p>To create a group called <i>data</i> she uses the
<i>cas-group-admin</i> client with <i>group</i> and <i>create</i>
option.

<pre>
alice% cas-group-admin object create suGroup data
</pre>

This creates an object group called <i>data</i> and the members of
<i>suGroup</i> get all rights on this group and hence should be able
to add/remove members, grant rights to add/delete from this group to
others and also delete this group.

<p>
<b>5. Adding members to object group </b>
<p>

Alice now can add foo.bar.edu/data to the <i>data</i> group. She can
do this by using the <i>cas-group-add-entry</i> with the <i>object</i>
option. To add the above described object,
<i>ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*</i> in namespace <i>FooFTPNamespace</i>,
to object group <i>data</i>, the following would be the command.

<pre>
alice% cas-group-add-entry object data object FooFTPNamespace ftp://foo.bar.edu/data/*
</pre>

In the above command, the first <i>object</i> refers to the group
type, <i>data</i> is the name of the object group, <i>object</i>
refers to the type of CAS entity that is being added as memeber and
the last two parameters define the namespace and the object that needs
to be added.

<p>
<b>6. Adding service types </b>
<p>
Alice now needs to add information about the kind of rights that can
be granted for these objects. These are stored as <i>service types</i>
and relevant actions are mapped to these service types.

<p>In this scenario, the kind of service types that Alice should add
would be <i>file</i>, <i>directory</i> and so on. To do so, the
<i>cas-enroll</i> client with <i>serviceType</i> option maybe used. To
add a service type called <i>file</i> and give members of
<i>suGroup</i> all rights on this service type, she uses the following
command.

<pre>
alice% cas-enroll serviceType suGroup file
</pre>

<p>
<b>7. Adding action mappings </b>
<p>
The relevant action mappings to the above mentioned service types
would be <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> and so on. Alice needs to add these
mappings to the database so that she can grant rights that allow a
user to have <i>file/read</i> or <i>file/write</i> permissions on some
object.

<p> To add action mappings to a service type, she uses the
<i>cas-action</i> client with <i>add</i> option. The following command
should add a mapping of action <i>read</i> to service type
<i>file</i>.

<pre>
alice% cas-action add file add
</pre>

Similarly she can add other mapping like <i>write</i> to this service type.

<p>
<b>8. Grant permissions. </b>
<p>
Alice now has resources in the object group <i>data</i> and users in the
user groups <i>analysts</i> and <i>scientists</i>. She now wants to grant
permissions on <i>data</i> group to the analysts and scientists, namely
read permissions to the analysts and read and write permissions to the
scientists.

<p> To grant permissions the <i>cas-rights-admin</i> with the
<i>grant</i> option needs to be used. To give read permissions to the
analysts group, the command that needs to be run would be

<pre>
alice% cas-rights-admin grant analysts objectGroup data serviceAction file read</pre>

She similarly grants rights to <i>scientists</i> group.
