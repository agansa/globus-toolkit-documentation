The Reliable File Transfer Service component in the GT 3.2 alpha release 
contains bug fixes and extended functionality. In particular, this version of 
Reliable File Transfer Service supports recursive directory copy between GridFTP
servers that support MLSD/MLST features. The schemas of the service have been re
worked which increased the scalability of service significantly. A new service 
instance level option has been added that would turn on data channel reuse if 
your request consists of multiple transfers between same hosts which would 
further enhance the performance. A new command line client has been added 
which in addition to being able to submit transfer requests to service, can 
also serve as notification sink, to display number of transfers done/failed etc.
