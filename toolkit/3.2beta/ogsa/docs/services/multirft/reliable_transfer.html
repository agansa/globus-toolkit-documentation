<h1>Reliable File Transfer Service <span class=blue>[Final]</span></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) is an OGSA based service that
provides interfaces for controlling and monitoring 3rd party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfer
is hosted inside of a grid service so it can be managed using the soft
state model and queried using the ServiceData interfaces available to
all grid services. It is essentially a reliable and recoverable version
of the GT2 globus-url-copy tool and more.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites and Dependencies</h2>

<p> The Prerequisites to RFT are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Core Final Distribution</li>
    <li>GridFTP Server with a Host Certificate</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>

<p>PostgreSQL is used to store the state of the transfer to allow
for restart after failures. The interface to PostgreSQL is JDBC so any
DBMS that supports JDBC can be used, although no other has been tested. </p>

<p>GridFTP perfoms the actual file transfer. </p>

<p>GridFTP server can only be run on Unix or Linux. There are 2 ways to
get GridFTP: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Packaged with the core GT3 Final installation</li>
    <li>As part of the Globus Toolkit 2.4 distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't already have GridFTP from GT2 installed, use the GT3
bundled version. In either case, configuration instructions are
documented below.</p>

<h2>PostgreSQL Setup</h2>

<p>PostgreSQL can be installed both on Unix and on Windows. For setup
instructions, see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www3.us.postgresql.org/sitess.html">
Detailed Unix PostgreSQL Instructions</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.ejip.net/faq/postgresql_win_setup_faq.jsp">
Detailed Windows PostgreSQL Instructions</a><br>
(Only the first four steps are needed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a summary of what you need to do after installation:</p>

<ul>
<h3>Unix Specific Setup</h3>

<p>Login as root.</p>
<pre class=command>
# adduser postgres
# mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
# chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
# su - postgres
</pre>

</ul>

<ul>
<h3>Windows Specific Setup</h3>

<p>To run postgreSQL under Windows you need to install <a
 href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, and enable the
following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database -&gt; postgresql</li>
<li>Utils -&gt; bzip2</li>
<li>Base -&gt; libreadline5</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing these components you also need to install <a
 href="http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/cygipc/index.html">CygIPC</a>.</p>

<p>Now start the ipc_daemon from a cygwin shell e.g:</p>

<pre class=command>
$ /cygdrive/c/cygwin/usr/local/bin/ipc-daemon.exe &amp;
</pre>

<p>That's it, now you should be able to use psql and postgres as if
on a Unix machine. Note however that you will be using the username
'Administrator' as opposed to 'postgres'</p>

</ul>

<p>After completing either the Unix or Windows specific setup above, do
the following from your user shell (postgres or Administrator).</p>

<pre class=command>
$ export PGDATA=/usr/local/pgsql/data
$ initdb
$ createdb ogsa
$ psql -d ogsa -f rft_schema_ogsa.sql
</pre>
(rft_schema_ogsa.sql is provided in the ogsa distribution root, under
the etc directory)

<p> To start the db server run: </p>
<pre class=command>
$ pgctl -o&nbsp; "-i" -l logfile start
</pre>

<a name="gridftp"></a>
<h2>Configure and Run a GridFTP Server</h2>

<p>Typically two GridFTP servers on separate machines are used to perform
a file transfer. However to perform a simple test of RFT, one GridFTP
server is sufficient. Another alternative is to start two GridFTP servers
on one machine using different ports.</p>

<p>A properly installed host certificate is required to run GridFTP. See
the <a href="3.0beta/ogsa/docs/admin/">Admin Guide</a>, Security
Configuration for details.</p>

<ul>
<h3>Run a GridFTP Server</h3>

<p>As root, start a GridFTP server as follows:</p>

<pre class=command>
$ $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd -a -S [-p &lt;port&gt;]
</pre>

<p>GLOBUS_LOCATION is an environment variable set to the root directory of
your Globus Core Installation.</p>

<p>The "-S" will send the process to the background.<br>
The -p specifies an available port that GridFTP will listen on. If it's
in use, try another.</p>

<p> <b>Testing GridFTP - Moving a test file</b> </p>
<p>Create a file named <code>/tmp/file1</code> and run the following
command (This command should be run as user and not root): </p>
<pre>    globus-url-copy -s "`grid-cert-info -subject`" \<br>        gsiftp://localhost:5678/tmp/file1 \<br>        file:///tmp/file2<br></pre>
<p>Check to make sure that /tmp/file2 now exists.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Configure a GridFTP Server</h3>

<p>If you want a GridFTP server to be started automatically when
requests come in over a particular socket, then configure your system as
follows. Otherwise, this step may be ignored. </p>

<p> If you already have a GT2 GridFTP server installed, skip this step. </p>

<p> Make the following changes to your system as root. </p>

<p>Add this entry to /etc/services: </p>

<pre class=command>
gsiftp  2811/tcp
</pre>

<p>Depending on whether your host is running inetd or xinetd, you will
need to modify its configuration accordingly.</p>

<ul>
    <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
    Add the following entry, <i>all on one line</i>, to /etc/inetd.conf.
    Replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value of
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your environment.</p>

    <pre class=command>gsiftp  stream  tcp     nowait  root
    /usr/bin/env env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
    GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION</pre>

    <p><b>New to 2.2:</b> This entry has changed from the entry provided
    for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
    Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions
    from the install section, you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp;
    This requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the server can
    dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp;
    To accomplish the setting of the environment variable in inetd,
    we use /usr/bin/env (the location may vary on your system) to first
    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and then to call in.ftpd itself.</p>

    <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security
    update to your installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up
    dynamically without your having to rebuild it.</p>

    <p><b>Xinetd</b><br>
    For xinetd, add a file named "grid-ftp" to the /etc/xinetd.d/
    directory with the following contents. Be sure to replace
    GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in
    your environment.</p>

    <pre class=command>
service gsiftp
{
    instances               = 1000
    socket_type             = stream
    wait                    = no
    user                    = root
    env                     = LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib
    server                  = GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd
    server_args             = -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION
    log_on_success         += DURATION USERID
    log_on_failure         += USERID
    nice                    = 10
    disable                 = no
}</pre>

    <p><b>New to 2.2:</b> This entry has changed from the   entry provided
    for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
    Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions from
    the install section,   you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp; This
    requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so   that the server can
    dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp;
    To accomplish the setting of the environment variable in xinetd, we use
    the "env   =" option to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the gatekeeper's
    environment. </p>

    <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security
    update to your installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up
    dynamically without your having to rebuild it.</p>
</ul>

<p>The -G GLOBUS_LOCATION (remember to substitute your real
GLOBUS_LOCATION) tells the in.ftpd to look for ftpaccess in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION.&nbsp; If you do not specify this flag, the server will
use /etc/ftpaccess.</p>

<p>After you have added the gridftp service to either inetd or xinetd,
notify inetd (or xinetd) that its configuration file has changed as
follows:</p>

<ul>
    <p><b>For Inetd:</b><br>
    On most linux systems, you can simply run:</p>
    <pre class=command>
# killall -HUP inetd</pre>

    <p>On other systems, the following has the same effect:</p>
    
    <pre class=command>
# ps aux | grep inetd | awk '{print   $2;}' | xargs kill -HUP</pre>

    <p><b>For Xinetd:</b><br>
    On most linux systems, you can simply run:</p>
    
    <pre class=command>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart</pre>

    <p>On other systems (or if that doesn't work), see man xinetd.</p>
</ul>

<p>GridFTP uses /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile for authorization, just
like GRAM.</p>

</ul>
<h2>RFT Grid Service Setup</h2>

<p>The Core Final distributions includes a deployable GAR for RFT named
<b>multirft.gar</b>.</p>

<p>First, set the following parameters in multirft-server-config.wsdd:</p>

<ul>
    <p><b>JdbcDriver</b>: Name of the JDBC Driver for the database you
    want to use. For a PostgreSQL installation as described above this value
    is: org.postgresql.Driver

    <p>The driver is shipped along with our distribution.</p>

    <p><b>connectionURL</b>: URL for the Database in order make the
    connection. For postgres this is jdbc:postgresql:&lt;db&gt;, and in our
    example above it would be jdbc:postgresql:ogsa <br>

    <p><b>username</b>: Local user with access to the database. (On windows
    this would be Administrator) <br>

    <p><b>password</b>: Password set up to access the database for the
    particular user. </p>

    <p>Deploy the gar by running the following command in $GLOBUS_LOCATION:</p>

    <pre class=command>
$ ant -f build-packages.xml deployGar \
    -Dgar.name=&lt;location of multirft.gar&gt;</pre>
</ul>

<h2>Build the GAR from Source Distribution</h2>

<p>This step is optional.</p>

<p> If you downloaded the RFT source code then you can make a deployable
gar file as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the ogsacore.javadir property in build.xml to point to
ogsa/impl/java directory in your ogsa installation (or you can override
the default property by doing  ant -Dogsacore.dir=&lt;your ogsa
installation&gt; compile) <br>
Run: </p>

<li>
<pre class=command>
$ cd data_management/multirft
$ ant deployGar</pre>

<p>This builds a gar that can be deployed in a service container. Now
update the multi-rft-server-config.wsdd and deploy the GAR as described
above.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Testing the RFT Service using the Command Line Client</h2>

<ol>
<li>Deploy multirft.gar
<pre class=command>$ source setenv.sh</pre>

<li>You can provide the list of transfers in the form of a file. The
format of the file is as follows :<br>

<br>(the "# comments" are provided for explanation of the parameters and
should not be included in the transfers list )<br>

<pre class=command>
true        # type of transfer true=binary false=ascii
16000       # block size in bytes
16000       # TCP buffer size in bytes
false       # Notpt
1           # Number of parallel streams
true        # DCAU
2           # Concurrency
gsiftp://dg0n1.mcs.anl.gov/sandbox/madduri/smalltest    # source URL1
gsiftp://dg0n1.mcs.anl.gov/sandbox/madduri/test1        # destination URL1
gsiftp://dg0n1.mcs.anl.gov/sandbox/madduri/smalltest    # source URL2
gsiftp://dg0n1.mcs.anl.gov/sandbox/madduri/test2        # destination URL2</pre>

<li>Submit the transfer to the deployed RFT service:
    <pre class=command>
$ java org.globus.ogsa.gui.RFTClient \
    &lt;handle to RFT factory&gt; \
    &lt;path to transfers list&gt; <br></pre>

</ol>
