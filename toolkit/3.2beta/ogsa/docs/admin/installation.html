    <h1>GT3 3.2 Installation</h1>

    <h2>Required Tools</h2>

    <ul>
    <li> <b><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">JDK 1.3.1+</a></b> or
	JRE if you don't need to build any source.  Some known sources
	of JDK version related troubles: Some higher level services
	like the Index Service and Execution Services use <a
	href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/">Xindice</a>, which has
	an incompatibility with Sun's 1.3.1 JDK on some platforms.
	See <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/faq.html#faq-N10067">
	Xindice FAQ</a> for more details.  Version 1.4.1 of the JDK has
	experience hanging issues during compilation.  There are no
	known troubles with JDK 1.4.2.
	<br>
	
    <li> <b><a
	href="http://java.sun.com/products/jaas/index-10.html">JAAS
	library<a/></b> is required as a separate download if you are
	using JDK 1.3.x<br>
	
    <li> <b><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Jakarta Ant 1.5</a></b>
	(required for source distribution, and recommended for binary
	distribution). You can continue to use ant 1.4.1 if you replace
	crimson.jar in your $ANT_HOME/lib directory with xerces.jar that comes
	with our distribution.<br>

    <li><b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">YACC
	(or bison)</a></b> is required to build Cbindings and the
	ogsi-find-service-data client from source.  Your compiler may
	already have it installed, but you can download the GNU
	version if it is not available on your system.
	
  </ul>

    <h2>Optional Tools</h2>

    <ul>
    <li><b><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Jakarta Tomcat</a>
    4.1.24</b>.  4.0.6 has also been tested to work.  We also
	provide a standalone web service container for testing
	purposes, which is why Tomcat is optional.<br>

    <li><b><a href="http://www.junit.org">Junit 3.8.1</a></b> if you want to
	run tests from source.</li><br>

    <li><b><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">JDBC compliant
	database</a></b>.  The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service
	and Replica Location Service (RLS) use a database backend.
	For license reasons, we ship the Postgresql JDBC driver, but
	other JDBC compliant databases should be usable.<br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation on UNIX</h2>

    <p>There is a walkthrough <a href="example.html"> with a
    transcript of an actual installation</a>.</p>

    <h3>Installing Ant:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download Ant 1.5 distribution from <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant</a>.
    The current distribution as of this writing is 1.5.3.
    
<li>Unzip ant into your preferred location and set the ANT_HOME
environment to point to this location.
<li>Add $ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH environment
<li>Download <a href="http://www.junit.org">junit</a> and install it
    into $ANT_HOME/lib.
</ol>

    <h3>Installing JDK 1.4.2:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Follow either Sun or IBM's instructions for installing JDK 1.4.1
<li>Set JAVA_HOME to the installation directory, and put
$JAVA_HOME/bin on your PATH
</ol>

<h3>Installing a JDBC compliant database:</h3>  

<p>In this example, we'll use postgresql.  If you're familiar with
other JDBC databases like MySQL, you can adapt the instructions to use
them instead.  The database is used by RFT and RLS.

<ol>
<li>Download Postgresql from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>
<li>First, you need to make sure that postmaster will be started with
the "-i" flag to allow TCP/IP based connections.  This will be in
/etc/init.d/postgresql.  Secondly, if you want to allow remote hosts
to connect to your DB, you will need to edit pg_hba.conf.  By default,
this will only allow connections from 127.0.0.1.

<li>If you install from RPMs, you can initialize the DB by simply
running /etc/init.d/postgresql start
<li>We will create a new database user and create two databases after
installing GT3.
</ol>

    <h3>Installing GT3:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perform the installation as a non-root user.
<li>Download the GT3 base installer bundle from the <a
    href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/download.html">download page</a>.

<li> As part of the GRAM security architecture, it is important that
the account under which you plan to run the GT3 container is a member
of the group that installs the software. This group should only
contain privileged members.

<li>Open the .tar.gz, and run "./install-gt3 /path/to/install".
    Make sure that ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME are set, and
    that 'ant' and 'java' are on your PATH.  If you are using
    JDK 1.3.1, make sure JAAS is in your CLASSPATH before you
    run the installer. 
    
<li>Don't panic!  GPT may spit out some WARNING messages.
    Don't worry about Perl version complaints.  It works with 5.6.1,
    5.8.0, and 5.005.

<li>Now you are ready to use many services in core.  If you are using
JDK 1.4.x, copy $GLOBUS_LOCATION/endorsed/xalan.jar to
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed.  See the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/security/Java/installation.html#Using+JDK+1.4.0">Apache XML security page</a>
for more details.

<li>Proceed to the <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a>
    section for information on acquiring certificates and setting up
    MMJFS.  Until you have run "install-gt3-mmjfs", you will still
    need your installer directory.
</ul>
