 <h2>Installation and Versioning Notes</h2> 

<p>Note this code is still of experimental nature and therefore the required
build files and samples are only available in the source distribution of GT3
Core. We have tested all the samples with JBOSS 3.2.1 default server and
WebSphere Adanced Single Server Edition v4.0. WebSphere requires an additional
step to set up a database manually for the entity bean sample, and those scripts
have only been tested on Windows. Both in JBOSS as well as in Websphere you can
however customize the database to use as source for the sample yourself, please
consult the respective product documentation for more information. We generate a
gateway that is hosted by a Grid service container which then delegates to your
EJB container of choice. The EJB gateway can run under Tomcat or our standalone
container. We have tested the gateway with Tomcat 4.0.6. </p>

<h2>Overall Design</h2> 

The general design rational behind this functionality is to assume that you have
an existing EJB application that you want to expose as a set of Grid services
without having to change your application. Both

Session and Entity EJBs can be exposed as grid services, we only require you to
feed the tools with the EJB Home and Remote interfaces, in order to generate the
required gateway. The Grid service is in itself stateless but will retrive all
its application sate from the Bean. This means that you can recreate the Grid
service instance after for example a server crash, and it will be mapped to the
existing Bean state if you use the same primary key (which is mapped off to the
GSH).&nbsp;
<p>For the tool to work you need to point it to a directory where you have
extracted the contents of your EJB, and then point the tool to the Remote and
Home interfaces through configuration before running the code generator. Below
we show how this is done for JBOSS and WebShpere respectively for the provided
samples.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Common EJB Configuration</h2>

Open the ejb.properties file in your ogsa java build root directoy (ogsa/impl/java)
and uncomment and/or change the following entries to match your environment:

<p>
<b>ejb.dir</b> - the absolute directory of where the contents of your EJB has been extracted<br>
<b>ejb.home</b> - the class that contains the home interface<br>
<b>ejb.remote</b> - the class that contains the remote interface<br>
<b>ejb.exposeHomeService</b> - allows you to use the EJB Home interface to create services if true. If false you will need to use the standard OGSI interfaces (factory) to create your service.<br>
<b>tomcat.dir</b> - the root of your tomcat installation<br>

</p>

<h2>Configuration to Run EJBs in JBOSS</h2>

<p>

Open the ejb.properties file in your ogsa java build root directoy (ogsa/impl/java)
and uncomment and/or change the following entries to match your environment:
<p>
<b>containerType</b> - should be &quot;jboss&quot;<br>
<b>jboss.deployedJar</b> - the jar that is to be deployed in jboss<br>
<b>jboss.dir</b> - should point to the root of your jboss installation
<h2>Configuration to Run EJBs in WebSphere</h2>

<p>

Open the ejb.properties file in your ogsa java build root directoy (ogsa/impl/java)
and uncomment and/or change the following entries to match your environment:
<p>
<b>containerType</b> - should be &quot;websphere&quot;<br>
<b>websphere.deployedJar</b> - a jar that was constructed by the WebSphere assembly tool to deploy the beans. Note this jar is only used to get client side stubs, it is not deployed in Websphere by our tools, they assume that this jar is already deployed as an application in the WebSphere server<br>
<b>websphere.dir</b> - should point to the root of your websphere app server installation - typically /Websphere/AppServer<br>
<b>webspere.ejb.db</b> - as noted above for websphere you need to set up the database as a separate step, on windows we automate this process for you if you point this property to an Enhydra instantDB script (the database comes with the WebSphere installation)<br>
<b>websphere.create.db.command</b> - we have customized the samples create db script in Websphere for windows. To pick up our customization point this property to createDB.bat<br>

<h2>Generating the Gateway</h2><p>After configuring your environment of choice
and setting up the mapping to the bean you want to expose as described above you
only have to run:
<pre>ant ejbService</pre>
If that succeeds you are ready to start up your appserver and tomcat/or the
standalone container. To start up the standalone container to host the EJB
gateways run:
<pre>ant startEJBContainer -Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt;</pre>
<p>The port defaults to 8080, which will clash with the default JBOSS port, so please pick another port if you are running JBOSS.<br>

<h2>Running the Samples</h2>

Before deploying the samples make sure to compile the EJB classes first. To compile the EJB classes do:

<pre>ant -f build-ejb.xml samples</pre>

<b>Lower Case Conversion Session Bean</b><br>
After having deployed this service following the steps described above you can
test it as follows:
<ol>
<li>
Make sure your EJB container is running as well as the standalone container
or Tomcat
</li>
<li>
Make sure your environment is set properly using <a href="users_guide.html#Setenv">setenv scripts</a>
</li>
<li>
Run java org.globus.ogsa.client.CreateService http://&lt;gateway host&gt;:&lt;gateway port&gt;/ogsa/services/org/someone/LowerCaseFactoryService
</li>
<li>
Run java org.someone.LowClient &lt;the handle returned by CreateService&gt; myTestString
</li>
</ol>
<b>Person CMP Entity Bean</b><br>
Make sure you have enabled the ejb.exposeHomeService property, then:<br>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure your EJB container is running as well as the standalone container
or Tomcat
</li>
<li>
Make sure your environment is set properly using <a href="users_guide.html#Setenv">setenv scripts</a>
</li>
<li>
Run java org.good.PersonHomeClient http://&lt;gateway host&gt;:&lt;gateway port&gt;/ogsa/services/org/good/PersonHomeFactoryService myService
</li>
<li>
Run java org.good.PersonClient http://&lt;gateway host&gt;:&lt;gateway
port&gt;/ogsa/services/org/good/PersonHomeFactoryService/myService set myName
</li>
<li>
Run java org.good.PersonClient http://&lt;gateway host&gt;:&lt;gateway
port&gt;/ogsa/services/org/good/PersonHomeFactoryService/myService&nbsp;
</li>
</ol>
<h2> Notes on Exposing the Home Interface </h2>

You can expose the home interface as a factory service or you can rely on
default create and find methods and only expose the remote interface.
<p>
If you don't expose the home interface then:
<ul>
    <li>A Session bean must have a no-argument create method.</li>
    
    <li>An Entity bean must have a findByPrimaryKey method that takes one
    parameter which must be a String, an Integer or a Long.
    <p>
    The path part of the url that names the service is the primary key of 
    the entity bean. So if you had a "Person" entity bean you would find
    and instance with a primary key "123" like this:
<pre>
java org.globus.ogsa.impl.core.factory.client.CreateService http://127.0.0.1:8080/ogsa/services/org/yourpackage/PersonFactoryService 123
</pre>
If it can't find an entity bean with that key it will try to call
<pre>
home.create(123);
</pre>
and then you use it like this:
<pre>
java org.yourpackage.YourClient http://127.0.0.1:8080/ogsa/services/org/yourpackage/PersonFactoryService/123
</pre>
</ul>

If you choose to expose a home service then all of the methods on
your home interface that return a single instance of the remote interface
will become a factory service.  Generally this means all of the create() and
find() methods that don't return an enumeration of remotes.
<p>
    You can use it like an ordinary ejb:
<pre>
    String serviceUrl = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:8080/ogsa/services/org/yourpackage/PersonHomeFactoryService/myHome&quot;;
    PersonHome home = (PersonHome) EJBServiceClient.createHomeService(&quot;org.yourpackage.PersonHome&quot;, &quot;org.yourpackage.Person&quot;, serviceUrl);
    Person remote = home.create(new Integer(123));
    
    or Person someOtherRemote = home.findBySomeMethod(blah, blah); or whatever you want
</pre>    
    see <a href="../impl/java/build/javadocs/org/globus/ogsa/client/EJBServiceClient.html">org.globus.ogsa.client.EJBServiceClient
</a> for more information
<br>
<h2> Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
If you have JNDI problems, or if tomcat can't find the home interface then 
look at the parameters in server-config.wsdd.
<p>
If you need to change the wsdl it generated you can run
"ant -buildfile build-ejb.xml ejbToTomcat&quot;
to redeploy the ejb after changing the wsdl
<p>
If you have other problems try
"ant ejbClean&quot; and then "ant ejbService" again.
