<h2>
1&nbsp;<a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
This User's Guide describes how to setup the toolkit, and how to run
the samples.
For a detailed description of how to write a
Grid service please refer to the <a href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's
Guide.</a> The current implementation is based on
the GGF <a href="http://www.ggf.org/ogsi-wg/">Open Grid Services
Infrastructure
v1.0</a> specification ( Draft 29,&nbsp; released on April 5, 2003).
The toolkit comes both in a source-, and a binary distribution.
The source distribution contains source for the core framework as well
as all
samples, whereas the binary distribution only has the source for the
samples.
When downloading the source you can easily build your own binary
distribution
to work with. The build and development environment is largely the same
in both distributions. For consistency this guide assumes you have a
binary
distribution (either downloaded from the web, or created from a source
cvs
checkout) unless otherwise stated. The binary distribution does not
require
you to download any external tools to run the samples (apart from a
Java
VM), we however recommend that you also in this case download the build
system we are using (ant), in order to make it easier to build, and
deploy
the samples, as well as writing your own services.
<p>Document conventions:
<br>
&lt;ogsa root&gt; refers to the location where you unpacked the
distribution
<br>
&lt;ogsa java root&gt; refers to the java root of the distribution. In
the source distribution case this is &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java and in
the
binary distribution it is the same as &lt;ogsa root&gt;
<br>
&lt;source dir&gt; this is the directory where the source resides, so
in the binary distribution it will be 'samples', and in the source
distribution
it will be 'src'.
</p>
<h2>
2&nbsp;<a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<h3>
2.1 Required Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">J2SE</a> 1.3.1 SDK or JRE if you
don't need to build any source (1.4.x has been tested to work but might
require some <a href="message_security.html#14VM">patching</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Jakarta Ant 1.5</a> (required for
source distribution, and recommended for binary distribution).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jaas/index-10.html">JAAS
library</a><a> (only if using J2SE 1.3.1) See </a><a
 href="security.html#JAASinstallation">JAAS installation</a>
instructions for details.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
2.2 Optional Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Jakarta Tomcat 4.1.29 or 5.0.18 <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat</a></li>
  <li>
Junit 3.8.1 <a href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>
(if you want
to run our tests in the source distribution)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
2.3 Distributed Tools</h3>
Our framework ships with a number of external tools. They are
automatically
picked up, so in general you don't have to worry about these. We
mention
the tools here for reference purposes, it is <b>not</b> recommended to
replace any of these tools by another version you may already have.
<ul>
  <li><a href="dependencies.html">Distributed tools list</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
2.4 Quick Start</h3>
If you have a binary distribution, and you just want to test and run
the
demo and samples quickly (without downloading any external tools) then
you can do the following:
<ol>
  <li>
Make sure to generate <a href="#CommandLineClient">command line clients</a>
and set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable first.
  </li>
  <li>
Start the grid service container by typing: globus-start-container -p
8080
(Starts up a server on port 8080)</li>
  <li>
Run the demo client by typing: globus-service-browser <a
 href="http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/core/registry/ContainerRegistryService?WSDL">http://localhost:8080/ogsa/services/core/registry/ContainerRegistryService</a></li>
</ol>
For a guide on how to use the ServiceBrowser demo see section 3
<h3>2.5 Installing the Build System</h3>
In order to build the source distribution or the samples in the binary
distribution you would need to download Jakarta Ant. We also use Ant as
a scripting tool to simplify testing and deployment.
<ol>
  <li>
Download Ant 1.5 distribution from <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant</a></li>
  <li>
Unzip ant into your preferred location and set the ANT_HOME environment
to point to this location</li>
  <li>
Put junit.jar (download from <a href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>)
into ANT_HOME/lib (only
necessary if you want to run the tests in the source distribution)</li>
  <li>
Add ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH environment</li>
</ol>
<h3>
2.6 Creating a Binary Distribution from a Source Distribution</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
Go to the &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java directory</li>
  <li>
type: ant dist</li>
  <li>
A binary distribution will be placed in &lt;ogsa
root&gt;/impl/java/build/ogsa-&lt;version&gt;</li>
</ol>
<h3>
2.7 Running the Samples using Ant</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
Run the standalone service container by typing: ant startContainer
[-Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt;]</li>
  <li>
Run the demo client by typing: ant gui [-Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt;]</li>
</ol>
Note, you can set the service.port property in the &lt;ogsa java
root&gt;/ogsa.properties
file to change the port the service container will listen on (default
is
8080). Alternatively you can pass in -Dservice.port=&lt;port&gt; on the
command
line. To stop the container use ant stopContainer or send it a kill
signal..
<h3>2.8 Tomcat Installation</h3>
You can run the entire framework and all the samples inside of the
standalone
service container we provide. However it was mainly designed for
testing
purposes, so the framework can also be deployed in Tomcat. To deploy the framework into Tomcat type:
<pre>
ant -Dtomcat.dir=&lt;tomcat root&gt; deployTomcat
</pre>
When using the Sun Java Hotspot VM you may also want to increase your
heap space for the Tomcat engine. You can do this by setting the -Xmx flag
to for instance -Xmx128m (128 MB max heap) in the CATALINA_OPTS environment.

<p><b>Note:</b> There is a known problem with the
AxisServlet in Tomcat causing an empty document to be returned with a
successful
HTTP status if the tomcat configuration is broken. To debug it further
please check the tomcat logs in &lt;tomcat root&gt;/logs/ or the log4j
logs
in the server (see section 7). The error returned to the client will be
a SaxException and look something like: 'Line=1: The root element is
required
in a well-formed document'.
</p>

<p>By default, the ogsi servlet runs in the ogsa/services app and schemas
are picked up from the <i>schema</i> directory of the ogsa app. 
In order to change this you can modify the WEB-INF/web.xml file, 
for example:&nbsp;
</p>
<pre>&lt;servlet&gt;<br>  &lt;servlet-name&gt;OgsiServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br>  &lt;display-name&gt;OGSI Container Servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;<br>  &lt;servlet-class&gt;<br>    org.globus.ogsa.server.OgsiServlet<br>  &lt;/servlet-class&gt;<br>  &lt;init-param&gt;<br>    &lt;param-name&gt;ogsiLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;<br>    &lt;param-value&gt;ogsa-test/services/&lt;/param-value&gt;<br>  &lt;/init-param&gt;<br>  &lt;init-param&gt;<br>    &lt;param-name&gt;schemaContext&lt;/param-name&gt;<br>    &lt;param-value&gt;ogsa-test&lt;/param-value&gt;<br>  &lt;/init-param&gt;<br>&lt;/servlet&gt;</pre>

<b>ogsiLocation</b> specifies the new path to the web app
<br>
<b>schemaContext</b> specifies what context should be used to pick up the schema files.

<h2>
3&nbsp;<a name="Samples"></a>Samples</h2>
<h3>
3.1 Sample Code</h3>
The sample WSDL and XML Schemas are located in &lt;ogsa
root&gt;/schema/samples.
The source code is located in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/impl/samples.
In the binary distribution source dir is 'samples', and in the source
distribution
it is 'src'. To build the samples type: ant samples. Many samples have
simple command line client demos in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/impl/samples/&lt;sample&gt;/client
and gui clients in &lt;ogsa java root&gt;/&lt;source
dir&gt;/org/globus/ogsa/gui.
<h3>3.2 Overview of&nbsp; Samples</h3>
<b>Counter</b>
<br>

container
outside of ant as described in section 2.4)
<p><b>Notification</b>
<br>
This is a demo designed to showcase notification subscriptions in a
gateway service
</p>
<p><b>Weather</b>

and
allows remote services to publish their GSHs and service data into a
community repository
of services
</p>
<p><b>Guide (off root directory)</b><br>
Samples discussed in <a href="java_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's
Guide</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Exception</b><br>
Shows examples of how to use our chained WSDL amd Java exception
framework<br>
<br>
<b>Array</b><br>
Demo showing how custom java objects can be used inside of arrays
</p>
<p><b>Any</b><br>
Service showing the use of xsd:any extensibility elements from Java.<br>
</p>
<h3>
3.3 Service Browser GUI</h3>
The service browser gui is designed using the Web Browser metaphor. You
can type in a URL (which is a GSH) to inspect and use a remote service,
which will be rendered in the GUI. The GUI framework retrieves the WSDL
document for the GSH (displayed in the WSDL tab) and maps Port Types
exposed
by this WSDL to GUI panes. If an appropriate GUI pane cannot be matched
with a given Port Type, a dynamic pane can be used which shapes itself
according to the methods exposed by the Port Type. Note in this case
you will
need to add type mappings explicitly to client-config.wsdd if you use
complex
types. The encoded counter sample can be used to showcase this with the
dynamic
gui if you enable client deployment in the build-samples.xml file.
<p>Look for a ServiceGroup Inspection pane to get a list of services
exposed
by an ServiceGroup service. The entries in this list can be viewed as
service
links, and by double clicking on the entries you follow the link and
render
the target service interface in the GUI.
</p>
<p>If a factory service is rendered, you can create new transient
service
instances that will be introspected the same way as described above.
</p>
<h2>
4&nbsp;<a name="HigherLevelServicePrototypes"></a>Common Higher
Level Base Services</h2>
We provide some common higher-level
services that are deployed into the container by default.<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Container Registry Service</span>
- This service exposes all services currently
available in a local container (JVM), but doesn't allow remote
registration.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ping Service</span> - This
service is used to ping a running service container.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Management Service</span> - This
service is used to stop (shutdown) a service
container and to manage the state of services running in the
container. It supports activation, deactivation and destroy operations
on any service in the container. Note that persistent services can't
be destroyed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="logging_service.pdf">Logging Management Service</a></span>
- This service allows one to remotely manage
the logging output of any logging sources that exist in the container,
e.g. services, handlers etc. 
<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
6&nbsp;<a name="LoggingAndDebugging"></a>Logging and Debugging</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Logging in the Globus Toolkit is based on the Jakarta Commons Logging
architecture.
Commons Logging provides a consistent interface for instrumenting
source code while at the same time allowing the user to plug-in a
different logging implementation.
The Globus Toolkit implements the Commons Logging interface and
provides the logging implementation.
<p>In addition the Globus Toolkit provides a logging Grid Service with
the following features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamically change the runtime logging characteristics of both
the hosting environment and the services running in it.
  </li>
  <li>Change the persistent logging configuration.
  </li>
  <li>Query or subscribe to a rolling window of the log entries as
service data.
  </li>
  <li>Query transient and persistent attributes as service data.
  </li>
  <li>Access to and management of logging as a Grid Service.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging Configuration</h3>
Basic logging is automatically configured and enabled during
installation.
No additional configuration is needed to enable logging.
This section is provided so that administrators can change the logging
configuration if needed.
<p>This section describes only the static configuration of logging.
The OgsiLogging service can be used to dynamically change the logging
configuration and options at runtime.
This can done using the service interface from a Grid Service client
application.
A panel is provided as part of the ServiceBrowser as an exmaple.
For details see the logging service detailed specification.
</p>
<p>The following files are used to configure logging:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>commons-logging.properties </li>
  <li>ogsilogging_parms.properties </li>
  <li>ogsilogging.properties
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>commons-logging.properties</h4>
This file is used by Jakarta Commons to find the LogFactory to use when
creating Loggers.
It must be in the classpath. This is the entire content:
<xmp>
org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory=org.globus.ogsa.impl.core.logging.OGSALogFactory
</xmp>
If the commons-logging.properties file is not found, and assuming a
factory was not specified in the system properties,
the behavior of commons LogFactory is to dynamically discover built-in
supported loggers.
If the log4j-1.2.x.jar file is found in the classpath, log4j will be
used. See the commons Logging LogFactory javadoc for details regarding
LogFactory implementation lookup.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4>ogsilogging_parm.properties</h4>
This file contains 2 parameters:
<p>1. <i>persistentAttributeLocation</i> contains the name of the file
which contains the detailed logging configuration.
It can be fully qualified or relative to the current directory.
In this example the file is located in the current directory.
<xmp> persistentAttributeLocation=ogsilogging.properties </xmp>
</p>
<p>2. <i>logDestinationBasePath</i> contains the base path of log
files for any logger with a file
desination.
The default setting is blank, which means the current working
directory. In the default Globus Toolkit container, this defaults to
the <code>&lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/java/</code> directory.
<xmp> logDestinationBasePath=
</xmp> </p>
<h4>ogsilogging.properties</h4>
This file contains the detailed logging settings for a Globus Toolkit
installation.
<p>There is one and only one default setting, which has the following
format:
<xmp> default=destination,level,group
</xmp>The "default" entry provides logging settings for any logger that
is not explicitly defined elsewhere in the ogsilogging.properties file.
</p>
<p>In addition to the default entry, there are configuration entries
for individual loggers.
Individual Logger entries have the following format:
<xmp> logger_name=destination,level,group
</xmp></p>
<p><i>Logger name</i>
<br>
logger_name is a string that matches what the log generating
application used to define it's logging entries.
It is typically the class name of the application generating the log
information, but it can be
any name that binds a set of contributors to an identified log stream. </p>
<p><i>Level</i>
<br>
The level is the key log-filtering item.
There are two views of level: the application view, and the
administrative view.
From the standpoint of the log generating application,
it selects one of the following levels indicating the log message
priority:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>DEBUG
  </li>
  <li>TRACE
  </li>
  <li>INFO
  </li>
  <li>WARN
  </li>
  <li>ERROR
  </li>
  <li>FATAL
  </li>
</ul>
From the administrative view, the level attribute contained in this
file is used for the hierarchical filtering of log message flows.
Valid level attributes, in hierarchical order are:
<ul>
  <li>ALL or DEBUG
  </li>
  <li>TRACE
  </li>
  <li>INFO
  </li>
  <li>WARN
  </li>
  <li>ERROR
  </li>
  <li>FATAL
  </li>
  <li>OFF
  </li>
</ul>
The administrator will set a level associated with a logger name from
one of the above.
The selection of a particular level enables all log filters below it.
For example, setting level to ALL or DEBUG causes all messages to be
logged.
Setting the level to TRACE also causes INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL level
messages to be logged.
Setting level to INFO causes WARN, ERROR, FATAL level messages to be
logged, and so on.
<p>Setting level to "OFF" disables all log messages for this logger.
</p>
<p><i>Destination</i>
<br>
The destination field is either "CONSOLE" or filename.
The filename is relative and will be pre-pended by the
logDestinationBasePath.
</p>
<p><i>Group</i>
<br>
This is an unmanaged tag, which can be used in group wide operations.
An attribute can only belong to one group.
Group is useful when programmatically changing the logging settings for
a group of loggers.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h4>Configuring The Logging Service</h4>
The OgsiLogging Grid Service is defined in the server-config.wsdd.
Following are the configurable parameters:
<p><i>logBufferSize</i> defines the number of entries in the log
messages buffer.
The log message buffer is a rolling (FIFO) list of the latest log
messages. <pre> &lt;parameter name="logBufferSize" value="12"/&gt;
</pre></p>
<p><i>logBufferSizeMax</i> defines the maximum size of any change in
log buffer size.
<pre> &lt;parameter name="logBufferSizeMax" value="1000"/&gt;
</pre></p>
<h4>Underlying Log Engine</h4>
Ogsi Logging uses Log4j in its implementation. The log4j-1.2.x.jar file
should be in the classpath.
<p>Any application using log4j directly instead of using commons APIs
will NOT be supported from a logging management standpoint.
Any discovered log4j.properties file will be in effect for direct
users.
Commons users will have OGSI Logging Management prevail and existing
log4j.properties files will have no effect.
For example, if a category logger is defined in log4j as DEBUG
but is defaulted by an ogsilogging.properties as WARN, then WARN is the
designated log level.
</p>
<h4>Logging in Tomcat</h4>
<p>
The deployTomcat target takes care of all the required logging setup in
the Tomcat
application server environment.
</p>
<h4>Tracing SOAP messages</h4>
Three methods for tracing SOAP messages are described.
<p>1. To trace SOAP messages on the wire you can use TcpMon from Apache
Axis. After setting the environment using <a href="#Setenv">setenv
scripts</a> you can run:
<pre>java org.apache.axis.utils.tcpmon [listenPort targetHost targetPort]</pre>
</p>
<p>If no arguments are used, you have to fill out these values in the
GUI.
</p>
<p>2. One method for logging SOAP messages is to add the
<code>org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler</code> to the
request or response chain
in the server-config.wsdd or client-config.wsdd files. For example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;requestFlow&gt;<br>  ...<br>  &lt;handler type="java:org.globus.ogsa.handlers.MessageLoggingHandler"/&gt;<br>  ...<br>&lt;requestFlow&gt;</pre>
<p>3. Another method for tracing SOAP messages is to enable logging for
selected Axis classes.
Add the following lines to the ogsilogging.properties file:
<pre>org.apache.client.Call=console,debug
org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender=console,debug
</pre>This will cause axis client side calls and Axis HTTP messages to
be logged. </p>
<h2>7&nbsp;<a name="SecuritySupport"></a>Security Support</h2>
<p>
We support message level security based on GSI, and
WS-Security. For more details look at a description of the current <a
 href="security.html">security support</a>. Transport security is no longer supported.</p>
<h2>
8&nbsp;<a name=".NETSupport"></a>.NET Support</h2>
There are a couple of .NET OGSI implementations:

We provide sample .NET OGSA code in our source distribution. It's used
for testing purposes only. We only provide simple OGSA clients and 
ServiceBrowser GUI. The sample .NET code makes use of the exact same WSDL
and XML Schemas as the Java implementation for all the samples and core
infrastructure components. The wsdl.exe tool is used for proxy generation
and the xsd.exe tool is used to compile the XML Schemas into C# types.
</p>
<p>In &lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/dotnet/client there are some experimental
.NET
SDK Framework clients. When building the clients, WSDL is inspected
from
a web server pointed to by the OGSA_SERVER environment variable (run
setenv.bat
to get default value). Type nmake to build the clients, and nmake test
to run some tests against a server running an OGSA container.
</p>
<p>&lt;ogsa root&gt;/impl/dotnet/client/gui also contains a simple
ServiceBrowser
developed in Visual Studio .NET. Note, you have to build the client
dlls
described in the previous step before building the gui.
</p>
<p>
Our .NET sample code requires Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1, and/or Visual Studio .NET 2003 (April 2003 release).

<h2>
9&nbsp;<a name="WebStartSupport"></a>Web Start Support</h2>
You can create a Java Web Start
enabled proof of concept distribution of ogsa core and samples by doing
the
following:
<ol>
<li>
Using the source distribution compile using the "ant webstart" command.
</li>
<li>
Copy the directory "ogsaweb" to the web server you wish to host the
implementation. (if you use our standalone server you can skip this
step and go directly to step 4)
</li>
<li>
Ensure the the mime type "application/x-java-jnlp-file jnlp" exists
in your target web server configuration (on Apache - /etc/mime.types)
</li>
<li>
Edit the ogsa.jnlp file to include the web server host address and the
address where you have deployed the ContainerRegistryService (this is
the last host configuration in the file).
</li>
<li>
Edit the bc.jnlp file to include the web server host address.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Before running the container startup script you need to set
-Dorg.globus.ogsa.server.webstart=enable
in your OPTIONS shell environment variable (see section 11 command line
clients
for details).</p>
<p>You should now be able to point your browser at &lt;web server
host&gt;/ogsaweb/ogsa.jnlp
to start the ServiceBrowser GUI client from a remote machine not
configured to
use OGSA.. We have tested the web start sample with JDK 1.3.1, and
WebStart
1.0.1.</p>
<h2>
10&nbsp;<a name="EJBServices"></a>EJB Services</h2>
We provide a code generator that allows you to expose already existing
Enterprise Java Beans, EJBs (both Session Beans and Entity Beans), as
Grid
services inside of an EJB container in a J2EE Application server. For
more
details on how to use the code generator see [<a
 href="ejb_services.html">ejb code gen</a>].
<h2>11 <a name="CommandLineClient"></a>Command Line Clients</h2>
<p>We provide a minimal set of generic command line clients that can be
used to
test your grid services. The command line clients for core are
implemented in
the org.globus.ogsa.client package. </p>
<p> To generate the command-line scripts for your target platform,
type <b>ant setup</b>. The scripts are generated in the bin/
directory.
For a given command-line tool, the corresponding script takes care
of setting the classpath and specifying the Java class name. You need
to set the
GLOBUS_LOCATION variable in your shell. Note for Windows users it may
happen
that you run out of environment variable character length. If you do
you can use
the <b>subst</b> command to map the actual GLOBUS_LOCATION to a volume
(e.g. subst f:
&lt;your globus location&gt;). On Unix/Linux you can use similar
workarounds
using <b>ln -s</b>, if the problem occurs.
</p>

</p>
<p>For detailed help on allowed arguments use the -help option. All
clients take
a handle to its target service, which it resolves. All services can
also be
invoked using all the security features described in the <a
 href="security.html">security
guide</a>.</p>
<h2>12 <a name="ScriptGeneration"></a>Command Line Script Generation</h2>
<p>
It is sometimes needed to launch a Java class from the command-line.
Bourne Shell and Windows batch scripts can be automatically generated
in order to hide from the user the setting of the classpath and the
specification of the Java class.
An example of this is the generation of the
<a href="#CommandLineClient">command-line clients</a> provided with
the platform.
</p>
<p>
To provide automatic generation of a client script, write an ant target
that calls the <i>generateLauncher</i> ant target in build-client.xml.
The following properties/parameters must be specified:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>${launcher-name}</i>: base name of script to generate.</li>
  <li><i>${class-name}</i>: name of Java class the script must call.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For instance:
</p>
<pre>    &lt;ant antfile="build-client.xml" target="generateLauncher"<br>         dir="${ogsa.root}"&gt;<br>        &lt;property name="launcher-name" value="myClient"/&gt;<br>        &lt;property name="class-name" value="org.mypackage.MyClient"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/ant&gt;<br></pre>
It is also possible to specify defaults JVM options and command-line
using the <i>${default.jvm.options}</i> and <i>${default.cmd.line}</i>
ant
properties.
<h2>13 <a name="Setenv"></a>Setenv Scripts</h2>
The setenv scripts can be used to set the proper classpath environment
variable in order to launch a Java class from the command-line. To run
the setenv script you must first set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment
variable. The GLOBUS_LOCATION should be set to the location of the GT3
distribution. To set the classpath on Windows execute "<i>%GLOBUS_LOCATION%\etc\globus-devel-env.bat</i>".
On Unix/Linux machines execute "<i>. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.sh</i>"
(for bash/sh) or "<i>source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.csh</i>" (for
csh/tcsh).
