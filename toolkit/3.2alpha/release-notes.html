<h3><a name="Core">Grid Services Core</a></h3>
<br>
The Globus Toolkit Grid Services Core component released in the 3.2
alpha release contains important bug fixes and improvements on existing
functionality. Changes include better deactivate semantics, a change in
the persistent grid service programming model, changes to the security
descriptor format, updated third party jars and more. Further
information can be found in the <a href="core_notes.html">Core release
notes</a>. &nbsp;
<br>
<h3><a name="Security">Security (GSI)</a></h3>
<br>
The Globus Toolkit Security component shipped in 3.2 alpha contains a
slew of bug fixes and various improvements. Improvements of note are
updated third party libraries, Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
support in Java, support for pluggable authorization in the GridFTP and
GT2 GRAM components and improved documentation. Also, the security
component will no longer ship with the Globus CA certificate. Users
requiring certificates for testing should take a look at the <a 
href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs">Globus Certificate Service</a> or
<a href="http://www.globus.org/security/simple-ca.html">Simple
CA</a>. Further information can be found in the <a
href="sec_notes.html">Security release notes</a>.
<br>
<h3><a name="GridFTP">GridFTP</a></h3>
<br>
The Globus Toolkit wuftpd based GridFTP server, its associated tools,
and libraries in the 3.2 alpha release contains important bug fixes and
improvements on existing functionality.&nbsp; Improvements include
support for platform independent, machine parseable, file info (MLST
and MLSD commands), a new checksum command (CKSM), support for the Unix
chmod command, and support for file globbing and directory moves, i.e.
globus-url-copy is no longer restricted to a single file.
globus-url-copy also now has command line options for all the
equivalent client library functionality. 
<br>
There is also a new, non-wuftpd based implementation of the GridFTP
server available in the alpha. It is in the early stages of
development and lacks many of the features, but it will give people a
first look at the new server and its architecture.
<br>
Further information can be
found in the <a href="gridftp_notes.html">GridFTP release notes</a>.
<br>
<h3><a name="XIO">XIO</a></h3>
Globus XIO is an extensible input/output library for the Globus
Toolkit&reg;. For this and future releases of the Globus Toolkit the
globus_xio library will provide all input and output functionality for
the C code.
<br>
Globus XIO will replace the globus_io library.&nbsp; A portability
layer is included with the release so legacy applications written to
globus_io will be supported, however it is recommended that future
applications code
straight to the globus_xio API.
<br>
For more information on the globus_xio see:<br>

Known issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>framework has a bug that appears when a fast processor is heavily
loaded yet the system performs IO operation extremely quickly. This bug
only appears in threaded builds of Globus, and is actively being
pursued. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="GRAM">GRAM</a></h3>
<br>
The Globus Toolkit Grid Services GRAM component in the 3.2 alpha
release contains important bug fixes and improvements on existing
functionality. Improvements include, local scheduler scripts that
reduce the chance of errors due to NFS caching delays and increase
scalability by reducing memory consumption, internationalization of MJS
faults. Fixes include, MJS job recovery now works and UHE GRIM
credential lifetime obeys user configuration. Further information
can be found in the <a href="gram_notes.html">GRAM release notes</a>.
<br>
<h3><a name="CAS">CAS</a></h3>
<br>
Included in GT 3.2 Alpha is the first production release of the
Community Authorization Service, or CAS. CAS is an authorization
system that allows for fine-grain (e.g. per file) access control of
Grid Resources. GT 3.2 Alpha includes the CAS Grid Service, which
allows for creating and administering rights, client tools and
libraries for using CAS, and a CAS-enabled GridFTP service (other
CAS-enabled services are expected in the 3.4 release). More
information on CAS can be found <a
href="http://www.globus.org/Security/CAS/GT3/">here</a>
<br>
This version of CAS uses the OASIS Security Assertion Markup
Language (SAML) standard.  Users should be aware that RSA Security
has identified four patents it believes could be relevant to
implementingcertain operational modes of the SAML specifications.  The
GlobusAlliance has established a license agreement with RSA covering
usage of SAML in the Globus Toolkit, however users who
redistribute SAML-enabled portions of the Globus Toolkit or use
SAML-enabled portions in their own applications should understand the
issue and may want to obtain a royalty-free license from RSA. For
information regarding the patent claims and a royalty-free reciprocal
license to the RSA patents, see:<br>
<a
href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/solutions/standards/saml/">http://www.rsasecurity.com/solutions/standards/saml/</a><br>
For sublicense rights to the RSA patents under the Globus
Toolkit Public License, see: <br>

<br>
<h3><a name="Information_Services">Information Services</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aggregator API changes to facilitate more interesting service
data aggregation services; as an example of this, we now have a second
index service, which publishes content as an OGSI ServiceGroup. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The ogsi-find-service-data C client now supports XSLT, which
means that you can write schema specific output without needing to
write and link in new C code. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Software version information is now published through the
hostinfo providers (and so appears in the host status info that is
published by GT3 GRAM). </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><a name="RFT">RFT</a></h3>
<br>
The Reliable File Transfer Service component in the GT 3.2 alpha
release contains bug fixes and extended functionality. In particular,
this version of Reliable File Transfer Service supports recursive
directory copy between GridFTP servers that support MLSD/MLST
features. The schemas of the service have been reworked which
increased the scalability of service significantly. A new service
instance level option has been added that turns on data channel
reuse if your request consists of multiple transfers between same
hosts which will further enhance performance. A new command line
client has been added, which in addition to being able to submit
transfer requests to service, can also serve as notification sink.
This allows one to display number of transfers done/failed etc. More
information can be found <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~madduri/release_notes.html">here</a>.
<br>
<h3><a name="RLS">RLS</a></h3>
<br>
The Replica Location Service component in the GT3.2 alpha release
containsbug fixes and extended functionality. In particular, this
version of theReplica Location Service supports the deployment of a
hierarchy of ReplicaLocation Index (RLI) nodes. In past RLS versions,
RLIs summarized mappinginformation from one or more Local Replica
Catalog (LRC) nodes. In the newversion, an RLS can be configured with
an arbitrary hierarchy of RLI nodes,where each RLI summarizes state
information for one or more lower-level LRC and/or RLI nodes. Further
information can be found in the <a href="rls_notes.html">RLS release
notes</a>. 
<br>
<h3><a name="CB">C Bindings</a></h3>
<br>
The C Bindings component of the Globus Toolkit in 3.2 alpha contains a number of bug fixes.  No new functionality was included in this release.  Important bug fixes include fixes for gt3_gram_client library for multiple job submission, as well as a number of fixes to memory handling in that library.  Also, support for Tru64 native compiler was improved.
<h3><a name="Issues">Known Issues</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There exists a race condition when running globusrun, see <a
href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1416">bug
1416</a></li>
<li>Switching from one GridFTP data channel protection level to
another in the same GridFTP session does currently not work. Note that
this should not impact anyone as everything still works fine if you
stick to your initial protection level.</li>
<li>The WU-Gridftp server has been modified to 
be able to make calls to an authorization library that uses callouts to make 
authorization decisions.  The 3.2 Alpha CAS callouts are not enabled
yet.  An update will be provided soon.</li>
