internationalized </li>
<li>For GT3 MJS, the local scheduler scripts have been improved to
provide better error messages </li>
<li>For both GT3 MJS and GT2 jobmanager, the local scheduler scripts

<h3>Known Problems</h3>   

<ul>
<li> GT2 gram, when a client submits a query (e.g. job cancel or
signal) to the jobmanager while the jobmanager is interacting with the
local resource (more specifically doing a posix_convert) a
non-threaded jobmanager will behave unpredictably, a threaded
jobmanager will likely deadlock.  A solution has been identified and
will be fixed in the beta release.</li>
</ul>
