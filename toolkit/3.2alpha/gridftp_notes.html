<h3>Wufptd based server, tools, and libraries</h3>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>1365</b> >4GB file transfers broken with '-p N' </li>
<li> <b>1309</b> multiple file FTP's seem to hang </li>
<li> <b>1306</b> "reached end of file" error </li>
<li> <b>1268</b> need passive mode for directory listings when using
ftp_client library </li>
<li> <b>798</b> modification_time function uses assumes MDTM result is
in local time zone </li>
<li> <b>555</b> chmod functionality in GridFTP library? </li>
</ul>

<h4>Server Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li> MLST: machine parsable single file info over control channel </li>
<li> MLSD: machine parsable directory listings over data channel </li>
<li> OPTS LIST: (gridftp extension) change data channel MODE that list
commands (LIST, NLST, MLSD) will use.  this allows us to reuse data
the data connection for recursive directory listings. </li>
<li>OPTS MLST: set the information that you wish to receive via the
MLST/MLSD commands</li>
<li>CKSM: get a checksum (currently only MD5 is supported) of full or
partial file.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Client Updates</h4>

globus-url-copy [options] <sourceURL> <destURL>
globus-url-copy [options] -f <filename>

<sourceURL> may contain wildcard characters * ? and [ ] character ranges.

<h3>Notes for new (non-wuftpd based) GridFTP server:</h3>

<h4>Compatibility Statement</h4>
The 3.2 version of GridFTP (our new server code base) and the 3.0 version of
GridFTP (wuftpd based) will be completely interoperable.  Specifically, they
both speak the same wire protocol, GridFTP V1.0 as defined by the draft in the
GGF, on the control channel.  They both speak the same data channel protocols,
which is stream (MODE S) and extended block mode (MODE E), which are also
defined in RFC 959 and the GridFTP v1.0 spec respectively.  Since the
globus_gridftp_client and globus_gridftp_control libraries implement the
control and data channel protocol, any code written to those APIs should work
equally well against or between either server.  I.e., any command the new
server implements should be interoperable with the old server.

<h4>Configuration</h4>
Basically, non-existent

<h4>Login/Security</h4>
The alpha has basically NO security.  It is run as a user (non-root) and then
will accept any connection attempt made.  There is no authentication or
encryption on the control channel, no authentication on the data channel.

<h4>Info/Configuration</h4>
TYPE, MODE (S and E), HELP, FEAT, OPTS, SBUF

<h4>Data Movement</h4>
PORT, PASV, STOR, RETR, ESTO, ERET

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
NOOP, ABOR, QUIT

<br>
There are no file system ops, no IPV6, no restart or performance markers for
the alpha.
