<p>Commodity Grid Kits (CoG) provide access to Grid services through a
particular framework. Below are the most popular CoG Kits in use today. 

<h2>Java CoG Kit</h2>

<p>The Java CoG Kit provides access to Grid services through the Java
framework. Components providing client and limited server side
capabilities are provided. Please check out the papers and document
sections for more information.</p>

<h2>Python CoG Kit</h2>

<p>To allow the use of the Globus toolkit from python I've been working
on using SWIG to generate the necessary interface code. Eventually this
should allow the use of the entire Globus toolkit from higher level
scripting languages like Python. Currently a substantial subset of the
Globus toolkit has been wrapped.</p>
