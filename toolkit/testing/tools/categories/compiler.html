When the C-based code is built under windows there are a significant number of
warnings: unreferenced variables, signed/unsigned mismatch, possible loss of
data due to type conversion, incompatible const qualifiers, pointer mismatch,
etc. Warnings aren't useful when one gets used to ignoring them. Once developers
agree on appropriate warning levels for gcc and windows, all code should be
required without warnings. In those rare cases where avoiding a warning is not
possible a #pragma should be used with an appropriate comment to disable that
warning.
