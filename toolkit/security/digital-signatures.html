<p>Using public key cryptography, it is possible to digitally "sign" a
piece of information.  Signing information essentially means assuring a
recipient of the information that the information hasn't been tampered
with since it left your hands.</p>

<p>To sign a piece of information, first compute a mathematical hash of the
information. (A hash is a condensed version of the information. The
algorithm used to compute this hash must be known to the recipient of
the information, but it isn't a secret.)  Using your private key,
encrypt the hash, and attach it to the message.  Make sure that the
recipient has your public key.</p>

<p>To verify that your signed message is authentic, the recipient of the
message will compute the hash of the message using the same hashing
algorithm you used, and will then decrypt the encrypted hash that you
attached to the message.  If the newly-computed hash and the decrypted
hash match, then it proves that you signed the message and that the
message has not been changed since you signed it.</p>
