<p>Proxies are certificates signed by the user, or by another proxy, that
do not require a password to submit a job.  They are intended for
short-term use, when the user is submitting many jobs and cannot be
troubled to repeat his password for every job.  The subject of a proxy
certificate is the same as the subject of the certificate that signed
it, with /CN=proxy added to the name.  The gatekeeper will accept any
job requests submitted by the user, as well as any proxies he has
created. 

<p>Proxies provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering
passwords, but are also less secure than the user's normal security
credential.  Therefore, they should always be user-readable only, and
should be deleted after they are no longer needed (or after they
expire).

<p>To create a proxy with the default expiration (12 hours), run the
grid-proxy-init program.  For example:

<ul>
% grid-proxy-init
</ul>

<p>The grid-proxy-init program can also take arguments to specify the
expiration and proxy key length.  For example:

<ul>
% grid-proxy-init -hours 8 -bits 512
</ul>

<p>To delete a proxy that was previously created with grid-proxy-init, run:

<ul>
% grid-proxy-destroy
</ul>
