<p>The most important thing to know about public key cryptography is that
unlike earlier cryptographic systems, it relies not on a single key (a
password or a secret "code"), but on two keys.  These keys are numbers
that are mathematically related in such a way that if either key is used
to encrypt a message, the other key must be used to decrypt it.  Also
important is the fact that it is next to impossible (with our current
knowledge of mathematics and available computing power) to obtain the
second key from the first one and/or any messages encoded with the first
key.</p>

<p>By making one of the keys available publicly (a public key) and keeping
the other key private (a private key), a person can prove that he or she
holds the private key simply by encrypting a message.  If the message
can be decrypted using the public key, the person must have used the
private key to encrypt the message.</p>

<p>Note that it is critical that private keys be kept private!  Anyone who
knows the private key can easily impersonate the owner.</p>
