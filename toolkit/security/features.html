<p>A number of sources have recently raised concerns about the security of
systems that use SSL (the Secure Socket Layer). These concerns are based
on a number of well-known attacks that can be made on such systems.

<p>One such <a
href=http://securityportal.com/cover/coverstory20001218.html>article</a>
points out that SSH and SSL as commonly in use today are mainly focused
on protection of data in flight and are not focused on truly identifying
end-points. Given this form of implementation, the emergence of the
dsniff toolkit makes it easier to thwart the security of connections
with these protocols by impersonating endpoints and making the security
provided by encryption meaningless.

<p>The well-known attacks outlined by this article are:

<ul>
<li>When using SSL on the web, servers that don't use a certificate
signed by a trusted CA are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks.
<li>Most people browsing the web do not use a personal certificate
to authenticate themselves so cannot prove that web-based
transactions were actually conducted by them or not.
<li>When using SSH, if the user is connecting to a new host or to
a host whose host key has changed, they have no way of
verifying the host key to be genuine, leaving themselves open
to a man-in-the-middle attack. 
</ul>

<p>GSI addresses all the attacks outlined above by using trusted CAs and
mutual authentication. If properly installed, maintained, and used, GSI
is not susceptible to the man in the middle attacks described in this
article. By having trusted CA issue certificates for all servers and
users and requiring mutual authentication, all parties can have
confidence in identity of whom they are interacting with.

<p>The problem of unknown sshd host keys is handled as part of the GSI-SSH
protocol by hashing the sshd host key, signing the result with the GSI
host certificate on the sshd host and sending this to the client. With
this information client now has the means to verify that a host key
belongs to the host it is connecting to and detect an attacker in the
middle.

<p>The conclusions of this article are to install IPsec and DNSSEC. Both
are good things that can be used to improve the protection provided by
GSI. DNSSEC helps make the key management (certificate issuance) harder
to subvert, making certificates a more reliable identifier, and also
makes DNS spoofing harder. IPsec makes man in the middle attacks harder
by denying IP spoofing, though trusted certificates and mutual
authentication used by GSI already server to prevent this.
