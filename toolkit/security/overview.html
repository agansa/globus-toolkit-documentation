<h1 class="first"><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>The GSI uses public key cryptography (also known as asymetric
cryptography) as the basis for its functionality.  Many of the terms and
concepts used in this description of the GSI come from its use of public
key cryptography.</p>

<p>A reference for detailed information about
public key cryptography is available in the book <a
href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook
of Applied Cryptography</a>, by A. Menezes,
P. van Oorschot, and S. Vanstone, CRC Press, 1996. <a
href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap8.pdf">Chapter 8</a>
of this book deals exclusively with public key cryptography.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the remainder of this overview,
you may find it helpful to review the concepts of <a
href=public-key-cryptography.html>public and private keys</a> and <a
href=digital-signatures.html>digital signatures</a>.</p>

<p>The primary motivations behind the GSI are:

<ul>

<li>The need for secure communication (authenticated and perhaps
confidential) between elements of a computational Grid.

<li>The need to support security across organizational boundaries,
thus prohibiting a centrally-managed security system.

<li>The need to support "single sign-on" for users of the Grid, including
delegation of credentials for computations that involve multiple resources
and/or sites.

</ul>

<h1>Certificates</h1>

<p>A central concept in GSI authentication is the certificate.  Every user
and service on the Grid is identified via a certificate, which contains
information vital to identifying and authenticating the user or service.

<p>A GSI certificate includes four primary pieces of information:

<ul>
<li>A subject name, which identifies the person or object that the
certificate represents.
<li>The public key belonging to the subject.
<li>The identity of a Certificate Authority (CA) that has
signed the certificate to certify that the public key and
the identity both belong to the subject.
<li>The digital signature of the named CA.
</ul>

<p>Note that a third party (a CA) is used to certify the link between the
public key and the subject in the certificate. In order to trust the
certificate and its contents, the CA's certificate must be trusted. The
link between the CA and its certificate must be established via some
non-cryptographic means, or else the system is not trustworthy.

<p>GSI certificates are encoded in the X.509 certificate format, a standard
data format for certificates established by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). These certificates can be shared with other public
key-based software, including commercial web browsers from Microsoft and
Netscape.

<h1>Mutual Authentication</h1>

<p>If two parties have certificates, and if both parties trust the CAs that
signed each other's certificates, then the two parties can prove to each
other that they are who they say they are.  This is known as mutual
authentication.  The GSI uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for its
mutual authentication protocol, which is described below. (SSL is also
known by a new, IETF standard name: Transport Layer Security, or TLS.)

<p>Before mutual authentication can occur, the parties involved must first
trust the CAs that signed each other's certificates.  In practice, this
means that they must have copies of the CAs' certificates--which contain
the CAs' public keys--and that they must trust that these certificates
really belong to the CAs.

<p>To mutually authenticate, the first person (A) establishes a connection
to the second person (B).  To start the authentication process, A gives
B his certificate.  The certificate tells B who A is claiming to be (the
identity), what A's public key is, and what CA is being used to certify
the certificate.  B will first make sure that the certificate is valid
by checking the CA's digital signature to make sure that the CA actually
signed the certificate and that the certificate hasn't been tampered
with.  (This is where B must trust the CA that signed A's certificate.)

<p>Once B has checked out A's certificate, B must make sure that A really
is the person identified in the certificate.  B generates a random
message and sends it to A, asking A to encrypt it.  A encrypts the
message using his private key, and sends it back to B.  B decrypts the
message using A's public key.  If this results in the original random
message, then B knows that A is who he says he is.

<p>Now that B trusts A's identity, the same operation must happen in
reverse.  B sends A her certificate, A validates the certificate and
sends a challenge message to be encrypted.  B encrypts the message and
sends it back to A, and A decrypts it and compares it with the original.
If it matches, then A knows that B is who she says she is.

<p>At this point, A and B have established a connection to each other and
are certain that they know each others' identities.

<h1>Confidential Communication</h1>

<p>By default, the GSI does not establish confidential  (encrypted)
communication between parties.  Once mutual authentication is performed,
the GSI gets out of the way so that communication can occur without the
overhead of constant encryption and decryption.

<p>The GSI can easily be used to establish a shared key for encryption if
confidential communication is desired. Recently relaxed United States
export laws now allow us to include encrypted communication as a
standard optional feature of the GSI.

<p>A related security feature is communication integrity. Integrity means
that an eavesdropper may be able to read communication between two
parties but is not able to modify the communication in any way. The GSI
provides communication integrity by default. (It can be turned off if
desired). Communication integrity introduces some overhead in
communication, but not as large an overhead as encryption.

<h1>Securing Private Keys</h1>

<p>The core GSI software provided by the Globus Toolkit expects the user's
private key to be stored in a file in the local computer's storage.  To
prevent other users of the computer from stealing the private key, the
file that contains the key is encrypted via a password (also known as a
pass phrase).  To use the GSI, the user must enter the pass phrase
required to decrypt the file containing their private key.

<p>We have also prototyped the use of cryptographic smartcards in
conjunction with the GSI. This allows users to store their private key
on a smartcard rather than in a filesystem, making it still more
difficult for others to gain access to the key.

<h1>Delegation and Single Sign-On</h1>

<p>The GSI provides a delegation capability: an extension of the standard
SSL protocol which reduces the number of times the user must enter his
pass phrase. If a Grid computation requires that several Grid resources
be used (each requiring mutual authentication), or if there is a need to
have agents (local or remote) requesting services on behalf of a user,
the need to re-enter the user's pass phrase can be avoided by creating a
proxy.

<p>A proxy consists of a new certificate (with a new public key in it) and
a new private key. The new certificate contains the owner's identity,
modified slightly to indicate that it is a proxy.  The new certificate
is signed by the owner, rather than a CA. (See diagram below.) The
certificate also includes a time notation after which the proxy should
no longer be accepted by others. Proxies have limited lifetimes.

<p><img width=500 height=140 src="images/gssapi1.gif">

<p>The proxy's private key must be kept secure, but because the proxy
isn't valid for very long, it doesn't have to kept quite as secure as
the owner's private key.  It is thus possible to store the proxy's
private key in a local storage system without being encrypted, as long
as the permissions on the file prevent anyone else from looking at them
easily.  Once a proxy is created and stored, the user can use the proxy
certificate and private key for mutual authentication without entering a
password.

<p>When proxies are used, the mutual authentication process differs
slightly. The remote party receives not only the proxy's certificate
(signed by the owner), but also the owner's certificate. During mutual
authentication, the owner's public key (obtained from her certificate)
is used to validate the signature on the proxy certificate. The CA's
public key is then used to validate the signature on the owner's
certificate. This establishes a chain of trust from the CA to the proxy
through the owner.

<p>Note that the GSI and software based on it (notably the Globus Toolkit,
GSI-SSH, and GridFTP) is currently the only software which supports the
delegation extensions to TLS (a.k.a. SSL).  The Globus Project is
actively working with the Grid Forum and the IETF to establish proxies
as a standard extension to TLS so that GSI proxies may be used with
other TLS software.
