    The following two specifications were
    submitted on 7/19/2002 to the Grid community for review and were discussed
    in an OGSA security BOF at GGF5 in Edinburgh.</p>
    <h2>
    The
    Security Architecture for Open Grid Services</h2>
    <p>This
    document proposes a strategy for addressing security within the Open Grid
    Services Architecture (OGSA). It defines a comprehensive Grid security
    architecture&nbsp;
    that supports, integrates and unifies popular security models,
    mechanisms, protocols, platforms and technologies in a way that enables a
    variety of systems to interoperate securely.
    This security architecture is intended to be consistent with the
    security model that is currently being defined for the Web services
    framework used
    to realize OGSA’s service-oriented architecture. The
    document presents a security model, describes a set of security components
    that need to be realized in the OGSA security architecture, and presents a
    set of use patterns that show how these components can be used together in a
    secure Grid environment. (<a href="ggf5-presentations/OGSASec-ggf5.pdf">Nataraj Nagaratnam's

    <h2>OGSA
    Security RoadMap</h2>
    <p>
    This document is a roadmap enumerating
    a set of proposed specifications to be
    defined in the Global Grid Forum in order to ensure interoperable implementations
    of the OGSA Security Architecture. The specifications in this
    roadmap leverage existing and emerging Web Services security specifications.
