  <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
  The Globus Toolkit version 3.2 introduces the ability to customize
  gridmap lookup (currently available in the Gatekeeper and GridFTP
  servers) as well as a mechanism for doing fine-grained authorization
  in the GRAM Jobmanager. Both of these features were built upon a new
  callout library based on runtime library loading. For information
  specific to these callouts take a look at the following two
  sections:

  <h3>Gridmap Callout</h3>
  
  The updated code contains a replacement for the gridmap lookup
  function used in previous versions of the Globus Toolkit. The replacement
  function looks for the callout configuration file and checks whether
  any mapping or authorization callouts are defined. If any callouts
  are defined, the function proceeds to call the defined callouts. If
  no mapping callout is defined or if no configuration file was found
  the function behaves like the gridmap lookup function it replaces
  (i.e. it does the normal Globus gridmap lookup). <br> 
  A paper describing a system using these callouts for integration
  with a site authorization system can be found <a
  href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C0303241/proc/papers/TUBT007.PDF">here</a> 

  <h3>GRAM callout</h3>

  The GRAM callout was implemented by placing explicit calls to the
  callout API in the GRAM Jobmanager code. These calls were placed at
  any of the entry points to Jobmanager functionality. Similar to the
  gridmap callout, these calls look for the callout configuration
  file, check whether any GRAM callouts are defined and then call any
  callouts that were found. Should no callouts be defined then the
  Jobmanager code will behave just like in previous releases of the
  toolkit (no authorization in the Jobmanager itself).

    <h4>Writing your own callout package</h4>
    
    <p><b>These instructions are not meant to be comprehensive and will
      improve as questions come up.
    </b><br/>
    <br/>

        Follow the directions on the <a
          href="../../docs/development/remote-cvs.html">
          CVS page</a> for building the GNU tools (ie follow steps 1-5) used
          for bootstrapping Globus packages. Now that you have the right
        tools, you can modify the example callout package to suit your
        needs by inserting your source and changing the Makefile.am, configure.in,
        pkgdata/pkg_data_src.gpt.in files. </p>
    <p>Once you have made your
        modifications, run the bootstrap script to regenerate build
        related files. Once you have regenerated the build
        environment, you can build the package using "./configure
        --with-flavor=" followed by "make" or "make
        install". If everything seems to be working to 
        satisfaction, you can generate a source package by running
        "make dist". </p>
    <h3>Deployment Information</h3>
    
    The current version of the code checks the following locations
    (in order) for the callout configurations file:

    <ul>
      <li> $GSI_AUTHZ_CONF </li>
      <li> /etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf </li>
      <li> $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gsi-authz.conf </li>
      <li> $HOME/.gsi-authz.conf </li>
    </ul>

  The code defines the following abstract callout types:

  <ul>
    <li>Gridmap Callout Types:</li>
    <ul>
      <li> <em> globus_mapping </em> Indicates a callout as described in
        section 4 of the <a
        href="GSI%20Authorization%20Callout%20Specification-04.pdf"> 
      Authorization Callout Specification </a></li>
      <li> <em> globus_authorization </em> Indicates a callout as described
        in section 5 of the <a
          href="GSI%20Authorization%20Callout%20Specification-04.pdf"> 
          Authorization Callout Specification </a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>GRAM Callout Type:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><em>globus_gram_jobmanager_authz</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  These are the abstract types to be used in the callout
  configuration file. The abstract type indicates a callback that
  takes certain arguments and provides certain
  functionality. You may define several callbacks of the same
  abstract type.

  <h2><a name="examples"></a>Building Example Packages</h2>
  
  To build and install the example packages you should do the
  following:

  <ul>
    <li>Install the Globus Toolkit version 3.2 or later</li>
    <li>Make sure $GLOBUS_LOCATION and $GPT_LOCATION are set
    correctly</li>
    <li>Run "${GPT_LOCATION}/sbin/gpt-build &lt;example callout package&gt;
    &lt;flavor&gt;", where "&lt;flavor&gt;" is the flavor you used to
    install the toolkit</li> 
    <li>Run "${GPT_LOCATION}/sbin/gpt-build &lt;example callout setup
    package&gt; &lt;flavor&gt;"</li> 
    <li>Run "${GPT_LOCATION}/sbin/gpt-postinstall" and follow the
    instructions printed by the setup package</li>
  </ul>
