<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article describes a new suite of software  for registering
  new Grid users. This system gives both users and administrators an easy interface
  for issuing and handling of Grid credentials (certificates). The following
  topics describe the basic components of the Registration Service, how it works
  and how to set it up. We then provide a real world example of a Grid Registration
  Service implemented by ESG.</p>
<p>This article is for developers who already have a basic understanding of using
  the Globus Toolkit. For more information, click <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2> <a name="what"></a>Description</h2>
<p>The Registration Service is a simple system that allows  users to register
  once on a Grid and obtain access to resources on the Grid. It was
  originally developed for the Earth System Grid (ESG) project to simplify the
  process of adding new users to their ESG Grid (see the section <a href="#ESGexample">Real
  Life Example: ESG</a> for details about their implementation.) </p>
<p>The basic requirements are security that gives users access to everything
  they need with only one sign on and a system to stores the users' credentials.</p>
<p>Security is provided by the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), the foundation
  of the Globus Toolkit, which is used as a common underlying basis for secure
  single sign on and mutual user-resource authentication. This tool can provide
  secure access control to all resources using public key infrastructure (PKI)
  with credentials from a Certificate Authority (CA). </p>
<p> The Registration Service uses an online registration process to generate,
  store, and access PKI credentials without the overhead normally associated
  with certificate generation. </p>
<p>The code base is modular and easy to drop
  into a frontend (both in terms of&nbsp; configuration and API ) and addresses
  core issues that a registration system might require. It provides the building
  blocks and the portal front end that allows you to construct a registration
  system to suit your needs.</p>
<h2>  <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture and Process </h2>
<p>The  Registration System integrates existing technologies such
  as SimpleCA (part of Globus Toolkit used to generate the GSI certificates)
  and MyProxy Server (to securely store the proxy certificates online.)</p>
<p>The registration software has two components:</p>
<ol>
  <li> a front end user interface with backend software that uses SimpleCA and
    MyProxy</li>
  <li> a JDBC compliant database to generate and store credentials and user information. </li>
</ol>
<p>The basic
      architecture is described in the following figure (in this case, the front
  end module is represented as a Web Portal, although any graphical user interface
  would suffice): </p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Registration System Architecture</em></p>
<p><img width="334" height="456" src="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/articles/setupRS/clip_image002.jpg"></p>
<p>The following table uses the ESG implementation as an example of the Registration
  Service process (the numbers correspond to the numbers in the above figure): </p>
<table width="650" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">1</td>
    <td><p>The user enters the ESG portal web site (<a href="http://www.earthsystemgrid.org/">www.earthsystemgrid.org</a>)
        and clicks on the registration link. He submits the required information
        (name, contact information, statement of work, etc) and selects his preferred
        username/password.</p>
        <p>The user receives an email with a URL (with a unique token) to confirm
          the contact information (email address). The user clicks on the provided
          link to continue the registration process. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">2</td>
    <td><p>The user's information is persisted in a database and the submitted
        request goes to the ESG Certificate Authority (CA).</p>
        <p> The CA reviews the information provided by the user, checks the contact
          information and decides whether to approve the request or reject it &ndash; based
          on ESG policies.</p>
        <p>If the request is rejected, an email is sent to the user notifying
          him of the decision and explaining why it was rejected.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">3</td>
    <td><p>If the CA approves the request, then the following happens: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Registration Service generates a GSI certificate for the user
            and places the long term credential in the MyProxy server. </li>
          <li> An email is sent to the user notifying him that his registration
            process has been completed successfully. </li>
      </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<h2><a name="ESGexample"></a>Real Life Example: ESG Registration Service</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, this Registration Service was originally developed
  for ESG (<a href="http://www.earthsystemgrid.org" target="_blank">www.earthsystemgrid.org</a>)
  to make it as easy as possible for new users to gain access to the ESG Grid.
  This system provides for secure access control to all ESG resources using public
  key infrastructure (PKI) with credentials from the ESG CA that was established
  by the collaboration. And with the online registration process, the Registration
  Service allows for a broad base of users to access &ldquo;public&rdquo; data
  while auditing access by remote users with whom ESG has no
  existing trust relationship, a requirement of research sponsors. </p>
<h3>Simple system </h3>
<p>The focus of this system is <em>ease of use</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The portal extensions (CGI scripts) have been developed to automate user
    registration requests. </li>
  <li>The system solicits basic data from the user, generates a certificate request
    for the ESG CA, and, if approved, generates a certificate and stores it in
    the MyProxy server, and gives the user an ID/password for MyProxy access. </li>
  <li>The approval/rejection of the request is based on ESG policy: in this case,
    everybody with a valid e-mail address and relevant/verifiable project description
    would be approved. </li>
  <li>The Registration Service also has an Administrator&rsquo;s interface that
    allows the CA administrator to accept/reject the user&rsquo;s request as
    well as to revoke the already issued certificates. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>Another major focus of this new user registration process was to make sure
  that users' credentials were known <strong>everywhere</strong> on the ESG Grid.
  To do this, we established the ESG accounts everywhere on the ESG Grid and
  mapped every user with ESG CA-issued certificates to these accounts. As a result,
  when a new user is registered with ESG, he automatically has access to ESG's
  resources. </p>
<p>The most important benefits of this system are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> users <strong>never</strong> have to deal with certificates!</li>
  <li> the portal can get a user certificate from the MyProxy server when needed
    on behalf of the user. </li>
</ul>
<h3>ESG Implementation </h3>
<p>The following details are specific to deploying the Registration Service for
  ESG: </p>
<ul>
  <li>All components are installed on dataportal.ucar.edu at NCAR.</li>
  <li>New users could register with the ESG portal by following the Registration
        link from the main ESG link: <a href="https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/">https://www.earthsystemgrid.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this implementation, ESG now has the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>An easy-to-use web user interface for new Grid users. </li>
  <li>An easy-to-use web administrative interface for managing user credentials. </li>
