<h2>jGlobus 2.0.0 Release</h2>

<p>
    The primary highlight of this release is the usage of JSSE as the security library instead of the pureTLS as has been historically used.
</p>

<h3>Key goals of this release</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Package naming stay the same.</li>
    <li>Classes will be ported just to be backwards-compatible which will be deprecated eventually.</li>
    <li>Deprecated classes will be replaced by new functionality</li>
    <li>The minimal required Java version will be 1.5</li>
</ul>
