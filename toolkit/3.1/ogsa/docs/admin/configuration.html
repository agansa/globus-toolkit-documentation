    <h1>GT3 Configuration</h1>

<h2>Security Configuration</h2>

<p>If you already have GT2 certificates and have /etc/grid-security
configured, you may skip this step.

<li>As root, set your GLOBUS_LOCATION to your GT3 install directory.  Run
<code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-gsi</code>
<li>Get a user certificate for yourself and your host.  Follow the
instructions at <a href="http://www.globus.org/gt2.2/admin/guide-verify.html">Verification of GT2</a>, starting with "Setting Your Environment", and ending with the section
titled "Host Certificate".  Your GLOBUS_LOCATION will be the directory
where GT3  is installed.
<P>Make sure you send in the certificate requests as a normal user,
not as root, as specified in the directions.
</ol>

<h2>MMJFS Configuration</h2>

<ol>

  <li>After you have hostcerts, run <code>install-gt3-mmjfs</code> in the installer directory
      
  <li>After installing MMJFS, go to /path/to/install/bin and run setperms.sh
    as root. This sets up
    the two setuid binaries (launch_uhe_setuid and globus-grim)
    required by the GT3 GRAM service. <b>It is important that the
    account under which you plan to run the GRAM master managed job
    factory is a member of the group that owns the launch_uhe_setuid
    program</b>. This group defaults to the default group of the
    installing user and should only contain privileged members.

<li>With the server configuration and setuid in place, we need to add
authorizations for who will be allowed to submit jobs.

<ol>
<li>First, create a /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile.  The syntax is to
have one line per user, with the certificate subject followed by the
user account name, like the following:<br>
<pre>"/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=mcs.anl.gov/CN=Charles Bacon" bacon</pre>
<li>Then, create /etc/grid-security/grim-port-type.xml<br>
<code>
&lt;authorized_port_types&gt;<br>
    &lt;port_type username="bacon"&gt;http://www.globus.org/namespaces/managed_job/managed_job/ManagedJobPortType&lt;/port_type&gt;<br>
&lt;/authorized_port_types&gt;<br>
</code>
</ol>

<li>Now that users can authorize to your server, it's time to start it
up.  You don't have to specify -p if you want 8080, but
    you can specify an alternate port if you need to.
    <ul><li><code>globus$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION=`pwd`</code>
	<li><code>globus$ bin/globus-start-container -p 8080</code></ul>


<li>With the container running, a client can submit a job.
    <ul>
      <li><code>bacon$ grid-proxy-init</code>
      <li><code>bacon$ bin/managed-job-globusrun -factory http://140.221.57.75:8080/ogsa/services/base/gram/MasterForkManagedJobFactoryService
	  -file etc/test.xml</code>
      <li>Note: your -factory URI will be different, including your
	  own IP address and port.  You can see the list of services
	  in the output of globus-start-container.  If you do not see
	  MasterForkManagedJobFactoryService, you might have skipped
	  install-gt3-mmjfs.
    </ul>

<li>Note that etc/test.xml may output to both ~/stdout and
    ~/stderr.  A successful run will append a line to the stdout file.

<li>In order to stop the container, issue the
following 2 commands in another terminal window, as the user who started the
container.  These will have the effect of issuing a controlled
stop command.
<ul>
    <li> <code>export X509_USER_PROXY=/tmp/x509cp_`whoami`_grim</code>
    <li> <code>globus-stop-container -secure soft</code>
</ul>
    
</ol>
</ol>
