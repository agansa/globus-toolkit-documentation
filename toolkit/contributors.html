            The Globus Toolkit also includes complementary work from the community, in

	    the form of contributions. The Globus Alliance gratefully acknowledges 

	    the following contributions to GT4:



	    <p> The <strong>Condor Project</strong> at the University of Wisconsin,

            led by Miron Livny, provided the persistent job manager features

            in pre-WS GRAM. The Condor team has also provided a number of patches to 

	    improve pre-WS GRAM, and has participated in pre-release testing of WS GRAM.<br>

<!-- 
<p> The fledgling <strong>Globus Documentation Project (GDP)</strong> contains

            important and useful material authored by people in the community.<br>

  [<a href  [<a href="http://gdp.globus.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Web_Links&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewlink&amp;cid=11">Link to the GDP's collection of GT4 documents</a>] </p> -->
 <p> The <strong>GT4 Friends Community Group</strong> provided invaluable

            testing and feedback on GT4 pre-releases.<br>

          <p> <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong> contributed build-related bug

            fixes for HP platforms.<br>

          <p> The <strong>Java CoG Kit Group</strong>, led by Gregor von Laszewski, 

	    has contributed a significant subset of Java APIs from the Java Cog Kit.  

	    It is called <i>JGlobus</i>.  The library provides extensive Java GSI 

	    support.  It also includes client-side Java APIs to 

	    pre-WS services such as MyProxy, Pre-WS GRAM, Pre-WS MDS 

	    and GridFTP.<br>

          <p>The Distributed Computing Department of <strong>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</strong> has contributed

            Python implementations of several Globus components, including pyGlobus, 

	    pyGridWare (also known as Python WS Core) and pyWSSecurity.<br>

  [<a href="http://www.lbl.gov">http://www.lbl.gov</a>] </p>

          <p> <strong>Northern Illinois University</strong> has contributed to

            the development of the WS GRAM Rendevous service.<br>

  [<a href="http://www.niu.edu">http://www.niu.edu</a>] </p>

          <p> <strong>Platform Computing</strong> has contributed the Community

            Scheduler Framework (CSF) for enabling consistent interface 

	    into different scheduling systems.<br>
