    <p>The following two privacy statements describe the Globus community's practices
       in regard to collecting and using personal information. One statement covers 
       the use of Globus Online Services (websites, email lists, anonymous FTP server) 
       and the other covers the use of Globus software. These areas are different 
       enough to merit separate privacy statements.</p>
